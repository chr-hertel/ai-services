Hello,

My name is Mateo Gomez and I visited Contoso Restaurant with my spouse for our anniversary last Thursday. I had heard
wonderful things about your food and service from my neighbors as I lived right down the street from you at 1234
Hollywood Boulevard. After a lovely stroll along the Santa Monica Pier, we decided to go for dinner at Contoso. But when
we got to the restaurant, we had to wait for 15 minutes just to get on the waiting list. After an hour of waiting to get
seated, we ordered two Surf and turf platters. To our absolute surprise, the food was very cold and dry. The whole
experience was just awful, and I expect a refund for our meal and an apology for that day. Please issue me a refund at
the earliest and call me on 123-456-7890 for any further questions.
