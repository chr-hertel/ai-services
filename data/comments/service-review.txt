Long waits...BUT FOR GOOD REASON. Some awesome Italian food and great vibes. Contoso Bistro always has live music or
events going on to keep you entertained. The food is good enough to keep me entertained though!

The Contoso Bistro lasagna is a classic! The outdoor back patio is such a vibe, especially in the summer. Great service
as well :) Love this place and will be back for more.
