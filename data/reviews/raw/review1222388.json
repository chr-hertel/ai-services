I am a huge fan and had even booked tickets to see it in New York on the 11th before they cancelled the early release. I had been waiting and waiting for it, eagerly listening to the soundtrack until I was so excited I nearly burst. Anyways, the movie did not disappoint. Much more edgier and visual than the play, the movie will appeal to any viewer, even those totally uninterested in the subject matter. The acting was spectacular, with the performances of newbies Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms really sticking out in my mind, they did a great job. Also, the chemistry between Wilson Jermaine Heredia and Jesse L. Martin was fantastic, I can only hope to find a love as great as theirs. Anthony Rapp and Adam Pascal made a perfect team, and Idina Menzel hasn\u0027t aged a day. Finally, Taye Diggs was the perfect bad guy, his performance was also stellar. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone over the age of 15. It teaches a lesson that needs to be taught, and everyone who sees this movie will leave a different person.\n\nGive in to love, or live in fear!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
