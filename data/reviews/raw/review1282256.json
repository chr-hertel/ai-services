Until then, I only had a well worn VHS copy of an old Night Flight broadcast, so the disc was a welcomed addition to my library. \n\nThere are a few extras on the disk, one of which is an interesting interview with Commando Cody (George Wallace), who interviewer Proctor insists on calling \"Commander\".\n\nProctor and Bergman also discuss their making of JMF. One disappointment was Bergman\u0027s completely unnecessary comments about the war in Afghanistan and the war on drugs. I guess I shouldn\u0027t be surprised that a guy who has made a living with his counterculture humor would have such a reflex attitude toward \"the establishment\", but I wish he had kept his ill conceived beliefs to himself. Funny and creative he is. Intelligent and astute he is not. To make matters worse, the entirety of the Proctor/Bergman dialog is plagued by oft-occurring audio dropouts (the rest of the disk is OK).\n\nThat said, it\u0027s still well worth buying. J-Men Forever is a hilarious movie and is one of my favorites.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
