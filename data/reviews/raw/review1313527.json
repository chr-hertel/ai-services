Great film and my header says it all. It\u0027s not Wyatt and the boys but it\u0027s of the same ilk. Very good film! Oh, I just come to believe that the Ozzie\u0027s are the best cinematographers; there films are just so rich and good looking. There is a lot of violence and it is graphic when portrayed yet, that adds to the character of the film. The film is fairly fast paced and Guy Pearce definitely draws you into his character with the his look (you can smell this guy\u0027s character - talk about stress). I would definitely recommended it based on the quality of the Australian background scenes - surrealistic. If you like shoot em ups, you like this!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
