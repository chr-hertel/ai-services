I never heard about that, but the story slowly involved me. The plot is quite original, (little spoilers) the \"fan fanatism\" in literature. The main actors are very well, with intense performance. A great example of making a big low-budget movie. I should not speak details, but the screenplay is brilliant, keeping the pace as an excellent thriller. We do feel as James Caan, looking for any possibility of scaping from what is becoming more an more a nightmare. Only a few moments ago I found out that was a Stephen King\u0027s best seller. For his fans, a wonderful film...and I hope they accept the end!" }
