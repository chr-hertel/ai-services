I thought this one was really good, from storyline on down to the casting of characters. It\u0027s wonderful to see Brent Spiner back in the line-up of any show, since he\u0027s a talented actor that tends to get overlooked as the \"android guy from Trek\". Carla Gugino is well cast and believable as Dr. Caffrey, who heads the Red Team. Peter Dinklage (of the Station Agent) is great as a wry-humoured mathematical genius who lightens the often dark premise of the show. The rest of the cast (Van Holt, Benedict, and Dutton) are excellent as well and round out the team fantastically. This show does have the same feel as the famed \"X-Files\" but it doesn\u0027t try to duplicate it. Love this show. I\u0027ll definitely be tuning in in the future." }
