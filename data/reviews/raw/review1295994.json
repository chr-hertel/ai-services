And then was surprised to see in the opening credits that Campbell Scott directed it and he sometimes does quirky things...\n\nThis film holds your attention and is quietly moving. Visually it was also captivating in its depiction of the desert, the sky and the rural aspect of living on the land the way the family was. The reminiscing voice-over aspect was well balanced in relation to the acting sequences as well.\n\nThis was a refreshing surprise.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
