The plot is witless and contrived, the songs are boring and the acting is wooden. Just when you think it couldn\u0027t get any worse, some ridiculous plot twist comes flying in from the clouds. \n\nI am no fan of Salman Khan and while I am still willing to give Ash a chance, this film is the sort of junk that gave her a bad reputation in the first place.\n\nI will say, however, that the photography and sound were good, so it wasn\u0027t completely painful to watch. It\u0027s only bad when you pay attention to the actors or the script.\n\nYou have better things to do with your time, believe me.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
