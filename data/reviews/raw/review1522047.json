I missed the huge decors, Monneypenny and, of course: Q. And the original Bond theme was not used as much as I would like. But there\u0027s lots of good news too. I was amazed by the performance of Daniel Craig. He really is the best Bond ever: cold blooded, realistic, charismatic... Compared to him, Pierce Brosnan is a pussy, Roger Moore a comedian. Who said that Timothy Dalton was the most dangerous Bond? Rubbish, Dalton looked looked like he felt the character of Bond was not good enough for him. Craig gave a new dimension to the character, with a little help of the director, of course. When Craig is in pain, it looks like he really is in pain. And sometimes he can be touching too. For once, the love part in a Bond movie is believable. Bond looks very in love with Vesper, and at the end of the movie he looked so lonely it hurts. If I was a girl, I\u0027d fall for Craig.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
