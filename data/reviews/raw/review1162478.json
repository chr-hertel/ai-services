It has to be quite difficult starting a network, both financially and otherwise...that\u0027s why they have no name hosts instead of some big time names. I wish the lesbian was less of a stereotypical \"bulldyke.\" I know they are still around, but aren\u0027t they a bit of a dying breed? Why not bring in a modern lesbian who isn\u0027t so angry all the time. I do like the young guy, but he isn\u0027t on enough. I haven\u0027t watched in quite a while, but saw a bunch of postings and figured I would put in my 2 cents. OH, and speaking of agendas...I like how the one poster accused the other of having an agenda and then shamelessly promotes the network, very silly! Maybe they will turn things around." }
