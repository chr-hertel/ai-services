There are lot\u0027s of little subtle things in the movie that you might not notice the first time through (I\u0027ve seen it twice now, and liked it better the second time).\n\nIf you don\u0027t like cars or driving, you probably won\u0027t enjoy it as much as I did, but it\u0027s still a great movie.\n\nFor what it\u0027s worth, I\u0027m not a NASCAR fan, nor do I follow any of the racing series (and haven\u0027t since I was a teenager), but I do enjoy driving, and I did belong to a Sports Car Club in college (and raced in Autocrosses and Road Rallies).", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
