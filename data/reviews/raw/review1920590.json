However, in this case, I just have to state that the producers really chose a poor title. It\u0027s not kinky, and yes, I know that softcore porn can\u0027t really be kinky, but this flick is not even kinky for softcore. It\u0027s way over on the other end of the spectrum... featuring couples that are romantic, faithful, and enjoying healthy relationships. And it\u0027s not a club either... as the couples who don\u0027t know each other end up together by accident.\n\nPlot: Click on the plot summary. There\u0027s not much more than that since there\u0027s not much time left for a plot. The sex scenes, while not excessively numerous (like in some of the wraparound story plots), are quite long. I\u0027d say the non-sex scenes take up only around 30% of screen time.\n\nActing: It\u0027s an ensemble effort with no real problems. Leah Riley and Matt Wilde are excellent as always, and everyone else is good.\n\nWomen: Top marks here. All five of the ladies are lovely, slender and have natural bodies. Right down my alley. The guys are fine except that Chris Lewis (aka Chris Gustafson) is getting a bit old and chubby for softcore.\n\nSex Scenes: The nine simulated sex scenes range from fair to good, but are mostly very average. They are very long (avg 6 min), mostly lower energy, and are very leisurely paced. In fact, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ve ever seen a softcore film where it takes so long to get to the simulated sex in some of the scenes. There\u0027s a huge emphasis on foreplay and body kissing (and I don\u0027t mean simulated oral) in some of the scenes. Not my cup of tea, but maybe good for those who like things slow and romantic. Which leads back to the \"opposite of kinky\" problem. The wild couple do have a threesome, but other than that everyone sticks to their partner. There\u0027s none of the sexual partner merry-go-round that you typically see in softcore flicks. Even the one girl/girl scene is a couple.\n\nOverall... very average, short on plot and long on sex, but the slow, romantic kind... not the kinky kind." }
