There were no scares. There was no gore. The characters had no depth and no personality. The set was a typical Japanese home with no character. You know immediately who will be left standing in the final moments, and therefore never feel tension when anyone is in trouble - you already know the outcome.\n\nThe movie begins with promise. The colors and angles will feel familiar if you saw the Ring, but it begins with promise, giving a mysterious death and a very creepy child. \n\nIt doesn\u0027t last, though. You soon realize that the deaths happen off camera and are usually unexplained. You realize the main ghost is a very confused looking Japanese woman with a facial expression that is supposed to be terror but is so over the top it\u0027s pure humor. And you\u0027ll realize the characters have no purpose other than to die. None of them say anything interesting, none have any unique characteristics. You could take the lines from one mouth and put them in another without noticing.\n\n*minor spoiler* The end is terrible, too. The ghost gets a character face to face, inches away, but saves the character instead of killing the character. Of course, this doesn\u0027t stop the ghost from stalking the character and giving the \"surprise\" in the end. Why didn\u0027t it just kill the character when it had the chance? *end spoiler*\n\nA movie with a decent concept but terrible, dull, and mindless execution. There\u0027s nothing confusing, nothing mysterious, nothing disturbing, nothing scary, nothing intelligent, and mostly nothing interesting to be seen in this movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
