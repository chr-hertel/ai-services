I am not a Pierce Brosnan fan, but he performs admirably the task of playing Ian Dunross, Tai Pan of the Noble House.The other characters jump off the screen in this crisp, vibrant and colorful DVD release.\n\nThe only objection I have is to the tiresome way they always have to play the full credits at the beginning of each segment of the mini-series. Why can\u0027t they have a credit chapter that only plays once? All in all, one of the better releases on DVD of an old VHS set.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
