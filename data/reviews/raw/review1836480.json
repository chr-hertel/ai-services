You can\u0027t go wrong with this one.\n\nThe production is low budget, but that actually works in its favor. The film has a grittiness that is entirely appropriate.\n\nThe script is first-rate and the actors are virtuosos across the board. There is not a note in it anywhere that rings false.\n\nIf you\u0027re tired of the sentimentalism and cartoonish characters usually associated with Dickens, you will be pleasantly surprised. There is none of that here. This is a story about real people. There are no saints, except for Rachel and she\u0027s a minor character, and no devils. Even the ostensible villain, Bounderby, is humanized.\n\nDickens on film doesn\u0027t get better than this.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
