Don\u0027t let this awful movie keep you from reading a detailed, organized, really good sci-fi book!\n\nThe only thing this movie has in common with the book is:\n\n1. Some of the names. 2. The fact a kid leaves his village and gets caught by some aliens.\n\nI am tired of people making movies-from-books and totally screwing them up - and BE has to be the worst of all time.\n\nIf you read the book you can gag while you watch, and if you haven\u0027t... well maybe you can sit through the whole thing.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
