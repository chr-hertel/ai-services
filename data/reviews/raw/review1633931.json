Not enough plot? Who cares? Over-the-top acting and speeches? Bring \u0027em on! Right wing propaganda? Oh give me a break.\n\nThe movie is absolute eye candy, and the theater where I saw it erupted into applause on more than one occasion. Gerard Butler is huge as King Leonides; he finally gets the role he\u0027s waiting for (remember Atilla the Hun? Timeline? Reign of Fire? Didn\u0027t think so.) I admit there are many historical inaccuracies, but if I want a history lesson I\u0027ll go to a class or watch the History Channel. When I go to the movies, I expect to be entertained. And boy, was I ever!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
