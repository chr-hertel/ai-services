I haven\u0027t seen all the episodes (it ran for a season before being canceled) but the ones I have seen weren\u0027t consistently funny. It was essentially just some up-and-coming comedians writing the show so they were giving it their best, but they weren\u0027t professionals yet - as a result some sketches are brilliant and others are just so-so.\n\nMy personal favorite has to be \"Die Hard 12: Die Hungry.\" This is one of the most authentic-looking movie-trailer-parodies I\u0027ve ever seen. It\u0027s hilarious - Stiller plays John McClane (Willis\u0027 role) and the narrator on the trailer is the same guy who did the actual Fox trailers for the \"Die Hard\" movies. It\u0027s hilarious stuff, and they get away with quite a lot - even using the logo and the real actors\u0027 names.\n\nIt\u0027s during skits like these that Stiller\u0027s comedic originality shone through - the show was canceled before being nominated for comedy awards. I recently saw on a TV special that it\u0027s likely the show would have been picked up for another season had it been nominated in advance, because after the nominations many more viewers sought out the show, having never heard of it before. But in the end, its cancellation worked out for the best - it become a cult hit and all the stars got careers." }
