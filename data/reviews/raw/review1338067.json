Their love was so strong i wanna have 1 like it in the future. I\u0027ve also read the novel and it\u0027s so good. I mean Jane Austen in this novel is a genius. Can any 1 tell me if there still any gentlemen left on earth (I DON\u0027T THINK SO) because they\u0027re gone with the wind. I never met a gentlemen in my whole life.\n\nPride and Prejudice is a movie u must see. U can\u0027t but 2 love it. What i love the most is when Mr. Bingley made a ball and Darcy was so cold and then he changed 180 degree. I also love when he told her how could he make amends after all what he had done to her but it\u0027s still isn\u0027t enough for him.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
