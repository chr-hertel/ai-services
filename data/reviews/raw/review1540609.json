Not very flattering to humanity I might add. But the funny thing is, surprising me; I find this a kind of beautiful movie. I had it at home for several weeks before actually having the nerve/mood to get into this kind of movie. I expected it to be much more depressing. In it\u0027s one strange way I find it to have it\u0027s own kind of positive twist on things even though characters and scenes can at times be really sickening. But stick with it. This is a concept kind of movie, you got to see the whole thing to appreciate that there really is a positive twist to it. I promise. The acting is all over impressive. This is a heart and soul, sweat and blood kind of movie from both director and cast and it\u0027s really, really worth watching. Not for fun maybe but for the experience of it and for the awakening of thoughts that will follow you after you experienced this movie. I really recommend it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
