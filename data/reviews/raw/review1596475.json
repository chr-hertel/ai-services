I haven\u0027t changed my mind! Very well done! And Tom Cruise is a sentimental favorite as he is a great actor, his popularity has only increased since 1993, and we share the same birthday! It\u0027s a real thriller. So much is going on in this movie and it keeps you in suspense the entire time......One of the original John Grisham movies, now a classic, and a very well-written story.........\n\nThe actress who plays Tom Cruise\u0027s wife is just beautiful, but she seems to have dropped out of sight since that movie. And she ironically seems to resemble Katie Holmes...........", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
