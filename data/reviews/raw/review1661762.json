This is Snakes on a Plane bad: terrible to the point of absolute enjoyment. PotC 3 parodies the current trend of epic movies far more effectively than the real parody \"Epic Movie.\" \n\nI had to remind myself constantly that the film wasn\u0027t TRYING to be awful, because the script and the fighting is substandard to the point of insanity. Even the scriptwriters themselves felt the need to remind the audience that they had, indeed, seen the first film, by including \"nostalgic\" throwback jokes every twelve minutes. These were thrown in amongst the already- contorted plot, with more subplots than tentacles on Davy Jones\u0027 face (and, like the tentacles, most of them ended with gaping holes).\n\nPlease, see this movie in all its brilliant absurdity, its terrific incongruity, its epic stupidity.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
