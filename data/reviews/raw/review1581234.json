I was hoping that at least one of the bad guys was going to get what they should have deserved. And possibly one or two of the kids were going to make it out alive, so disappointing ending to a disappointing movie. Now i saw devils rejects and thought that movie was awesome. Maybe it\u0027s cause the bad guys did end up getting what was coming to them. But this stupid flick was all about the gore level \u0026 nothing more\n\nIf you like gore and nothing else, then you may like this. I however did like the original. This however is trash...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
