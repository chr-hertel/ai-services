Great story/script, great acting, great direction, great action. \n\nWhen I attended film classes years ago I was told that for a movie (or any story) to work you have to \"care\" about the characters, and in this movie you care about ALL the characters. Once Were Warriors should be in every film-maker students list of required movies to study just for this reason. (others on the list: Kubrick\u0027s \"The Killing\" and Robert Altman\u0027s \"MASH\")\n\nThe worst films have big budgets, big stars, big directors... but you don\u0027t care about the characters, that list is very long.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
