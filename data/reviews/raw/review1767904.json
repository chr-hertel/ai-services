The story is rather thin, but the main attractions of the movie are the fighting scenes and the style. For most of the movie the pieces fall together pretty well, although I\u0027m not too fond of David Wenham, who did his part in LotR pretty well, but just doesn\u0027t seem to be a good \"Spartan\". His voice lacks the power you\u0027d wish in a storyteller. Gerard Butler fits his role and really seems to have a good time playing Leonidas. There are a little too many slow-motion shots if you ask me, but in general the fighting scenes are awesome. It\u0027s not much of an epic movie, you can\u0027t compare it to Troy, people who expect epic and huge battles will be disappointed.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
