The opening sequence, with Fathom Harvill folding and packing her parachute, is such a welcoming montage, it sets a warm, frisky tone for the rest of the picture. A high-flying adventure with Rocky in and out of trouble--and bikinis (the lime-green one is the most tantalizing, as is Welch\u0027s entrance wearing it while coming down the steps). The running joke with different characters asking Fathom how she got her name is very amusing (\"As a child you were very...deep?\"), as is Clive Revill\u0027s fabulous comic performance as an eccentric collector who is allergic to cold weather. Beautiful locales, a wonderful score, terrific airplane-chase finale, and sunny, breezy Welch looking and acting great. Good show. ***1/2 from ****", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
