For example, in Tikoy\u0027s 1996 Segurista (Dead Sure), there\u0027s very little exposure of Michelle Aldana\u0027s silk-smooth flesh - what the viewers learn in the underlying message are the evils of poverty which drive the shrewd and pragmatic woman to flee from Pinatubo\u0027s volcanic havoc, leaving her husband and child behind, while she sleeps her way to an insurance agent\u0027s dream of success.
