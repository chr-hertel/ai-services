It is the first movie I see from this director, and I must say I used to enjoy Mark Wahlberg\u0027s acting much more in the past... He should have worked on his part through the studying of Indiana Jones\u0027 4 pictures. I couldn\u0027t believe what I was witnessing : terrible plot (just watch \"Children of the Corn\", don\u0027t bother seeing its awful ersatz \u0027The Happening\u0027. Actors are bad, the plot is boring, the action ridiculous, and actually, even the set isn\u0027t great. There is such a lack of suspense that one loses interest after two minutes (i.e. 2 out 10). I personally would have liked to see a dubbed version -in french, of course- because then it would have given an excuse for the awfully boring hours I spent at the theatre.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
