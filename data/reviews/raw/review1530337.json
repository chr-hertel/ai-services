But a few horror movies are more a psychological horror movie, and encourage you to use your imagination, and this is one of them. Sometimes you wonder if the events are real or in one of the character\u0027s mind.\n\nModern audiences accustomed to today\u0027s gorefests and special effects may be bored by the movie as it conveys the horror through lighting, shadows, sound, camera angles, the odd and creepy house, and the character\u0027s reactions. I think it works. I enjoyed the movie.\n\nAlso interesting was the character subplot where Luke liked Theodora, who liked Eleanor, who liked Dr. Markway, who had a wife who shows up later in the movie to drive the story forward. These interactions usually were understated and complemented the haunted house spookiness. But one could pick up on the characters\u0027 interests towards one another from the dialogue; and once the characters realized who-liked-who in the movie their actions towards one another changed slightly.\n\nSometimes Dr. Markway\u0027s dialogue was heavy on the explaining of the supernatural. Still, I did not have one of those moments watching the movie where I thought, \"Don\u0027t be an idiot, don\u0027t do that, or go in that room.\"" }
