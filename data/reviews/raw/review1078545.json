Need I go on? Alright... Se7en starts off nicely making it look like another day at work. Well it is, but it\u0027s the beginning of something big. Not 5min into the movie and we\u0027re introduced to the first murder scene which is a obese man with his hands tied together under the table and his face smashed into a pile of noodles. He\u0027s obviously dead. The killer in this movie picks his victims according to the seven deadly sins, which if you don\u0027t know are: greed, gluttony, lust, pride, wrath, envy, and sloth. The killer is very original in the style he kills his victims, which are often times very gruesome. Although they don\u0027t really show any killings in here just the way they implied lust was enough to turn my stomach. The movie does a great job with its dark setting and bad neighborhood. Symbolic that this city sucks and is run down. The acting by Mordan Freeman and Brad Pitt is sensational, as well as Kevin Spacy\u0027s acting, whom I praise for his role. Overall this is one of the best movies I\u0027ve ever seen, and the ending... oh buddy, the ending will getcha.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
