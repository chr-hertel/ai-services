It\u0027s about this woman, Sylvia, who inherits a family castle in Italy. The other thing I knew, was that it was a (horror) movie from 1969. I didn\u0027t even know it was directed by Amando de Ossorio, the director who also was responsible for the infamous BLIND DEAD \"quadrilogy\". If I had known this, I might have looked forward to it even more. But anyway, given the premise and the year this movie was made in, I was expecting an atmospheric Gothic Horror movie with at least a bit of gruesome or scary material in it. Well, I wasn\u0027t even halfway right. This is indeed a pathetic attempt at Gothic Horror, but the atmosphere isn\u0027t as effective as it should be and the story is uneventful and very predictable. I mean, yeah, there are a couple of scenes with red and blue lighting in some tombs underneath the castle that, when watched from a distance, vaguely look like something Mario Bava might have cooked up while he was drunk. But that\u0027s about it, as far as mood and atmosphere goes.\n\nI just don\u0027t get people that say \"It\u0027s a Euro-Horror classic\" and slap it with, for instance, 8/10. Yeah, it\u0027s an old horror movie. Yeah, it\u0027s from Europe. Does that make it automatically a decent genre-classic? If you want the answer to that, I\u0027ll just advice you to take Mario Bava\u0027s OPERAZIONE PAURA (aka KILL, BABY, KILL), and put it next to Ossorio\u0027s MALENKA and then tell me which one is the good movie and which the bad. Okay, yeah, I\u0027m getting a bit carried away here, probably because I was disappointed after seeing this Ossorio snooze-fest. FANGS OF THE LIVING DEAD is not completely without merits. Let\u0027s see The castle setting is (always) great, even if it just features people walking around in it. There\u0027s a couple of busty ladies showing cleavage. One even gets some whoopee from a whip, while chained in a dungeon. The rest of the movie has Sylvia\u0027s boyfriend discussing with the town\u0027s doctor whether or not vampires do exist. And yes, we do get to see more than a couple of fake white fangs, but no blood really. No scares, no action (and by \"action\" I don\u0027t mean stunts or fights, but just something eventful or a couple of good moments). The little background story about the great-grandma (when she was young and quite attractive) being a witch and experimenting with alchemy was about the most interesting thing about the whole plot. Someone on here even pointed out that this was a comedy of some sorts. Well sure, the version I\u0027ve seen was a pretty bad movie, but I wouldn\u0027t exactly call it a comedy. Except for that final, idiotic running-over-the-bridge gag. Man, that was so misplaced So, I guess most of the movie\u0027s humor was lost on me. Apparently, there are different versions of this movie out there. Mine was about real vampires, had a stupid joke at the end, and only ran 74 minutes. And that, for me, was long enough.\n\nI say FANGS OF THE LIVING DEAD is strictly for avid Euro Horror fans. Bad movie-lovers won\u0027t even have fun with it, because it\u0027s just not bad enough (although the acting was pretty much laughter-stirring all the time). I\u0027m not even mad I wasted my time on it, as it was part of a 9-movie box-set (called THE LIVING DEAD), and some of the other movies were more than worth it. So I\u0027m not complaining. Oh well, after all there was a witch burning at a stake and a wooden stick got driven through a vampire\u0027s heart, so if you please, you can think up an extra point just for that. But the gag at the end still remains dumb.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
