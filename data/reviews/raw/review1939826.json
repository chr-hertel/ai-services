He is a greengrocer, not even an apprentice chef. Michel Roux might well be a Masterchef, although already for 16 years he fails to get his third star. Gregg may have watched a lot of cooking being done, but no cook learns anything without practice. A Masterchef has many thousands of hours of practice and is able to take on every part of the kitchen: meat, fish, pastry, desserts. Final comment: the level of knowledge of your contestant chefs is very low. Masterchef is an entertaining program but with too much screaming in the style of \"We expect the best.Only the very best chefs will go through. And: Masterchef Gregg will judge you.\"", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
