I would say that it is better than day of the dead but not quite as good as Dawn of the Dead. I enjoyed it a lot. There is a scene where a zombie takes on a shark in a battle. I think he did this for the audience at the time during the 70\u0027s were hung up in the Jaws saga and zombie saga. It was a good battle between the two. I was amazed about how good this film really is. I was expecting it to be a decent film that was watchable but it is flat out awesome.\n\nI found it as enjoyable as Dawn of the Dead 1978. I would say that it is a great zombie film worthy of a watch. I am about to watch Zombi 3 but I think it looks like a stinker from what others are saying. So this is definitely worth a rent. Has an awesome twist at the end!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
