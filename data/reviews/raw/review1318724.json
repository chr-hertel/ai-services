While this makes it pretty different from the average Grant film, it is still highly watchable and entertaining. It\u0027s sort of like someone said \"let\u0027s just follow Cary around and watch as he gets perturbed at all the little problems that come up when you are having a house rehabbed\". Considering what a fun actor he is in the film and the great support he gets from Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the film works very well. While the film has pretty modest pretensions, it makes the most of the material. It\u0027s a great film for Cary Grant fans or for the whole family.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
