The typical behavior of the uneducated, disrespectful liberal crowd outside the 2004 RNC was embarrassing for all Americans who actually respect the law. They felt disobeying rules and warnings for their own safety was an act of protest. They had the right to continue of they cleared the streets and they failed so that got what they deserved. Dissent doesn\u0027t mean being an ass, but today\u0027s protesters think exactly that. You want to disagree and dissent, I\u0027m all for it, but be a grown up and obey the law. Otherwise, you become the type of people who don\u0027t deserve respect, attention or citizenship.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
