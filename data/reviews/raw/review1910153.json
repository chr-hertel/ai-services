So I get that some details really aren\u0027t that important. Like yes, eye color doesn\u0027t effect much so whatever. But Richard is supposed to be a big, outdoorsy, threatening looking dude. That does influence the plot, because it impacts how people react to him, fights, his interests etc. etc. Too many movie adaptations of books suck out their originality, over money, ignorance, and/or misplaced arrogance. It happened to I Am Legend, it happened to The Golden Compass, which was an ever bigger shame. Let\u0027s hope for Wizard\u0027s First Rule.\n\nUgh. So watching the first episode. And yeah, for some reason they\u0027ve made the plot and characters less original and well-rounded. It makes me sad.\n\nPS If you\u0027re going to praise this show to the skies for whatever reason, bear in mind....if all you\u0027re looking for is a little adventure, fine, but this series would have been...less irritating to types of people who really appreciated the books if it was called something else and all the names were changed etc. not to be too mean! but seriously, its like the difference between A Beautiful Mind, the book, and A Beautiful Mind, the movie. In reality, John Nash had some perceptual problems when it came to how to treat the people in his life*, although I\u0027d agree with anyone who said the part where he was brilliant was more important. The movie is good (and I\u0027m not going to be diplomatic and put this show on that level) but pretty much should have been called something else. His life really wasn\u0027t the story of a gifted, but troubled guy, whose supportive wife helped him through hard times. It was the story of a fairly selfish, troubled guy, who was a real dick but also very talented and ultimately had redeeming qualities. Even if Terry Gookkind did let them brutalize his work for money (wouldn\u0027t know) he deserves better. More people watch TV and movies then read. So yeah, if you like it good for you, but realize they\u0027re two...very, very separate works of art.\n\n*Ever heard someone complain about child support? This went beyond that. His son ended up in an orphanage because of him plus he did a lot of other not great stuff. (Read it in middle school)." }
