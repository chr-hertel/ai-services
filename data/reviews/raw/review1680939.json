First, they fly around in their flying saucers that are \"shaped like huge cigars\" (??) and fiendishly shine lights in people\u0027s faces. Second, they raise three random people from the dead, taking care not to let anyone know they are responsible for this (It could blow their cover.) The dead people, acting on the orders of the aliens, wander aimlessly around a graveyard. One of them even goes into a nearby house and horrifies a woman by walking slowly and staring at her. Finally, the aliens cleverly reveal their entire plan to a trio of snoopers who manage to find their ship (It was hidden behind a tree.) They explain to the Earthlings that they fear Earth will one day discover how to make a Solaranite bomb that will explode the sun. Then they explain to the Earthlings exactly how the Solaranite bomb works. This is why they have to destroy us before we destroy them which will ultimately prove to us that they exist... or something. But there\u0027s one thing that these highly advanced aliens didn\u0027t count on: three of the Earthlings might resist somewhat.\n\n\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" is Ed Wood\u0027s masterpiece and is considered by most to be the worst film ever made. Even Criswell couldn\u0027t have predicted the cult popularity it has gained. Bela Lugosi died shortly after filming began so the majority of his scenes are played by a look-alike who looks nothing like him. The dialogue is awkward and nonsensical, the set looks like it was borrowed from an elementary school play, and the acting makes Keanu Reeves look like Sir Lawrence Olivier. Listing all the continuity errors would take longer than the film\u0027s running time. The only thing that could have made the film worse would have been to include Dolores Fuller.\n\nAll in all, \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" is one of the most entertaining movies I\u0027ve ever seen, a triumph of will over talent.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
