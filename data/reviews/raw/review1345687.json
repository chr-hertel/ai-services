The film has never been made into a faithful version of the book because the rights to the book are in dispute.\n\nPeople who view the TV version think that they are watching a film made of the book, but they most certainly are not.The acting and directing are poor, and the sets are cheesy.\n\nRead the book, and hope that some day, a good director will be able to make the actual events in the novel come to life.\n\nMarlynn Alkins", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
