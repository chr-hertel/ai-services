A romantic comedy with an IMDb score of 6.8 is rare, so I thought I was in for a treat, but not so. Let\u0027s see what we don\u0027t get: \n\n\n* Characterisation. The male lead is an absolute blank, we don\u0027t know any more about him when the film ends than we did the moment our heroine first lays eyes on him. The female lead is the thinnest of archetypes with a sprinkling of Greek ethnicity - unhappy with her place in life longing for change (her dream is apparently to substitute her waitress job in the family business for a job as telephone travel agent in another part of the family business), which some curlers and contacts are key ingredients in providing. The respective families are as stereotypical as you could want them.\n\n\n\n* A love story. Why the happy couple are attracted to each other remains a mystery, but fair enough - love at first sight I presume. But what keeps them attracted, what do they get from each other, what do they share? Where is the passion? We don\u0027t get anything here! \n\n\n\n* A plot! Nothing happens in this film - no serious obstacles, no interesting dilemmas, no twists or surprises.\n\n\nWhat you do get is ham fisted humor, which is mostly embarrassing but made me chuckle a few times and decent acting (though it can be hard to judge as the range of emotions is really small) - worth one small star each, taking this bore from one to three small stars.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
