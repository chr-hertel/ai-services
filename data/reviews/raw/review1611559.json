Pictures thinking when they decided that Alfonso Cuarón should direct this film? First of all his well known film is Y tu mamá también, which was good with critics, but not really Harry Potter worthy if you ask me.\n\nFirst of all, the writer of the script, Steven Kloves, did not do a good job as he had with the previous films. He completely took the book and turned it into more of a Cliff Notes version of the book with leaving some important things out of the film.\n\nNow, don\u0027t get me wrong but the film is great as a movie, but as an adaption based upon the book it\u0027s horrible. It has many flaws, plot holes and worse of all the magic seems to be missing from this film. Not magic as in magic, but the presence of magic that the first two films brought into us fans of the books. Hogwarts even looked different to me.\n\nFor people who have never read the books you\u0027ll love it, but for readers of the books you may have mixed emotions as I did. I liked the film, don\u0027t get me wrong, I was just disappointed as a fan of the book. However, I have to give some credit to this film. Since I didn\u0027t completely hate it but didn\u0027t completely love it. Which is why I gave it a 5 out of 5.\n\nIt has it\u0027s issues, but only for readers of the books.\n\nLove Always \u0026 Blessed Be, Xander Trotter", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
