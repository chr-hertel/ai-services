This said, however, I was extremely disappointed with Talledega Nights. Except for a few funny moments, it was about as entertaining as the sport it made fun of. I was afraid that Ferrell might have lost his touch, but all my fears vanished as I watched Blades of Glory. It is every bit as good as Anchorman, with almost as many quotable lines. Heder and Ferrell are backed by a solid supporting cast, including SNL\u0027s Amy Poehler, Arrested Development\u0027s Will Arnett, and Jenna Fischer of The Office (USA). This film is the third in Ferrell\u0027s ongoing project of satirizing masculinity by portraying various stereotypical male icons of less than normal intelligence. I found myself laughing from the opening brawl until the final showdown, and quoting the movie with my friends for the rest of the night. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for an hour and a half of laughs in the theater and a week or more of laughs from repeating lines with your friends.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
