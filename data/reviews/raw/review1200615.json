Next after that came an interesting aspect of American history when people of any age could drive just by being taught on the spot as that boy Lucius was right after the beautiful scenery of which the film began with.It\u0027s very inspirational from start to finish \u0026 beyond the film\u0027s ending in addition to how as one good when I didn\u0027t even ever know of the film\u0027s name for 21 years in part because the story \u0026 scenery took me away so that I didn\u0027t need to know the name in order to be impressed as well as to be taken away through time \u0026 imagery \u0026 so that in conclusion when I saw the ad for this years later \u0026 there was just no mistaking that scenery for another scenery \u0026 I then watched it after the ad of which told it was coming up next \u0026 to no surprise I was right got to watching it again \u0026 now even have it on tape \u0026 feel that everyone should as well because it\u0027s very awe inspiring \u0026 as well as a very educational aspect of our American History \u0026 in addition to that knowing another work of William Faulkner\u0027s outside \"As I Lay Dying.\" of which I read in American Literature back in 1984.Watch in The Reivers for Will Geer as That grandpa called Boss and before he was made famous as Grandpa Walton.\n\nHowever If you get the copy of this movie like on the wide screen DVD with both the top and bottom black borders you may like me find it both distracting as well as unnecessary.\n\nTruthfully, Stephen \"Steve\" G.
