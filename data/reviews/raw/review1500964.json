I didn\u0027t know what to expect. I think the movie was really good. It wouldn\u0027t be my favorite choice but i wouldn\u0027t mind watching it.\n\nIt\u0027s not really a movie for people who don\u0027t like killing and blood and stuff but if you can handle that it\u0027s quite fun to watch. I think the actors did well,because it probably won\u0027t be easy tot play such a role. So to people who like watching movies with killing and blood. I recommend this movie to them. I give it a big plus! A 10 of course. So watch this movie because it\u0027s a really good one!! But watch it with subtitles because you might not speak Japanese.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
