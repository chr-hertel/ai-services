The beginning of the movie is very suspenseful, but it loses some momentum as the movie progresses. I think that the casting was very good for this movie. It seems that Ethan Hunt genuinely cares for his \"wife\" and his wife cares for him. One thing that took off 2 stars (out of 10) was the explosive charge that the enemies put in his head. I thought that this was a definite blunder. I also thought that this movie was the least realistic of the 3. When Cruise gets thrown clear of the plane crash, and hits the car, he gets right back up and runs away. Thats not realistic. At all.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
