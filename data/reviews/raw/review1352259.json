I forgot about it until I accidentally got here through another actor\u0027s name, go figure! This series was so stylish and sexy, each and every episode got better and better. I remember being so upset that it didn\u0027t survive more than one season, because the actors, especially Lisa Hartman, Jennifer Beals and Drew Barrymore, all played off of each other wonderfully. I knew nothing of the cost involved in producing the show but man, for us fans, it was definitely worth it. Aaron Spelling, if you still own this show, please release the entire series on DVD for the old fans, and for future fans to enjoy! Peace!" }
