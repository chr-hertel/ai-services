And that\u0027s really dramatic all by itself.\n\nI think On the Lot suffers from not enough \"reality\". Behind the scenes film-making is tough stuff, and I\u0027d like to have seen more of that along with the finished shorts.\n\nHowever, \"On the Lot\" is not a bad show. Garry Marshall is an oddball that throws in all kinds of jokes and then delivers a one line synopsis of why a particular film doesn\u0027t work. Sure he\u0027s goofy...but if you pay attention to those quick one line observations, you\u0027ll see why the man has made so many hits over the years.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
