Heath ledger was simply spectacular, one of the best villain roles ever played by a comic villain.This movie is very different from the other batman movies because it has a better storyline and heart-pounding action.Credit also must be given to Christian bale for his amazing performance.. but frankly speaking the joker steals the thunder..There is a whimsical turn in the ending which makes the movie one of the best of all times.. its almost perfect! RIP Heath ledger,you were BRILLIANT!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
