Completely entertaining and is just what you should watch every Halloween night!! First off, the plot. Great concept, and put into action in a fantastic way.\n\nThe voices fit the characters perfectly. Couldn\u0027t have been better. \n\nThe whole thing is candy for your eyes.\n\nAnd of course, the ending. The ending is everything in a movie. And it wrapped this wonderful little movie up perfectly.\n\nTim Burton has certainly done it again! I can\u0027t wait for more movies from him.\n\n9/10 Wonderful job.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
