And it does a decent job of educating it\u0027s viewers about the history of moon landing. Nothing too special about the storyline itself. However, the documentary provokes the beauty of life. It inspires me, as its viewer, regardless of where I am in life, what my political view is, what my religious view is, to fully appreciate the life I\u0027m living, be grateful of every moment of life, and try to enjoy and make use of every minute of it. I guess it\u0027s the significance of moon landing itself, and this documentary effectively conveys it. Very few film today brings such message these days. That\u0027s why I scored it high.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
