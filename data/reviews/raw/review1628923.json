However the plot seems to be a little silly and doesn\u0027t bring anything new to the genre. In fact, what I liked the most was definitely the corrosive humour that is really funny at parts. The kind of jokes used is the commonly used in the dark comedies (or horror comedies) but are very well conceived and are very sarcastic. Especially the Mayor character, it\u0027s excellent. But, on the other hand, the \"part\" of the movie connected to the horror is not so good (except some good gore scenes), because it is nothing special. It\u0027s just a zombies\u0027 flick with these little \"monsters\" (in this case slugs) from the outer space. I don\u0027t know but it all seemed a bit foolish to me", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
