It\u0027s cheesy, poorly directed, looks cheap, and features the same couple of bad matte paintings and special effects in each episode.\n\nActually, come to think of it, those ARE the reasons that I love this show. Plus the fact that the 25th Century is literally crawling with hot babes in skimpy space-duds!\n\nCosmic Wiz Kid stars Gary Coleman (Arnold from Diff\u0027rent Strokes) as Hieronymous Fox, a five-hundred year old child genius and president of planet Genesia, who is kidnapped and held for ransom by space criminal Roderick Zale (Ray Walston). Fox\u0027s tasty female bodyguard, Dia Cyrton (Melody Rogers, looking fetching in her tight-as-you-like orange outfit, with matching silver boots and gloves), enlists the help of Buck Rogers (Gil Gerard) to help rescue her boss. Meanwhile, Earth\u0027s sexiest star-pilot, Col. Wilma Deering (Erin Gray), goes undercover to lend a hand (and unfortunately swaps her sexy blue Spandex outfit for a much less appealing jumpsuit) .\n\nFull of all the awful elements fans have come to expect from this seriespolystyrene props, dreadful comedic moments, naff fights performed by unconvincing stunt doubles in bad wigsCosmic Wiz Kid is a fairly entertaining episode that perhaps relies a little too much on the \u0027charm\u0027 of its pint-size, chipmunk-cheeked guest-star Coleman. If, like me, you find his \u0027cute kid\u0027 act more than a little irritating, then do what I do: try and mentally blank out the annoying little pipsqueak, and then sit back and revel in the sheer crapness that is Buck Rogers\u0027 25th Century.\n\nOn offer in this episode are such rare delights as a gold-skinned psychic alien, a robot with a low opinion of organic life-forms, and a super-strong assassin who reveals that he would be considered puny on his own planet. Also, keep your eyes peeled for the following: the \u0027futuristic\u0027 computer monitor that displays nothing but coloured shapes, Wilma Deering\u0027s \u0027advanced\u0027 communication device (a box with a button), and a textbook example of the \u0027final joke/freeze frame\u0027 ending that was so common in TV series of the era (see Hart to Hart or Knight Rider for further great examples of this classic technique)." }
