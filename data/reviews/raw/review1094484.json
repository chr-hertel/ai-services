The inhabitants of Royston Vasey head into \u0027our\u0027 world to persuade the writers not to stop writing about them and thus destroy their world.\n\nIf that sounds a bit too serious, don\u0027t be put off. Within the first few minutes we get: Bernice (the vile female vicar) letting rip at an unfortunate penitent during confession; Chinnery (the vet who inadvertently destroys every animal he touches) attempting to collect semen from a giraffe; Mickey (thick beyond belief) being, ah, thick; and Tubbs (inbred sister-wife and local shopkeeper) being sweet as ever - but still disgusting.\n\nSome of the regular characters are missing, but a new idea by the Gents introduces some 16th-Century characters - and we have the Gents themselves in the action too. If you\u0027re new to The League of Gentlemen, this is an easy introduction and a lot of fun. If you\u0027re a long-standing fan, this has everything you\u0027ve come to expect - including the joys of Jeremy Dyson spotting.\n\nAll told, it\u0027s got the same faintly surreal humour that\u0027s the hallmark of the series, plus some moments of quite touching \u0027introspection\u0027. Herr Lipp, for example, maintains a gentle dignity on learning that he\u0027s regarded by his creators as a \u0027one-joke character\u0027. While most of the characters stay as they are, some develop in unexpected ways that are perfectly natural when they happen.\n\nThis film is a \u0027swan song\u0027 for Royston Vasey, but it\u0027s also a showcase for the Gents who prove that (gasp!) they can write other stuff - and it can be very funny. (But you knew that anyway.)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
