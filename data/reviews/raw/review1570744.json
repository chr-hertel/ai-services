I am a huge Batfink fan and I am also the proud owner of the 4 Disc complete box set. The stories can be a bit repetitive but it totally funny! Batfink along with his wings of steel and his super sonic sonar radar helps to foils the plots of mad scientist Hugo A-Go-Go along with other zany villains. With the help of Karate, his strong but simple right hand man, the bumbling Chief of Police and the inquisitive hidden programme narrator, he\u0027s saves the day in the end! This cartoon was produced in the late 1960\u0027s but was so popular it continued to aired throughout the 1970\u0027s and into the 1980\u0027s until it was cancelled in around 1988! Vanished completely during the 1990\u0027s, it made an incredible T.V comeback in 2004 and again is become a huge part of a child\u0027s life in the mid to late 2000\u0027s! You should show it too your kids and they will start to introduce it to their generation because Batfink just plain rules! \"Your bullets cannot harm me, my wings are like a shield of steel!\" 10/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
