It\u0027s fun, it\u0027s beautiful and you can feel the true joy of life in this film. Sabina is so beautiful and it\u0027s a liberation to see how Stephane slowly becomes a part of their life style and slowly understands that women dancing and cheering to the music is part of their life. I often listen to Balkan music and music like Cumbia one of the best parts is listening to the people in the background cheering and singing along! It\u0027s hard to come by - but I found it on amazon and it made my day :) Kustarica is good - but this is great! My favorite scene is towards the end where Stephane and Sabina goes to \"the city\" to party and they start to play a wedding-like song and they start to crash porcelain on the floor - by then Stephane has become a true convert to Roman :D", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
