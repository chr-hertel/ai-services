Plus, I felt as if movies with very similar plot lines had been done quite recently (Troy, Alexander, etc.), and none had fared particularly well. This seemed like a B-list version of one of those movies.\n\nI\u0027m not quite sure why I decided to see the movie, when it got mediocre reviews and had a misleading preview. But one day when I was sick, I decided to rent it, hoping it would distract me from being ill.\n\nTo say the least, this movie was a lot better than I had expected. Sure, the accents weren\u0027t exactly up to par, and the dialog was clunky, and the \"love\" between Tristan (James Franco) and Isolde (Sophia Myles) seemed more like lust, I still really liked it. I thought the two main actors had great chemistry, and the action sequences were well done. It won\u0027t win any awards, but I thought that the title relationship in the movie was believable. At the least, the movie was an above average action/romance flick with pretty stars. And there\u0027s always James Franco\u0027s brooding good looks.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
