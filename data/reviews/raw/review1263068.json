This film so encapsulates the decades I grew up in. The stereotypes portrayed remain true to this day. The cops are corrupt, the racists are ignorant and the true believers in true freedom are overwhelmed in the end... sigh. Some things never change, my friends. Read Edward Abbey for further insight to this spectacularly polished and perfect low-budget movie. The film \"Lonely are the Brave\", starring a very young Kirk Douglas and and even younger Walter Matthau is a close parallel in gorgeous black and white. It is based on \"The Last Cowboy\" by Abbey, but his masterpiece \"A Fools Progress\" illustrates -almost as completely as \"Vanishing Point\"- the heartbreaking philosophy that mourns the final death of true freedom in the one Empire that claimed to champion it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
