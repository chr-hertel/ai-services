What A Load Of Steaming Crud!", "reviewBody": "What starts as a cheap Misery rip-off soon deteriorates into a pointless and slow-moving telemovie with teenage tearaways jumping out of cupboards.\n\nAfter Alex McArthur is kidnapped and presented with pickled appendages by insane sisters Vanessa and Ann, Alex returns home to search for the retina-challenged incestuous spawn of Vanessa. With her troubled, spotty son causing raccoon-torturing incidents, Alex becomes a little too involved in a twisted family album. (What we have written here would imply a far greater film than the one that we actually viewed) Despite this, one really has to give credit to the wardrobe department on this one, making a 2001 production really have that eighties look about it. Laura Esterman\u0027s beautiful wig-work is also a point of interest for water-cooler discussion. (Can\u0027t even figure out why it was appropriate for her to be wearing a wig) If it\u0027s confusing and pointless drivel you\u0027re after, then look no further than Suspended Animation - aka the more generically-titled Mayhem. Don\u0027t expect scares or entertainment from this film, rather confusion caused by the fact that you are 38 minutes into the film with no end in sight.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
