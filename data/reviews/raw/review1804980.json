I guess I am getting old, since I\u0027ve been a fan of Tim Burton\u0027s for a while as well.\n\nEven though I loved Pee Wee \u0026 Big Fish, The best of Tim Brton\u0027s films are those that star Johnny Depp. Sweeney Todd might be their best. Not being a fan of musicals had a little affect of what I thought of this movie. The music works, the actors are excellent, \u0026 Burton once again takes you to another world, \u0026 makes you become a resident for 2 hours. This is what movie making is all about. Leaving the theater, I thought, first I can\u0027t wait to see this again on DVD, and second, what will these two do next.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
