SE tells the story of a professor, a psychic,a student and a filmmaker that trap themselves in an abandoned hospital to record any paranormal activity,then they find out that the hospital is nothing but a gateway to hell, all of this made like a documentary(what we are watching is the tape that the police found in the hospital, the only thing they found). The reasons this movie change my life:1)it was made maybe with the budget of a \"fast food\" employee salary check, and still it is amazing how good and scary this movie came to be 2) the actors,once the movie start you know, are no career actors and still their performances are convincing to the point when you see them as real people(this thanks to the documentary effect as well) and 3) well, you have to give yourself to this movie and consider this things in mind before watching,THIS IS A VERY LOW BUDGET PICTURE so don\u0027t expect amazing visual effects or famous Oscar-winning faces and you have to watch it with the proper atmosphere, a dark room with the least noise possible.The \"documentary technique\" , the one that make a classic out of Nigth of the Living Dead and was exploited in the Blair Witch Prject is used here very efficiently. But don\u0027t take my word for it, watch it yourself and kill your cow.\n\nFavorite scene: The Ax-man in the hall. hair rising.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
