It\u0027s a classic tale of the \"wrong man\" who may or may not be responsible for the disappearance of his wife. Here, instead of Harrison Ford (this also reminds me of \"Frantic\"), we get a younger, taller version of Dustin Hoffman - the resemblance is uncanny. But he\u0027s a good actor, and so is the ensemble cast that appears in this movie.\n\nThere\u0027s suspense, tension, action, everything. It\u0027s very rare that I applaud a movie, let alone a scene in a movie. Well, \"Tell No One\" has one scene (I won\u0027t say which, but it\u0027s in the middle of the film) that made me get up and do that, and when a movie makes me do this, well, that\u0027s a very good sign.\n\nThe mystery is great until you find out what really happened. The third act ruins all the fun. It\u0027s too unbelievable, too complicated, too convoluted. It seems like all the effort went in the first two acts, and the third was almost like an afterthought.\n\nSo, this is a thriller, a mystery, and an action movie. And a good one at all that. It\u0027s a shame that the \u0027d√©nouement\u0027 is so bad, because the movie makes big promises, but in the end, it all just fizzles out. Oh and the plot holes. Don\u0027t get me started on that.\n\nBut hey, don\u0027t listen to me. Watch this movie if you\u0027re interested - I loved it up until the ending, so who knows, you might like it, and it\u0027s a well-made effort. But I\u0027m sticking to Hitch.\n\n6/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
