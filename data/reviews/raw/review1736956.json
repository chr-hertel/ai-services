It seems that by this point, they\u0027d gone on just about every adventure possible, so what more could they do? Truth is, I always considered \"The Voyage Home\" their most cerebral movie and got the feeling that there couldn\u0027t be anything better in their franchise.\n\nStill, I can\u0027t deny that there are some neat scenes (especially the Gilbert and Sullivan stuff). Reprising their roles are Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiner, Jonathan Frakes and LeVar Burton, while the new character here is F. Murray Abraham. Worth seeing maybe once.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
