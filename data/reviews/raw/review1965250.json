The grown up Buddy who appears at the end of the movie was MAYBE in his early to mid 30\u0027s. In reality, he\u0027d have actually been about 20 years older. Other than that, cute movie coming from a Southerner. Usually, Im picky about movies taking place in the South. For example, I hated Julia Roberts fake accent in Steel Magnolias. It irritated me because she IS from the South, and STILL found it necessary to over exaggerate a Southern Accent. Overall, cute movie. Didn\u0027t even know it existed until I walked in on my mother watching it. Laura and Diane (real life mother \u0026 daughter) are cute in it together.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
