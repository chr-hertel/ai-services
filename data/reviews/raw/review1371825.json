Of all the episodes I\u0027ve seen so far, \"Jenifer\" has the thinnest and most predictable plot, yet this is widely compensated by the amount of graphic sex, violence and pure perversion! The subject matter isn\u0027t anything like what Dario Argento usually brings to the screen (no elegant giallo-murders or anything...) but his stylish trademarks are definitely represented in \"Jenifer\", for example through the creepy and genuinely weird atmosphere and the petrifying music (by \"Goblin\" band-member Claudio Simonetti). The story follows police officer Frank Spivey who becomes obsessed with a young girl he saved by a narrow margin from getting killed by a deranged psychopath. The poor girl, who has a lovely body but a horribly deformed face, can\u0027t talk and Frank decides to take her home with him. After his wife and son left him, Frank quickly learns that Jenifer has an insatiable sex hunger but also some very disturbing eating habits... It\u0027s almost praiseworthy how Dario Argento cleverly avoids explaining all the improbabilities in story and simply keeps you entertained by lurching from one gory set piece to another. Where does Jenifer originally come from? Are none of the murdered people ever missed? The truth is you don\u0027t really care as long as the shocks are genuine and the gore is luscious! It takes a great filmmaker to get away with this kind of gigantic holes in the script, but Argento surely is one! The sex sequences are amazingly filmed, since they combine feelings of both excitement and disgust. Sick little film, I loved it!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
