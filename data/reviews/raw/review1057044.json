Primarily modeled on three stories from Frank Miller\u0027s graphic novels, the film brings together so many elements which leaves the audience breathless... and wanting more. There\u0027s sex, violence, revenge, kindness and anger all shot BEAUTIFULLY by Robert Rodriquez following the rampant pace and dialogue of Miller\u0027s work. \n\nWhen I first saw the cast list for this movie I was excited and worried; normally when this many stars are brought together the results are disappointing, but the most disappointing part of this film is having to leave this incredible world and these wonderful characters. It is so clich√© to say it but it is as guilty a pleasure as watching a car wreck; the audience is so captivated by the gore and brutality and pure aesthetic perfection that it cannot walk away. If you are bored by or just interested in leaving your everyday existence, then I recommend you take a trip to Sin City, you may be surprised by how much you like it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
