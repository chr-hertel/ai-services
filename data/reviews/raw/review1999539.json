OK at times and irritating during others Jia Khan is unnoticeable.\n\nSongs are just randomly strewn and not good.\n\nMovie is just too long. Typical, steal the idea from Mememto but thrown in enough masala \u0026 the occasional international location to make it a commercial bollywood flick.\n\nIt\u0027s a Hindi movie but has a very over-acting South Indian touch which again is coming from the director A nice story was wasted with the usual bollywood drama and horrible direction.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
