She is the quintessential westernwoman; the woman every man who would ever intentionally watch a western, didn\u0027t know it was possible to dream of. \n\nSometimes I may forget her for a day or two, but I have a picture of her on my refrigerator and she\u0027s been with me for 3-4 years now. \n\nAnd such is the entire movie; as Nietzsche ended western metaphysics, Sergio Leone effectively ended the western genre. \n\n9/10 for the movie - plus that 1 extra just for Claudia \u003d 10/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
