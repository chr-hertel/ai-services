The good, the bad, the ugly of them. Everything from Underworld to the original Dracula featuring the one and only Bela...So when I found this in a bin for only $5.50, I thought SWEET!!! A new vampire movie for about the same price as a rental.\n\nNow.....all I can say is that I want my $5.50 back with INTEREST. I would have given the movie a ZERO instead of a one, but there wasn\u0027t that option. Don\u0027t waste your time or your money...Even if you have the flu and can\u0027t get out of the house and it is the only thing you can find on some obscure cable program....Don\u0027t do it. You\u0027ll CRY when you watch it because you can actually feel your brain cells dying and shriveling up.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
