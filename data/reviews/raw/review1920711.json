Polanski\u0027s work here is certainly promising, in particular his use of off-screen space. The atmosphere is successfully claustrophobic and the film has a lot on its mind regarding Communism, social classes, and basic human and sexual nature. The jazzy score fits the film and was very good (although it caused my neighbors to enter my apartment thinking they would catch me watching porn). The film would have worked better as a thirty, forty minute short as the characters are not interesting enough to justify a 94-minute running time. The film may not have deserved the exuberant attention it received but it is an interesting piece of pure cinema, certainly worth seeing.\n\n7/10" }
