Same message, same innocence and trip.\n\nThe story of David is picture of a brutal time. I saw looking this film, not only for the location of action, moments of blessed father Vincent Eugene Bossilkoff, a Bulgarian member of Congregation of the Passion, martyred on November 11, 1952 by Communist regime. I saw the shadow of a hated era and forms of resistance against the evil.\n\nMaybe, this film is a masterpiece. Or a boring show about strange gestures and facts. For \"free world\", the crimes of East Europe are, in fact, only form of fiction. In essence, in the deep of souls of many people, the Communism is not ghost, traumatic event or sadistic game. Like butchers or victims, it is a eternal illness. Dust in blood\u0027s composition, memories of weak power and fear.\n\nSo, Ben Tibber\u0027s character is not a boy with a great mission but the face of purity in an ugly time." }
