Of course, if you are easily offended, then you shouldn\u0027t be seeing this movie.\n\nIt\u0027s nice to see that writer-director Kevin Smith seems to have found his touch again. After the disastrous \"Jersey Girl\" (2004), which might easily rank as one of the worst films of the decade, Smith fell back to doing something he was sure of - recreating the antics and philosophical musings of Dane (Brian O\u0027Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson), who are still working at the convenience store and adjoining video store all these many years later.\n\nLike many of Smith\u0027s comedies, \"Clerks II\" is a hit-or-miss movie. But the thing about Smith is that his jokes hit more often than they miss, \"Jersey Girl\" notwithstanding.\n\nIf you\u0027re a fan of Smith\u0027s brand of humor, there\u0027s much to enjoy here. There are several raunchy jokes that are truly funny. And then there\u0027s Randal\u0027s diatribe against \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy that has to be seen to be believed.\n\nYou don\u0027t go to Smith\u0027s movies for the performances. But there\u0027s something charming about watching O\u0027Halloran and Anderson riff off each other like two real friends who\u0027ve always been together. Rosario Dawson brings a sufficient amount of spunk to her Becky, though Smith might want consider not casting his wife next time.\n\nYes, we have to sit through a cameo by Ben Affleck, but how can you not like a film that has given us Pillow Pants?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
