And if you regard this performance by Billy Bob Thornton, compared with his in \"Bad Santa\" and \"Sling Blade\" - and think for a moment of these three diverse characters - can there be any doubt that this man is as fine an actor as one is likely to encounter?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
