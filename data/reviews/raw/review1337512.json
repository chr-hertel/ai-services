Whoever said that either never saw Tremors or should never be allowed to write a review again. This movie jumps from place to place with no apparent idea. Is it a comedy or a horror? truth is the creator probably doesn\u0027t know. The only times it makes you laugh are when it is so stupid that it is funny, and then your not even sure that you are supposed to be laughing. Besides that it is disturbing and graphic. I think that the person who made this movie should make another movie, \"How to fail at movie-making\" or \"what not to do\" -1000 stars.\n\n-sidenote, the opening that they stole from the movie. The Blob made in the 50\u0027s without fancy special effects and was way better. If you have any urge to watch slither go rent The Blob.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
