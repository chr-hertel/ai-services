THAT is why the ratings were poor. I know that NBC did the same to Seinfeld and when it finally brought it back into a solid time slot where people could get to know it, it caught on.\n\nUnfortunately Fox\u0027s idiocy with this program led to its demise. I have watched all the episodes on DVD and cannot believe the number I\u0027d never seen before because I could not follow this show around the various time slots and half the time it wasn\u0027t on. Fox screwed with this show\u0027s scheduling so much it never had a chance to gain momentum but anyone I know who is a fan is a RABID fan because the show is off the charts brilliant, the writing excellent, the performances stellar and the narration by Ron Howard is hilarious.\n\nIt\u0027s hard to write a review of this show without using the word brilliant for all the writing and all the acting. Jason Bateman is stunningly brilliant as Michael Bluth. Who ever knew he was so talented? His performance is nuanced and funny and he has mastered the art of facial reaction. But he is surrounded by a cast that was undeniably the best comedy ensemble on television the past few years. Jeffrey Tambor\u003dbrilliant, David Cross\u003dbrilliant, Will Arnett\u003dbrilliant, Tony Hale\u003dbrilliant, Jessica Walter\u003dbrilliant...guest stars Ed Begley Jr, Liza Minnelli, Henry Winkler, etc etc etc...\u003d brilliant.\n\nI honestly do not use these superlatives that often but it\u0027s such a rare and incredible comedy. The pace is fast and furious and there are so many throw away lines that you have to watch each episode 3 or 4 times to get them all. There are so many small details in every scene that you have to really watch for different things. The way they set up the farces is just the funniest thing.\n\nAnd Fox canceled it.\n\nIt was truly one of the brightest spots in all of television history and I hope that one of the cable channels picks it up because it is great. Definitely buy the DVDs and watch it over and over and over again." }
