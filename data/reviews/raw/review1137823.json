As soon as I heard Tom\u0027s voice I knew who it was. My mother took all three of us children to the live broadcast on several occasions. And Mother wore her hats, always wore a hat and gloves back then. I think you\u0027d need to be of the proper era to appreciate it, and a lot of the other old time movies, as well. The war years were a time unto themselves, and I don\u0027t know how this generation could relate well enough to appreciate the nation\u0027s, and the world\u0027s, philosophies and attitudes of that time.\n\nThis movie is a warm fuzzy for us older folks.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
