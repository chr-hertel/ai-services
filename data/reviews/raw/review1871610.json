The plot etc. Loved almost every role that all portrayed. But i missed the very start as i was late viewing this brilliant fun drama. Its a great production in its own rite as \"trainspotters and lovers\" will find a soft spot for, as \"Gus and Natalie\" go thru the days, there romance blossoms ... \n\nWorth seeing if you can get the chance but I\u0027ve never seen a repeat of this amazing film.... Hope 1 day will come when there\u0027s a DVD out soon ... please let me know if there is :-) its \"bostin\".\n\nLove Glyn (Pardoe) From Dudley in the Black Country", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
