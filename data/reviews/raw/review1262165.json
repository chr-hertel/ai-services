You see that was the time that Mr Dressup aired. He was always there with a new story or a new idea, or just all around fun. It inspired me to be imaginative. It inspired me to be creative and not just plod through life. It taught me that you can make up your own friends and have them live in trees. It taught me everything.\n\nI will miss him very much. Everyone in Canada, who grew up with a TV will. I am glad that CBC still shows it, so I can hopefully show my Children this show. \n\nRIP Mr Dressup." }
