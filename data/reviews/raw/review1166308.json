Whenever I see Rex I become home-sick. I know all the places where the series where shot and the people are real Austrians. Their behavior, their WURSTSEMMEL (this is the bread Rex ant the policemen always eat), their cars,..... it\u0027s all sooo real. \n\nI wish I could see it in my mother-tongue but so far I wasn\u0027t lucky. I\u0027ve seen it in dutch and Spanish so far and it makes me laugh how they spell the austrian names. \n\nI\u0027m glad this series was such a success that I can watch it almost anywhere in the world. Also in the Dominican Republic where I will live in the near future.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
