It was so funny!!!!! I don\u0027t even know where to start. The people who didn\u0027t enjoy this movie have no clue. They CANNOT appreciate a masterpiece when they see it and should stick to seeing movies with lots of action to keep their brains stimulated. It is not boring at all. I couldn\u0027t get enough of it! The acting was superb because it was so real without all the unnecessary drama of today\u0027s mega stars. They don\u0027t make many movies like this nowadays and its a real shame. I am getting sick and tired of all the sex, shooting, blowing things up and crazy stunts that most movies need today to make a profit. Kudos for ND! Are you gonna eat those tots??" }
