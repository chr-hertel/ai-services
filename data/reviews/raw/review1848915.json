There\u0027s no point in it either then blood and violence. Unlike other scary movies that had gore and a meaning to it this movie is just blood, gore, and killing one after another. This movie isn\u0027t interesting at all, has no meaningful plot or story line, nor does it have an intelligence in it. The blood looks very fake and this movie overall, is pointless. Don\u0027t even waste your time with it. It\u0027s just an hour or two of mindless violence. It has many bloody scenes that aren\u0027t scary but just plain revolting. This is probably the worst horror film I have ever watched out of all the horror films I ever saw.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
