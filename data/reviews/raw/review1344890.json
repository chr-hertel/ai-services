It is not related to the original in storyline.It is also a much shorter game.The character control is by all means exceptional, but not as fast as the first Unreal.The weapons are excellent as well.\n\nThere is a Multiplayer add-on available called XMP. XMP is one of the most fun multi-player modes in all of FPS. It is a class-based team game.There are 3 classes of character to chose, all with their own unique abilities. There are 3 vehicles with weapons mounted on them.You can run people over of course! There are also fixed turrets to defend with, and the Tech can lay auto-turrets. The weapons and sheer destruction in XMP make it a definite must see for any FPS fan. Bear in mind it is a bit complicated to get running, due to ZERO support by Epic.You will need to research a little to find out what files you need.BeyondUnreal\u0027s website has all the info." }
