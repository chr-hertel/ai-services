Putting aside the fact that it starts off with the stupidest and most pointless 5-10 minutes of opening sequence that I\u0027ve witnessed in a long time, it\u0027s quite dark and even pretty creepy towards the end. The acting isn\u0027t that good, but it\u0027s passable at least, and nothing to complain about. The directing is quite good and dark, and the scenery is fitting and rather good. I like how this movie doesn\u0027t really try to sugar coat the characters, as they all feel pretty real, human. I found myself almost disliking them at first, but hell, humans have flaws, and this movie doesn\u0027t hide that fact. Very well done in that department.\n\nThe plot is meaty and dense, with a nice mystery element. It\u0027s hard to tell exactly who the killer is until the very end. However, the cops in this movie don\u0027t seem very competent, as they don\u0027t really do anything except accuse Addison and pester his son, not really making an effort to find any other suspects. Iffy. I can say that plot holes are the main issue here, and the ending was pretty lame. And it really bugged me how many times the perception of the killer changes. One minute, it\u0027s him---no, him---now him! And now it\u0027s her! Ridiculous. At least they put a lot of thought into it.\n\nI\u0027ll recommend this to fans of detective thrillers, though. It\u0027s not nearly as bad as people make it out to be.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
