It\u0027s a really thought-provoking movie, that makes u addicted..You cant get your eyes off the screen because action clues are everywhere. and There are so many scenes that u have to watch over and over again to get any idea of the main questions...\n\nEveryday i meet with some of my friends and these days our main issue is \"Lost\".. We discuss about the details,theories and and characters.\n\nThe quality of the movie is also excellent. You can find yourself inside the movie while watching and the director really gives u that feeling. \n\nThats the best TV-series that i have ever seen.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
