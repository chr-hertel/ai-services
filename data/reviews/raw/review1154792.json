When I saw the title and read the text on the back of the cover, I thought it could be a real good movie... because I know the butterfly-effect and chaos theory... I just should have kept one thought in mind and that is that Hollywood cannot make real good movies about high intellectual subjects... it\u0027s just another coat for the same images over and over again... nothing new to see... Really... I stopped this movie on my player to write this comment... and I\u0027m not going to watch it further, but I\u0027ll sell it to somebody who is stupid enough to think he\u0027s smart because he watches another dumb movie with only an interesting title.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
