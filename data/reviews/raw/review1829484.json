I could not have been more wrong.\n\nThe film is both moving and uplifting, with some fantastic performances from Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. The supporting cast is equally as good, with the whole ensemble taking you on a journey of true romance.\n\nBe prepared to cry at some genuinely heartbreaking moments and have your breath taken away by some very intense love scenes.\n\nIt\u0027s hard not to say more without detracting from the film\u0027s core storyline, so I will leave it too other viewers to watch the film and surmise their own feelings...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
