I feel fortunate to have learned from him. In all too many homes, Mr. Rogers was and is the only voice of understanding, gentleness and positive reinforcement. Imagine how different our world would be if more young people could be exposed to his philosophy of acceptance and love.\n\nThere are so many children who never hear their parents say the words \"I love you\" - not once, not ever. And then they hear Mr. Rogers sing of all the ways people say \"I love you,\" like \"the cooking way\" and \"the eating way,\" and it\u0027s a comfort and reassurance beyond words. No other public figure provides this kind of life-changing insight to the people most in need.\n\nOn behalf of everyone you helped, of all the souls you touched in a badly damaged world, Mr. Rogers - we thank you, and we love you.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
