This show has 13 episodes for the first series/season, And they get better as you go along.\n\nStoryline is full of twists and for the first time in years you see things that you don\u0027t expect to happen with a sci-fi story line. Battlestar galactica has sci-fi fans glued to BBS boards and chatrooms constantly demanding and hoping for more episodes and discussing every detail of the show and trying to predict what will happen in future episodes.\n\nOne of the better sci-fi shows if you can get over the fact the show is a re-imagining and not a re-making of the original show." }
