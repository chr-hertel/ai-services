The trailer portrayed a dull teen slasher with little imagination, and derivative of just about everything else out there. Safe to say I wasn\u0027t inspired to view it. However, after a friend advised that the trailer nowhere near does the full film justice, I thought I\u0027d give it a whirl.\n\nThe story here is that after generations of inbreeding (Quite why, no one knows), 3 deformed forestfolk have essentially become cannibals and feed by stopping passing cars via planting barbed wire on the road.\n\nMuch like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre they kill not for killing\u0027s sake, but to feed - it\u0027s how they survive.\n\nHowever, Wrong Turn takes echoes from Deliverance when a group of teens get stranded via afforementioned method, and find themselves struggling to stay alive after stumbling on the cannibals\u0027 den and mistakenly alerting them to their presence.\n\nEliza Dushku and Desmond Harrington star as Jessie and Chris, initial strangers brought together by the nightmare they end up in. Jessie\u0027s in a party of 5 including herself, and Chris was on his way to a job interview. After smashing into their stranded car, Chris joins the group searching for a working phone.\n\nNeedless to say, much slicing and dicing occurs before this one is over.\n\nA surprisingly decent job was done with this movie. Sure, it\u0027s not going to win any awards for originality, the script\u0027s hardly inspired, and the acting is hardly Oscar level, but what it does it does fairly well.\n\nThe direction in particular is quite excellent. It\u0027s fast paced, it\u0027s thrilling, and it\u0027s extremely smooth. Arguably there\u0027s a bit of a missed opportunity with the cinematography as there are chances for epic panoramas which are never taken properly, but aside from this the movie\u0027s technically sound.\n\nAnother major bonus is the surprisingly effective tension created, particularly in the killers\u0027 den. Without spoiling anything, they make good villains, and their pursuit of the group works pretty well.\n\nCertainly it requires a major suspension of disbelief at many moments, and in fact comes across as downright silly at others, but nevertheless it still entertains, which is what it\u0027s supposed to do.\n\nThe plot\u0027s not exactly got a lot going for it, but it doesn\u0027t really need to. It\u0027s a simple survival horror story which relies on style over substance but succeeds in this not being to its detriment.\n\nDecent.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
