I find the pranks that the kids think of very interesting but they are not very good actors and there are only a few very good episodes. I would suggest only watching this show when there is nothing else on or you are very bored because you won\u0027t be totally bored while watching this show. You probably wouldn\u0027t want to watch an episode more than once because you already know what is going to happen. The best part of the show is seeing the result of the prank and the reactions of the people being pranked. Overall, I give this show a six out of ten. I would recommend this show for kids 12 and under because my sister is 11 and still enjoys this show. I will watch it with her from time to time but i wouldn\u0027t recommend it for someone like me because i don\u0027t watch TV very often and this isn\u0027t one of those really good shows.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
