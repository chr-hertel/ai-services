Flippin awesome!!! I recommend it to all horror movie lovers!!!! It\u0027s hard to get me scared from a movie, but this scared me to death!!! I loved it so much! Although, i\u0027m not too sure if i ever want to go caving now. But this movie was still awesome!!! I loved it! Loved it loved it! And i am a huge horror movie lover! I love the graphics in the movie. It seemed so real! Really really scary, and really really awesome. I\u0027m going to buy this movie, and watch it with my friends, cause i know they\u0027d love it. This movie i do not recommend for children under 14. Cause it is very scary. I had to cover up with the blanket during most of the movie. But it was awesome!! If you get scared easily from freaky looking things, lots of blood, and things popping out at you, this may not be the right movie for you. But if you do. This is the best movie you could ever possibly see!!! In recommend it big time. Real thriller, and i love the fact that you feel like you\u0027re actually there. :) Awesome movie! They did a great job making it! I would like to see more.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
