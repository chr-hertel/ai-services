I had heard that Warren Zevon was in this pic (his only appearance outside of documentaries, as far as I know) but was disappointed he had a fairly bit part as Babcock.\n\nI am a fan of Zevon\u0027s work (in fact, here in London, Ontario, Canada our baseball team is The Werewolves and their mascot is Warren Z. Von, which is a great source of pride to me) but, quite frankly, I didn\u0027t really pay attention to this movie. I found the plot to be very plodding, the characters to be very shallow, and the dialogue very monotonous. In the end, the only thing that kept this movie from getting a 1 from me was that Zevon was in it.\n\nI\u0027m not saying don\u0027t watch this movie just because I didn\u0027t like it, but I will say that if you are looking for a more traditional western, with gunfights and standoffs, then you will probably be disappointed.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
