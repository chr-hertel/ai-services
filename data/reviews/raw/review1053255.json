I had never heard of Sin City before but caught the movie trailer over Easter weekend and thought it look good.\n\nWow what a surprise, Micky Rourke was SO GOOD in this movie. It made me remember way I used to like him back in the 80\u0027s. What a great performance.\n\nAlthough some of the volience did make me turn my head a couple of times, I still would highly recommended this movie, if for no other reason then to watch Micky Rourke.\n\nCheck out the great way he walks. He\u0027s to COOOOOOOOL!\n\nGO SEE THIS MOVIE", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
