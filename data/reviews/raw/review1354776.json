There are a lot of stories kids wouldn\u0027t have ever known about had it not been for Keeshan (and later Warner) bringing them to our TV each Saturday morning. Some that come to mind include the boy whose friends made him eat worms in order to get a new bike and a boy who ate so many chocolate chip cookies he woke up one morning with chocolate spots all over him. I would love to see this show updated for the kids of today. Maybe blend a little CGI in there for effect. Not many things make me want to be 12 again but this show is definitely one of them." }
