After the creative holding action of \"Room Service,\" the Brothers began their creative decline in their first MGM film after the death of famed producer Irving Thalberg. I doubt this film would have been made had Thalberg been alive. Thalberg understood one essential thing about the Marx Brothers: They were masters of destruction, and, for that matter, deconstruction. Who wants to see them save a circus? We want to see them to destroy a circus, the same way they destroyed the opera. Now MGM was doing to the Marx Brothers what they had done to the Little Rascals. When Hal Roach produced the Little Rascals, they were children dealing with the concerns of children. When MGM started producing the series, they dealt with more adult concerns, and were always having to figure out a way to save the farm. That\u0027s what\u0027s happening here. Now the Marx Brothers, instead of being comic anarchists, have to save things throughout the rest of their MGM career, whether it be the circus, the gold mine or the department store. Granted, the Marx Brothers saved the sanitarium in \"At The Races,\" but they deconstructed the pomposity of medicine in the process.\n\n\"At The Circus\" is probably my least favorite Marx Brothers film -- discounting, of course, the sad abominations of \"Love Happy\" and \"The Story of Mankind.\" I blame most of my dislike on Kenny Baker, whom I find to be the most annoying straight lead of the Marx Brothers films, especially when he\u0027s singing \"Two Blind Loves.\" Granted, Tony Martin\u0027s \"Tenement Symphony\" in \"The Big Store\" is ear-grating, but not at least Martin is more personable.\n\nAs would be expected, there are some amusing moments. Groucho gets to sing his signature number \"Lydia The Tattooed Lady,\" and his scenes with Margaret Dumont still resonant, but much of the interplay between the Brothers themselves fails to click. The scene with Chico refusing to allow Groucho on the train is but a pale shadow of the swordfish scene in \"Horsefeathers.\" The cigar scene with the midget and the scene with Chico and Harpo searching Goliath\u0027s room also amuse, but there is little else. The big circus finale is forced and too reliant on trick shots.\n\nOkay, Okay, I know I am being a little hard on this film, but, to me, it represents the beginning of the end of the Marx Brothers." }
