This is the first movie I watched for 5 minutes and left because it was so terrible. I would be embarrassed to be an extra in this movie. If i were any person that participated in this film I would consider lying low for a while because they would be wanted for ruining film. I would watch Good Burger everyday for a month before I would sit through this movie. I mean how are you supposed to make a comedy that spoofs comedies even if they are romantic ones. Random crap that does not add up and even make a hint of humor, just pure stupidity, script writing, and a dumb studio to approve this film. Any Lindsay Lohan, The Olsen Twins, and Hilary Duff movie could win an Oscar before I would laugh at this movie. BOTTOM LINE....WASTE TO PAY TO SEE, WASTE TO DOWNLOAD,WASTE TO SIT THROUGH.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
