Jean Epstein made some rather significant changes to the story, but as a movie it all works very well.\n\nThe story changes the central relationship between Roderick and Madeline, and in so doing discards some of Poe\u0027s themes, but adds some new ones of its own. Likewise there are other differences as the story unfolds, but Epstein had his own consistent conception of the possibilities in the story, so that it\u0027s neither better nor worse than Poe\u0027s idea, just different - they are both creative and fascinating conceptions in their own way.\n\nThe settings and visual effects are very effective in establishing the atmosphere, and in setting off some of the themes of the story. Some of them, such as the enormous array of flickering candles by which Roderick works, are used as recurring images, with surprisingly haunting results. The pace with which the images come at the viewer is also used as part of the effect. It\u0027s quite a distinctive accomplishment, and it\u0027s a movie that you won\u0027t forget for a while." }
