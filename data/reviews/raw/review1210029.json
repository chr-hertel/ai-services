The first dealing with a totally \u002780\u0027s Lois Ayres all punked out with a superb Mohawk going on (some people not as prone to loving the 1980\u0027s as me may think that\u0027s a detriment, whereas I dug it). She\u0027s topless sunbathing while her family\u0027s away. Jamie Gillis and Dan T. Mann are street cop looking for a Perp when they stumble onto Lois, sooner than you can say threesome, they are participating in just that. The scene was very hot. The next scene featuring Gina Carrera and Jacqueline Lorians as roommates who share more then toothbrushes (if you know what I mean), while extremely well filmed, wasn\u0027t nearly as good as that first scene. Thankfully the third \u0026 fifth scenes MORE than made up for that. Those two (starring Nina Hartley and Ginger Lynn respectively) are both smoking and reason enough for any porn aficionado to give this one a go. Sadly scene 4, being sandwiched in between two amazing scenes comes out lacking. And the last one with a solo Joanna Storm is totally lifeless and stale. All in all I do still recommend the film though.\n\nMy Grade: B+", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
