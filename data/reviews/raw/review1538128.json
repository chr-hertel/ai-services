The sets are non-existent (instead of scenery, black backgrounds for almost every set!), the lines are preposterous, the effects are laughable, and the acting swings wildly from over-acting to expressionless when there is supposed to be mortal danger. The paradoxes from time travel are barely dealt with.\n\nThis is the worst kind of bad movie: it is earnest about its story, but the execution is lacking. Therefore the movie can\u0027t be enjoyed for camp value. The budget must have been about $50. Catch the control panels in the time vault which are randomly numbered ... with house numbers from the hardware store! See the alien from 5000 years in the future who is obviously wearing a shower cap! 5000 years in the future, aliens from OUTSIDE our galaxy speak perfect English - why? They stand on pedestals of various heights - why? Why can\u0027t the aliens afford backgrounds either, if they are so advanced they can travel between galaxies? Why are the caves of 1 million years ago brightly lit inside?\n\nThe only thing that gives it two stars instead of one is the \"plot twist\", it\u0027s actually a good idea (that would have been told 10 times better by The Twilight Zone)." }
