I though that Glen Close did a wonderful job, even if she is considered to be \u0027miscast\u0027. Remakes never have to be exactly the same as the original, I think that the changes in age of that couple was very good and balanced out the young and old couples. I thought that Bloody Mary was wonderful! She was hilarious! I believe that her voice was excellently fit to the character, a person like that would not have a perfectly trained singing voice in most cases. So, I\u0027m glad that her voice sounded a bit wretched. Harry Connick, Jr. was superb. I was already a fan of his singing, but his voice in \u0027Younger than Springtime\u0027 has kept that song running through my head for a week now. Overall, it wasn\u0027t a perfect movie, but it was good and well worth to see again.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
