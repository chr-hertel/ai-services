Some matches were ace, some weren\u0027t.\n\nResults from Wrestlemania X-8 are as follows: - Rob Van Dam defeated William Regal to win the Intercontinental Championship in a solid opener.\n\n\n* Diamond Dallas Page defeated Christian in a useless match.\n\n\n\n* Spike Dudley defeated Goldust to win the Hardcore title (this match was Maven and Goldust, but Dudley ran down and pinned Goldust) - Edge pinned Booker T in a worthless match.\n\n\n\n* \u0027Stone Cold\u0027 Steve Austin pinned Scott hall in a rotten match (this showed when Austin walked out of the Federation for real shortly afterwards) \n\n\n\n* Kurt Angle defeated Kane in a good match.\n\n\n\n* The Hurricane defeated Spike Dudley to win the Hardcore title (backstage) \n\n\n\n* The Undertaker pinned Ric Flair in a fair match.\n\n\n\n* Mighty Molly pinned The Hurricane to win the Hardcore title (backstage) - The Rock defeated Hollywood Hogan in a very good match. The fans in this match were simply mad! They cheered Hogan instead of The Rock.\n\n\n\n* Christian pinned Mighty Molly to win the Hardcore title (backstage when Christian slammed a door in Molly\u0027s face) \n\n\n\n* Billy and Chuck defeated The APA, The Hardy Boyz and The Dudley Boyz in a four corners match to retain the WWE tag team belts.\n\n\n\n* Maven pinned Christian to win back the Hardcore title (in the car parking lot when Christian was day dreaming, Maven snuck up behind him and pinned him) \n\n\n\n* Jazz defeated Lita and Trish Stratus to retain the WWE Women\u0027s Championship.\n\n\n\n* The Rock pinned Hulk Hogan. The fans were really into this match. However fans booed Rock and cheered Hogan.\n\n\n\n* Triple H defeated Chris Jericho to win the Undisputed Championship. However fans were not that interested in this match and when Tripper won no one cared.\n\n\nOverall Grade - B", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
