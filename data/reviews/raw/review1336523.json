In this respect, I might compare it to the old fashioned fantasy romance Somewhere in Time, where the time travel also leaves much to be desired. I wouldn\u0027t expect elaborate technical science fiction explanations in what are essentially romances, but surely the screenwriters could manage something a bit more plausible than the self hypnosis of Somewhere in Time or this film\u0027s ridiculous time gap near the Brooklyn Bridge. They either shouldn\u0027t be putting this particular movie in the Science Fiction category or else come up with a more plausible mode of time travel. You have to suspend all brain function and logic for this explanation.\n\nThe plot revolves around a pretty 21st Century advertising executive named Kate, who lives in a New York City apartment with her brother, Charlie. Kate\u0027s ex boyfriend, Stuart, who lives upstairs, stumbles upon the time gap hitherto mentioned and travels back to the 1800\u0027s where he encounters a European aristocrat named Leopold. Circumstances prove such that Leopold follows Stuart forward to the 21 st Century, and Charlie becomes convinced that, like himself, Leopold is an actor. Confusion and hilarity ensue as Leopold, the proverbial fish out of water, tries to cope with the modern world and, in addition, the chemistry that is developing between him and Kate, who has sort of adopted him and obtained an acting job for him in a commercial.\n\nMeg Ryan is her usual charming, endearing self in the role of Kate, and the handsome Hugh Jackman most suitable as the dashing and chivalrous 19th Century Leopold. Supporting cast all seem competent, as I recall. However, I agree with another comment made that Kate swears too much (lazy screenplay writing) and it\u0027s odd that Leopold, who\u0027s from a more genteel era, seems to indicate no disapproval.\n\nFor the most part, I actually enjoyed this light hearted bit of fluff, apart from the time travel dimension being silly and unconvincing. I found the plot details quite confusing with regard to the time element, as to exactly what\u0027s supposed to be going on here. I would suggest that screenwriters avoid time travel altogether unless they can pull it off a little better, and simply stick with pure comedy romance. This is an entertaining chick flick or a good date movie, but definitely NOT science fiction.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
