Well, take away the chips and it\u0027s really just a mocumentary, but a mocumentary on a grand scale. Produced by Studio 8 Entertainment, Everything is Everything is documentary about three clueless individuals from Baton Rouge Louisiana who fight evil, rewrite the national anthem, and make a documentary about Abraham Lincoln. Yea, you read right.\n\nJustin Justice is Baton Rouge\u0027s number one crime fighter and schoolyard equipment examiner. He keeps the city, and playground children, safe from harm\u0027s way. Criminals might just stay clear and keep straight if they new this \"crime-fighting superhero\" even existed. Actually, they probably wouldn\u0027t care, but that isn\u0027t the point. His heart is in the right place, and his sights are set on President Bush. Oh, we\u0027re not talking assassination; we\u0027re talking protective services with baggy pants and a bitchin\u0027 superhero costume, cape included.\n\nDale Kernie believes he\u0027s composed the next great national anthem, along with other songs recanting the grandeur of Thanksgiving for example. Dale doesn\u0027t let little things like his lack of talent get in his way. His enthusiasm and optimistic determination could take him far, or at least he thinks so. As long as he can get his music heard he feels he\u0027s bound for fame and fortune. When you break it down, Dale is really just a pumped up version of Richard Simons, but a little more pathetic.\n\nRussell Cagle has a vision to create great cinema. You know the type of cinema that really hits you hard and pulls all your emotions to a festering stew. Like when Jaws attacks that helicopter in Jaws 2. Such great cinema deserves this mans struggle to produce his documentary. Knowing something about Lincoln would help, along with having equipment and crew. Russell is an almost homeless country-bumpkin moocher who belittles his companions and takes advantage of women for tens of dollars. This of course is OK, because he\u0027s got vision. Abraham Lincoln didn\u0027t quit; he got right back in his tank and kept on fighting the Nazi\u0027s. Russell carries that same go-getter attitude with him in pursuit of his documentary.\n\nNow although this isn\u0027t as great a mocumentary as \"Best in Show\" or \"A Mighty Wind\", it\u0027s defiantly a contender. Everything is Everything has its flaws. It\u0027s poorly lit at times, and has a home made feel to it. It\u0027s story is loose and ragged, and some of the timing is off or weird and some performances are awful. Additionally, the reason for the documentary is never established, and the eventual meeting in DC leaves something to be desired. But what Everything is Everything does have is some great original humor and at points the good really outweigh the bad. The main lead characters transform themselves into their characters and deliver line after line of seriousness that\u0027s often pure genius. Everything is Everything is defiantly worth the watch, especially if you\u0027re into mocumentary film-making. And even if your not, you can laugh at it instead of with it.\n\nFactoid: one good mocumentary is worth at least 500 bad films.\n\n\n* 3.5/5 Little Guys -\n" }
