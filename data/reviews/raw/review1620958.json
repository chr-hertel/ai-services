The story line is deceptively simple and not too convoluted. The characters are very believable and engaging, even the minor ones. However, I have to say that the greatest tribute goes without question to Dustin Hoffman. He delivers one heck of a performance. This was the one for which he should have gotten an Oscar, and not for Rainman. His acting here is smooth as silk, very natural and very believable. It is kinda like the work he did in \"Midnight Cowboy\" or \"Straw Dogs\". But then it is the material of the story that has to work for the actor to flesh out a truly believable character. Supporting cast also matter a great deal, and here we have the wonderful Andy Garcia (not Tom Cruise) and Geena Davis. I want also to commend the director of this movie, Stephen Frears, who although not quite a household name, consistently makes top-notch movies.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
