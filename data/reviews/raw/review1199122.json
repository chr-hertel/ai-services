Better than your average slick..!", "reviewBody": "I bought this DVD last week. I\u0027ve watched it for the first time with some friends. I must admit, that must be some movie.. Here, director Stephen Sommers try to prove that if Aliens scared you.. Then this one will do worse.. Well, it did at times.. The whole plot sounds simple to me.. with these bunch of thieves coming on board this cruise liner, the Argonautica.. Only to find that the passengers have vanished. It\u0027s not \u0027til they realise that they up against something more deadly and it came from the bottom of the ocean.. We\u0027re not talking giant squids here.. Something more sinister..\n\nTreat Williams played well as Finnegan. Famke Janssen, Wes Studi and the rest of the cast kept their end of the bargain with their performance. A really good film, full of one liners.. A few jokes.. This, that and the other..\n\n7 out of 10!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
