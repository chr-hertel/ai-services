I thought the Big Fish was original and told a warm story that will connect with anyone who has loved a parent as any child does and then lost them.\n\nBig Fish will remain with me for a very long time- a true keeper.\n\nNow, if we could get Follywood to endorse/produce similar art, then perhaps their movie attendance would creep back up.\n\n(Apologies for the soap box) \n\n(Can anyone tell me why a comment must have 10 lines? seems a little verbose to me- especially if you just want to submit a \"comment\"- but forgive me, I\u0027m a newbie register)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
