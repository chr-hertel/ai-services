I wouldn\u0027t say this is the best Danish movie I\u0027ve seen, but neither the worst. If you are in a lazy mood and just want to relax with a film and some popcorn before you head to bed, this movie might be the one to watch! The essence of the movie is \"what to do, if you get a deadly disease and your days are numbered?\" The movie is pretty much straight forward, but still makes you think of your own life and treasure it.\n\nI liked this movie, because it is very much down to earth. However it\u0027s not a movie that I would watch twice, very mediocre. So as previously stated, if you want a nice film to relax to its pretty good, but if your inviting friends over for a blockbuster, you might want to show something else.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
