It has it\u0027s moments but it is overall pointless. Family guy is a great show but this movie just does not do the show justice. Basically it was only three episodes of family guy and it ends there. there was no need for this to be a movie. It does not go as far as you might think. it\u0027s not inappropriate by the shows standards. in fact the new season of the show has gone farther than this Quoat UnQuoat movie did.\n\nIt\u0027s OK but it\u0027s nothing too special. If your not a fan of the show or have never seen it than just plain avoid this movie.\n\nIt could have been a hell of a lot better. I give it a five.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
