This special delivered a great in site to a man many under 35 only know in song and those B-Movie re-runs on mid day and late night TV. A good documentary on this famous man with many glimpses into his personal life that a lot of people probably never knew. It was a worth while effort on the part of his family to make this movie and is well worth a look see by those who missed it when it shows again on TV.\n\nIt was put together with a lot of style, integrating some of the themes of his songs with pictures and home/new video clips of his life. Also a good sprinkling of never before seen (or heard) moments of both Elvis and Percilla\u0027s personal family life and the professional life of the \"King of Rock and Roll\".", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
