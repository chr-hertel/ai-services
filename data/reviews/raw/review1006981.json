But when the sci-fi memory erasing kicks in and they attempt to erase each other from their respective memories is when this movie gets interesting. It is a colorful, wild ride. Not my favorite movie, but it was entertaining. I suppose it was inevitable that Kirsten Dunst\u0027s character turns into the woman scorned who returns everyone\u0027s memory tapes, but that whole part of the film was a little sleazy. I think all of the performers did amazing characterizations. It was truly unique and gets points just for that. If you are not fond of the weird and the deep, rent Laws of Attraction. But, if you don\u0027t mind coloring outside the lines, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is worth a look.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
