Flywheel, the private eye, Harpo is Wacky, his silent partner and Chico is Ravelli, the bodyguard of the singer Tommy Rogers (Tony Martin).The amazing Margaret Dumont makes her last appearance with the Marx brothers playing Martha Phelps.It was most hilarious in all those movies to watch Groucho court Margaret and at the same time humiliate her the worst way.She didn\u0027t seem to mind.The Big Store is an underrated gem that shouldn\u0027t be thrown away.There are lots of scenes that raise this movie higher than many modern movies would deserve to be raised.It\u0027s incredible to watch the brothers roller skating in the store.There are also some musical numbers in the movie.It\u0027s great to watch and listen to Groucho singing \"Sing While You Sell\".There\u0027s the lady (Virginia O\u0027Brien) singing \"Rock-A-Bye Baby with a frozen face.I just loved her! Chico and Harpo playing piano together is just hilarious! Harpo playing his beloved harp with the mirror reflections is just magical! I\u0027m just reading Harpo Marx\u0027 autobiography \"Harpo Speaks!\".It\u0027s fascinating to read how these brothers grew up in poverty under the wings of Minnie and Frenchie and became the comedy team everybody loves.These brothers worked great as a team.The viewer can sense that.That\u0027s probably why we still love them.It\u0027s timeless, their humor.You can live the 1940\u0027s or whatever decade or millennium, it always works.If somebody woke them up now and they\u0027d be back in the moving pictures, the movie theaters would be packed with people.And the laughter would be heard miles away.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
