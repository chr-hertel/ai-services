The other night I saw it on TV, because I wanted to know if it was so bad than what I had thug\u0027s, and I realized I was very, very wrong. Mean Girls is a great teen movie, and is a good picture of teenager\u0027s world and life in high school. The movie tells the story of Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan), a teenager who used to live in Africa and used to be home-schooled. But when she moves to America with her parents everything in Cady\u0027s life changes, she meets girl world. In her second day at school she meets Regina George (Rachel McAdams) and her group, the plastics, but she makes the mistake to fall in love with Regina\u0027s ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels, and when she realizes about it she takes Aaron back. So Cady, along with her friends Janis and Damian, start the revenge plan. Great movie, great screenplay by Tina Fey (I hope I will watch more movies based on screenplays written by her in the future), great performances. Don\u0027t miss Mean Girls. Score: 8/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
