And what a disappointment!!! First of all, the distance between the book and the film can most easily be measured in light-years. But that might not have been a problem, if made in the \"spirit\" of the book.. or at least in a comical, fun way..\n\nThe original film was great, but the special effects where slightly.. hooky... So I hoped at least that Sephods head was going to be more convincing in the new film. But it was WORSE !!! SHAME ON YOU !!!\n\nWas it assumed that movie-watchers are dumber than those who read the book?? Why the dumbing down of the story?? \n\nPlease make a new film... please!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
