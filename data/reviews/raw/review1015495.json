It is very confusing especially as \"Ignacio\" keeps transforming himself into different people about every 15 minutes. Bernal really has the potential to be a great actor, but in this movie he is stretched out like a rubber band and either he had no clue as to what was going on or the director simply lost it and let the movie drift. It just has too many twists and turns. If the basic movie had been simpler then maybe the actors might have had a chance to develop their performances. I mean some of the sex scenes are laughable, and that may have been the intent, but I think the audience is being titillated at the expense of the actors. The sub plot with the kids moves right along and then like the movie itself, suddenly hits a wall and we are shifted into another time zone. Too bad, cause the movie had potential and it is entertaining, but you feel like you are lost in a rat\u0027s maze with no sign of an exit.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
