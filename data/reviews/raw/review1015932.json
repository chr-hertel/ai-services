I\u0027d read the book and fell in love. It tells a love story between two men and the way they have to carry it out despite society rules (with some changes it still happens nowadays...).\n\nThe general message would be \"love conquers all\" but is it really so? Are Maurice and Scudder able to live happily ever after? I doubt, and on the beginning of the XXth century it would be even worse.\n\nDespite all, it\u0027s lovely to watch the same kind of story we\u0027re used to watching in movies that portray society in different times, but now speaking about love between men! Although James Ivory\u0027s work is beyond criticism, in my point a view, there were some scenes in the book (the one when they are in London, sitting naked by the fire, for instance) that really should be in the movie.\n\nBut it\u0027s a tender and romantic approach of of book (only published after E.M. Foster\u0027s death) that surely would have pleased it\u0027s author.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
