Which is good, because this is an actor-driven film. The weak, surgery-based thriller plot and the fast pacing by the director don\u0027t leave much to be desired. with that said, the two main actors working together give this film more than enough reason to watch.\n\nThe actors don\u0027t have much room to stretch out in this film and show their full potential. I\u0027m talking about all the actors. While I can point out the two main ones, the rest of the medical crew are all - mostly comedy-oriented, mind you - very talented. They appear in numerous TV dramas, and are good at holding up shows with the dumbest of plots. With Team Batista, you have an A-list team of Japanese actors who can all hold their own, but are herded together for this commercial film.\n\nFor the Japanese drama-and-movie uninitiated, this film will seem mildy entertaining. It doesn\u0027t hold up as a medical drama in any sense, as not much attention is paid to the medical stuff. Not that that\u0027s a bad thing. Who wants to watch a bloody surgery, when it could be a harsh reality for a lot of us in the real world as we get older? There\u0027s not much comedy, either. It\u0027s there, but it\u0027s tongue-in-cheek humor, not bust-a-gut laughing kind.\n\nSo what\u0027s to like about this movie? Even though the actore don\u0027t shine much - the script and the direction don\u0027t give them much room to flex, as I\u0027ve said before - this is one of those films that make you think, \"Wow! They\u0027re working together, I want to see their on screen chemistry!\" Abe Hiroshi really shines in TV dramas. \"Dragon Zakura\" comes to mind easily, though that\u0027s probably something you won\u0027t find easily on DVD. No matter. What littls acting he does in this film, he really shines. It\u0027s just the tip of the iceberg for his real abilities, but have no doubt - he\u0027s one of the finest actors in Japan, period. He can take the lousiest script and make it feasible with his over-the-top abilities. He does a fine job in this as the harsh investigator.\n\nYuko Takeuchi is slightly different, as her downplayed role can be misunderstood as poor acting. If you can, take the time to find the movie \u0027Heaven\u0027s Bookstore\u0027 which should be widely available. She plays two roles in that film, showing a great range of her skills. When she plays the docile, politically-correct investigator in this film, it will seem very downplayed to one who doesn\u0027t know her from other films. But knowing how she plays her roles, her passive attitude in Batista really helps Abe Hiroshi shine when he makes his grand entrance.\n\nTeam Batista is a real treat for Japanese TV/Cinema regulars, just to see the team-up of Hiroshi and Takeuchi, surrounded by some great - though limited - performances of some lesser-known TV actors.\n\nIf you don\u0027t know any of the actors, pay attention to them, and not the story, and let that be a teaser to let you seek out their other film and TV performances.\n\nThis is a solid, middle-of-the-road mainstream commercial film. I have the Japanese DVD because I love the actors, and don\u0027t regret picking it up. But I think you really need to see Takeuchi\u0027s performance in \u0027Heaven\u0027s Bookstore\u0027 to really appreciate Team Batista.\n\nThis movie, while not great on its own, is definitely not a waste of time. A must-see for Japanese entertainment fans!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
