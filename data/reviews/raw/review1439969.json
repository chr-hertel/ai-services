For the best experience, I recommend watching in Japanese, with subs if you need them. The original script and voice talent doesn\u0027t need the Hollywood treatment.\n\nSuch a beautiful story! I\u0027m a cat lover, and I\u0027m sure that helps me enjoy the movie more, but it\u0027s just great as a tale and you could apply any animal to the basic plot and get a similar result.\n\nEvery time I watch it I have a big pile of hankies nearby, as it never fails to move me. If you like the emotional feed-off you get from a nice sentimental feel-good film, you should really give this a go! Probably my favourite animated film ever.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
