While not quite reaching the heights that \u0027Minder\u0027 did for Waterman, it\u0027s nevertheless highly entertaining - and he does get to sing the title theme...AGAIN.\n\nThe real star though, is Alun Armstrong, whose portrayal of obsessive alcoholic savant Brian is both funny and touching; and the storybase of a \"cold case\" police unit made up of retired ex-coppers allows plenty of latitude for self-deprecating humour. Amanda Redman is always good value too, and she doesn\u0027t disappoint here as the no-nonsense boss of this team of superannuated mavericks.\n\nYes, there are lots of clich√©s and several improbable situations, but overall it\u0027s a good-natured romp with a bunch of old pros. I always try to watch it if I\u0027m in.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
