Punchy, hard and brutal. You don\u0027t like anyone in the film - your\u0027re not meant to and it\u0027s all the better for it. Kirk Douglas is a loud-mouthed, down at heel has-been reporter who seizes on an opportunity of a man trapped in a mine as his meal ticket back to the big time. He has his town hangers on and nearing the end of the film the whole town and beyond is feverish with the publicity, all making a tidy little profit (hamburger stalls circus\u0027s fairgrounds etc..) Kirk\u0027s relationship with the waitress, herself wanting a meal ticket passage out of town, is fantastically well read. She\u0027s tough, she\u0027s always had the bad hand in life but compared to kirk, she\u0027s a pussycat. In one scene she retorts to Kirk \"I\u0027ve met a lot of hard-boiled eggs in my time, but you--you\u0027re twenty minutes\" A must see-film and certainly in the top 100 of all time.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
