Yes, the characters were rather stereotypical and yes, the acting could have been better, but one does not expect Oscar-worthy performances of the likes of Road to Perdition or Million Dollar Baby when watching a teen comedy... I thought the story had enough of an interesting storyline (everything they tried seemed to make him more popular when they were trying to do the opposite) and that the moral of the movie was good (that in the end, even in the case to \"get even\", deception is wrong). Some people seemed unhappy with the ending. I am not sure what other kind of ending people would have preferred seeing. Perhaps they would rather have seen this as a teen horror flick where everyone gets killed in the end...?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
