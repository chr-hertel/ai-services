My girlfriend and I started TiVoing it at the beginning and now it\u0027s become a must watch on Tuesday nights. the fact that a film crew is following these climbers to a location that normal people can\u0027t even think of doing is just Amazing. Last nights drama (12/12/06 episode) kept me on the edge of my sofa.....Cant\u0027 wait for next weeks episode......Tim turn your dumb ass around.......... Ten lines is to much......I said what I wanted to say and adding anymore is as if you are forcing words into my mouth.....how would you feel if someone was trying to force you to say more than you felt was pertinent to the thoughts you had.......simple, to the point is better than crappy filler that just rambles on........sorry. you forced me to write this!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
