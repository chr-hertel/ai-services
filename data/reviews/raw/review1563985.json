I have always admired Freddy Rodriguez after first seeing him on the super TV series \"Six Feet Under\" and wanted to see how his career in movies and TV started. What a disappointment to say the very least with such TRIPE and senseless nonsense as this DVD movie \"Shock TV\"!! What a waste of time, effort, actor\u0027s skills and plot content as this movie actually is, besides a total waste of petrochemical resources to reproduce such trash on the DVD media used to vend this product!!! Therefore I gave this movie the bottom-most vote and would have chosen a ZERO if that option had been offered, and without my being cast into the \u0027spoilers\u0027 classification!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
