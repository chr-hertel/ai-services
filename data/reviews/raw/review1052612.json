Not just \"sprawling New Yorker stuff\". I have watch this film again and again. Every time I watch. I find a something new, or a deep hidden meaning. it definitely a film you have to see more than once. Nick Cage\u0027s Oscar worthy performance was sensational. The way he managed to plays both Charlie and Donald Kaufman in such contrasting character styles was ground breaking. Chris Cooper\u0027s Oscar winning performance is sensational. \"John Laroache is such a fun Character\" Copper makes him a legend. Then you add the The Classy Meryl Streep as Susan Orlean, and you get in my opinion the most watchable film in years. Kaufman, Jones and Adaptation inspired me to Restart Film writing. As soon as I finished watching, I picked up a pen and a pad.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
