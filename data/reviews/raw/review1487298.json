I thought that the acting and the direction of this movie was very real. Maby the story line was a little \"out there\" but it really was great as far as the acting goes. I never once through the whole movie got the impression that the acting was fake. In fact i don\u0027t know if I\u0027ve seen too many movies where there is not at least one scene where i stopped and thought hmm thats Samual L Jackson, or wow that Tom Cruise really over acts in his movies. Not this one. The whole movie the characters were very human. I definitely recommend this movie. It doesn\u0027t look like much on the surface but when you watch it you will be enthralled.\n\nMike Webber", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
