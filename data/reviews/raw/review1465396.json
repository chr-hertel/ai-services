Although the movie was well made, I can\u0027t help to think that it should have been titled \u0027Look at Me!\u0027. This man was clearly dealing with mental illness, and although I think his intentions were well meaning, I am sure he has done more harm than good to the grizzlies he was claiming to protect by creating a comfort zone for the bears to feel free to approach humans and potentially be killed for getting too close. Had Tim been properly educated on how to observe and document behaviors of the bears, he would known that the best protection for those bears would have been to study them from afar and work with, not against the local park rangers. I must admit, that I initially thought this film was a parody of an actual scientist because I found myself laughing at Tims outrageous and immature behavior not to mention his constant need to like a \u0027surfer dude\u0027. It seemed that Tim had used the bears as a venue to satisfy his egocentric needs to the point where even a happy face drawn on a rock was conceived to be a direct threat against him! I just can\u0027t help to think, that at the end of the day, how sad it is that Tim, and tragically his girlfriend, ended up getting the clearest picture of grizzly behavior. I only hope that the bear that attacked them was spared its life as it was only doing exactly what grizzlies do best...eat and protect themselves.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
