Also, I\u0027m surprised to see how FUNNY those \u0027jokes\u0027 for some of the users: maybe, they even laughed at \"San Diego - vagina\" translation - for some of them it\u0027s even \"memorable\"... that\u0027s pathetic...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
