But all those would ultimately come to one bottomline: I don\u0027t give the credit to the director, as it is Kaufman\u0027s masterpiece screen writing that brings such magic to this film to make it one of the best examples of modern fimmaking.\n\nThe idea of revisiting the memories is so overused and equally ill-treated in films that I\u0027m sure every other screenwriter would mess it up in the end. But Kaufman pulled it off flawlessly. In a non-linear film such as this, I\u0027m also surprised by the directing style. And it also helped to have such a fantastic cast. Carrey, playing a normal commonplace guy this time without any of his trademark characteristics and antics, reminds us that he is primarily a genius actor regardless of the type of film. Winslet, having a magnificent consistency of skill in each film is always a treat to watch. Her portrayal of Clementine is perhaps one of her bests... along with Finding Neverland and Jude. And there are also good supporting roles played by Wilkinson and the ever-interesting Mark Ruffalo.\n\nThe film does carry an interesting message about love and relationship and sacrifice and adjustment. Those who can relate to them will definitely like the film more and more. When I saw the film a year ago, I didn\u0027t have any such experience which could make me take the film more personally. But I do have one now, which I can somehow relate to the film\u0027s message. That made me discover its wonders again.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
