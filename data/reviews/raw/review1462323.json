One of the best couple of Bollywood screen Rajesh and Mumtaz in this film. The film is great and with great locations, songs and brilliant clothes. If you are fan of Rajesh Khanna and Mumtaz then you should watch it even your not a fan still great film. Jeevan is amazing as he is. Mumtaz looks stunning and Rajesh looks damn good. The direction is at its best also. Great Music and Songs as well. The singer on playback is different then usual. I think its a fun film that you can watch with anyone either friends, family or with your Bf too. I have watched it so many times too and its excellent film. I am a biggest fan of Mumtaz and she has done a great job like she is in any of her other films so watch it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
