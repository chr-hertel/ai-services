There is many dirty jokes, much of them are pretty stupid too and that\u0027s what is good about it. It\u0027s not all about sex there was whole one minute which wasn\u0027t about sex. I\u0027m talking about \"there can be only one\" scene, which was really funny, funnier than that was only the scene where Seth Rogen\u0027s character showed his school-photo. So if you like stupid but at the same time funny jokes, you should watch this film, because there is lots of stupid jokes. The movie is also very well directed and has some great tracks, like Blondie\u0027s \"Dreaming\"", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
