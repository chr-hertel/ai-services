The actors aren\u0027t bad, but it is the gory and bloody scenes that makes it bad. The \u0027\u0027monsters\u0027\u0027 in this movie is just ridicules. You don\u0027t even get frighten by them. Every time i saw them i began laughing.\n\nWes Craven didn\u0027t direct this time, he left that job to Alexandre Aja. Instead he wrote and produced the movie.\n\nYou should never watch this movie because it is really bad. Horror movies like The sixth sense, Scream, The grudge and The amityville horror is much, much better.\n\nIt\u0027s not the worst horror ever made, but is still very bad.\n\nI recommend this movie for those who loves bad movies.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
