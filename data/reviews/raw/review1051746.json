At school he got the nickname, \"Shiza,\" but he turns out to be smart, tough, and humane  a powerful combination at any age. His real name is Mustapha (the slinky, smiling young actor\u0027s called Oldzhas Nusupbayev, all these people are Kazaks and the film is in Russian), and he has more of the criminal psychopath in him  there are signs that his sense of right and wrong is a bit loose  but whatever roughness he has is mitigated by the kindness he shows when a guy he\u0027s helped recruit to fight gets killed and Schizo takes on the dead fighter\u0027s girlfriend and her little boy as his responsibility and his new family.\n\nThis is the best rough crime adventure storytelling on film since the Chinese \"Blind Shaft\". The boy is lean and dark and graceful and his face has a Slavic Mogul beauty, and it\u0027s impassive till he shows his big sudden smile. This is pure narrative without introspection, and the fun of it, what makes it fresh and newly minted from shot to shot, is that we don\u0027t know what Mustapha has inside, so everything that happens  his determination, stamina, and spirit, his willingness to take on poses like a pair of dark glasses and a cigarette dangling from the corner of the mouth in a mirror (a bit like Belmondo mimicking Bogie in Godard\u0027s \"Breathless\")  is all a gift. Like a true picaresque anti-hero Mustapha is a social reject, but capable of blending in anywhere and slipping by without lasting damage.\n\nIn the opening scene Mustapha\u0027s mom takes him to a doctor, a boorish chap all done up in stiff whites like a sous-chef. It seems she\u0027s bought the idea that her son\u0027s defective, because she\u0027s going to save up for him to get treatment. But her boyfriend Sakura (Eduard Tabishev) sees that he can be a harmless helper in his fight schemes if he\u0027ll keep silent and help lure in fall guys. Schizo proves to be more than that, a cocky kid with a certain panache, a sliding swagger of a walk, an ability to swill down vodka with grown men. But his independent spirit soon leads him away from his mom\u0027s boyfriend and out on his own.\n\nThe events that follow shouldn\u0027t be revealed, but they\u0027re both natural and surprising, and it\u0027s a deft adventure that leads toward wisdom and happiness.\n\nThe people are intensified because of their toughness and the desolate harsh beauty of the scenery. Zinka (Olga Landina), the girl Schizo adopts, is a cross between Mia Farrow and Sissy Spacek. Her exchanges with Schizo are priceless, largely because of his combination of naivete and boldness. The rough men around the fight scene aren\u0027t caricatures; they\u0027re just tough and vivid. One event follows hard upon another and there\u0027s an edge of danger and menace but also a growing sense that this Mustapha fellow is both an operator and a sweetie-pie. Such a combination might seem corny sometimes, but it works fine here. The writing is economical (imagine early Hemingway with a Kazhakistan accent), the direction and editing are spare and energetic. The narrative delivers its little surprises with raw poetry, like a good short story. This first film is a little gem." }
