Try to watch the movie again and focus on what she does throughout the movie. She\u0027s just everywhere without doing anything and contributing nothing.\n\nI bet she himself doesn\u0027t know what she\u0027s talking about at times. The whole movie was such a mess and I don\u0027t know how this movie got such a high rating in IMDb. \n\nDon\u0027t even watch it on DVD. It\u0027s a complete waste of time.\n\nAVOID AT ALL COST!!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
