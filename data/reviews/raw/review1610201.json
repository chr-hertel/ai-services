A lot of people think this show is crap, a lot of people think it\u0027s funny as hell. Some think it\u0027s immature, some think it\u0027s comedy gold. I can\u0027t really say much about this show which would appeal to everyone. I, personally, thought it was funny. It\u0027s a lot better than some of the stuff Adult Swim has been showing recently (Assy Mcguee, Morel Orel). The show in question, has a very random sense of humor, and this is what I think is the main turn-off for many people. Others, the ones who like it, see through this, and like the show BECAUSE of it\u0027s randomness. I am one of them, I think the show is good, and that\u0027s my opinion. I can\u0027t say the same for you. What I say, is take a look at an episode, and see if you like it. I think it would be worth your time, but again, you might think otherwise.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
