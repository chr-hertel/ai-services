If low brow, slutty, British sit com fare is your style, this is definitely not for you. First of all it\u0027s very smart stuff. Secondly the script is handled very deftly by almost everyone connected with it. Kudos to the director! Tamsin Grieg has a face built for comedy, a sort of sexier Lily Tomlin, and her timing is exquisite! The American (a real one, for a change) is excellent as well, if a tad too good looking for a lonely single.\n\nThe two play a couple, possibly (hopefully) destined to meet, but in the mean time they passively, reluctantly, pursue the dating game. Each episode is another disaster waiting to happen. Sometimes you can see it coming other times you can\u0027t, but you know it\u0027s coming. Just what will make this one a disaster?\n\nMy favorite scene, so far, is when the parents of Tamsin\u0027s ex boyfriend of some 10 years, show up to tell her he\u0027s passed away and to hand over tapes he made of him and Tamsin having sex. The old couple play it absolutely straight and innocently, and Tamsin\u0027s facial expressions show her skills as a comedian, who knows how to be subtle, instead of obvious.\n\nMy wife is impatient to have the two meet, but I want to wait and savor the moment, when (if) it comes.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
