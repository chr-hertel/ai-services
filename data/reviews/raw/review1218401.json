The music, the dress wear, the hair, the personalities; it\u0027s all there! It makes you feel as if you are in with The Sex Pistols themselves. There was no Sex Pistols, Sid Vicious IS The Sex Pistols! Just like any lead singer, they are the band. This movie will make you want to slug Nancy, because the actress is a prime example of a junkie. This shows the public on how the drug scene is, and why you wouldn\u0027t want to be a part of it. It\u0027s a whole separate world. What a world! You wouldn\u0027t want to be a part of it, but it is definitely interesting to get an insight on what went on, and what still goes on today. For the most of the part, punk is dead, new punk is all out there." }
