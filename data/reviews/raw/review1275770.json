And even though a major plot point in the story stretches the realm of possibility a bit too far, this forgotten little film deserves a better fate than its present public-domain, bargain bin video status. \n\nThe plot revolves around John Muller (Henreid), who organizes a major casino heist with a few of his pals. When the sting is botched, Muller runs as far away as he can with his ill-gotten gains. The casino\u0027s owner, a gangster (who bears an interesting likeness to Richard Conte) isn\u0027t planning on taking this robbery on his back. He dispatches two of his more intimidating thugs to locate him and ... well ... retrieve the stolen money. \"Even if it takes you 20 years,\" he demands. In a desperate attempt to conceal himself from the vengeful clutches of the fore-mentioned gangster, Muller engineers a plan to impersonate a psychologist who, as it turns out, is a carbon-copy lookalike of himself. The only difference between the two is a rigid scar that outlines his left cheek. Can Muller find it within himself to kill the psychologist and begin living a double life? Will the gangsters guns find him first?\n\nI have to admit, with the exception of a couple of protracted scenes, \"The Scar\" truly is a first-rate thriller. Steve Sekely directs, punctuating just about every scene with classic film noir iconography. Daniel Fuchs\u0027 script is also top-notch ... which may have served as a primer for his next project ... the indelible \"Criss Cross\" for Universal. (He also penned \"Panic in the Streets,\" another great, oft-overlooked film noir starring Richard Widmark.) Joan Bennett\u0027s performance comes off as a trifle pallid ... but then again, this was Henreid\u0027s picture from the get-go. He commands every scene that he appears in with suave acumen, something that I missed from his performance in the overrated \"Casablanca.\" I\u0027ll be the first to admit that I\u0027ve not seen many of his other pictures. But Henreid really won me over with this film ... he deserves a far better acknowledgement than only as \"the other guy\" of \"Casablanca.\"\n\nMore than anything, I think \"The Scar\" (or \"Hollow Triumph\" ... whatever) is a classic example of just how absent-minded popular culture really is. More than ever, movie-goers expect a film that is saturated in bloody action, quick-cuts, and talentless actors. There\u0027s not a lot going for movies, today. And thankfully ... most of what\u0027s out there will have been long-forgotten by the popular culture consciousness in a few years. I think that modern pop culture has unfairly labeled film noir as being movies lavished with shadows, dames and guns. And while all of these are inherent to the genre, they forget the cold, black heart that beats beneath its surface. \"The Scar\" thrives on this kind of energy. It\u0027s a classic example of what made film noir great ... and why we\u0027ll never see anything like it ever again.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
