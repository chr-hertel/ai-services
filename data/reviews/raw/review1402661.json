Rodney is quite simple and down to earth, i love this show, it is probably the best family show of all times! i especially love that this show focuses on family and importance of father\u0027s presence in his kids lives. Rodney is funny as hell,i love his songs and stand up comedy. and on the show the rest of the cast do their thing really well,we all want the best for our kids, but we can find ourselves in situations where unwillingly we disappoint them, now who hasn\u0027t found himself in that situation? the entire show is well made, hope it stays on for a long time.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
