It helps if you have a bit of a sadistic side, as there is a fair amount of cruelty depicted - of course, it\u0027s all in good fun. This movie is absolutely bizarre, check rationalization at the door, sit back, and let go. Apparently, I need 10 lines of text to submit this comment, so excuse me for taking a little extra babbling to fill in the gap. All I wanted to do was leave a short and sweet note - apparently I\u0027m supposed to get all Roger Ebert/Gene Siskel. OK, pretend I have a big, obnoxious mustache and I\u0027m giving a thumbs up. Am I there yet? Yes, I made it! Congrats to me, and may you all find 88 minutes of entertainment with this flick. (Whoah, I made it to 11, no, 12 lines!!!)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
