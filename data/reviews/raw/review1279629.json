Instead of the \"un\"usual fare that Hollywood promotes, I KNOW you know what I\u0027m talking about.\n\nOkay, so it is a PG-13 movie yet shows violence and partial nudity. (I would not necessarily take my 8-year-old nephew unless he was properly informed about the norms of other cultures living so close to the equator) Nevertheless, this movie shows how uninformed and superstitious these tribal people in Ecuador were and trying to live off the tropical land was particularly arduous. Thankfully, 50 years ago missionaries felt called to go to them to reach into their darkness. Apparently, there was a 60% mortality rate because they killed each other even in their own tribe and not just warring with their neighbors. No grandfathers, in this particular tribe, had existed for as long as they kept history. Becoming extinct was their future not because of infiltration of white man, but because of the brutality against each other. When the Christian message finally penetrated this darkness, thanks to these fearless missionaries, there was peace at last. The thought by the main character had been, you have to be fierce and savage in order to cross the Great Boa (Amazon River) otherwise you become weak and die as a termite.\n\nThe main point of the story is about redemption, forgiveness and Christ\u0027s love for us. The film does not use the word \"Jesus\" (in fact, much of what you hear is a tribal tongue with English subtitles) and they don\u0027t quote any Bible verses either. However, you see how the \"end\" of the spear really means a time to quit devouring each other with hate and superstition and to embrace God\u0027s love in order to pass to the other side of the Great Boa (or heaven in our vernacular).\n\nThis movie from start to finish has been artfully done. If you go to see it, watch at the beginning for a river delta that really looks like \"The End of the Spear.\" (use your imagination, perhaps) This true story is based on the Saints account of this \"tragedy\" where Nate Saint\u0027s son Steve and his family return to Ecuador in 1995 to be missionaries to the tribe who killed his father. They are \"saints\" to bring love full circle to the very people who tore up his family. As the credits are rolling by at the end, there are funny clips with Steve Saint talking and spending time with the very man who killed his father.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
