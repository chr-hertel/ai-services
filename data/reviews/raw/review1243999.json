None of the B westerns are known for a high degree of realism, but a certain degree of realism could have been easily achieved in this film (as well as other Autrey films, Roy Rogers films, etc.) without hurting the plot or the enjoyment of the movie. In one scene, Gene asks the Mexican police (who are riding motorcycles) how he could catch up with the baddies, who have a head-start in a car. The police tell him about a shortcut through the hills. Gene then takes off aboard Champion, leading the police in the chase! He doesn\u0027t even know exactly where the shortcut is, yet he (on a horse no less), outdistances police who are familiar with the shortcut \u0026 are riding motorcycles, amazing! He ends up jumping from a 20 foot high boulder into a car speeding along a road at 40 miles per hour, \u0026 of course lands right in the back seat without so much as a bump or a scratch. Superman has no advantages over this cowboy! When I was a kid, I just knew I liked Hoppy better than Gene or Roy, but couldn\u0027t explain why. Ironically, despite the lack of realism, this is probably the best Gene Autrey film I\u0027ve seen, so if Gene\u0027s a favorite of yours, this is a relatively good one. I rate it 5/10." }
