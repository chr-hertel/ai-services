The movie-making skills of Vishal Bhardwaj are certainly not poor, but with this film, he surely notches up his ranking in our minds by so much more. The one thing I could notice while seeing the movie was the spellbound effect it had on the hall ... when the audience was ready to leave, there was not a sound.... till all came out and then a few blurted that they did not get the message of the movie.... well, guess what??... the story doesn\u0027t exude any message.. all it tries to do is give the \"Indian\" or better still \"rural UP\" touch to the Bard\u0027s masterpiece... Get awed by Saif\u0027 maturity in acting, or Ajay\u0027s powerful rendition... this movie deserves as much praise as any other classic this whole decade ! Cheers Vishal...carry on...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
