Fox musicals were almost always rather forgettable, with their insipid songs and frequently bad singing. However, they were also bright and colorful, since Fox used Technicolor longer and more frequently than the \"Tiffany\" studio, MGM. \"The Farmer Takes a Wife\" is especially charming in costume, art and set decoration.\n\nBetty Grable is, well, Betty Grable, and if you adore her (and I do), you\u0027re likely to adore \"The Farmer Takes a Wife\". Betty\u0027s ably supported by Dale Robertson, John Carroll, Eddie Foy, Jr. and, the always wonderful Thelma Ritter. I won\u0027t pretend it\u0027s a great movie, or even a good movie, but \"The Farmer Takes a Wife\" is a \"Betty Grable\" movie, and that\u0027s good enough for me. I give \"The Farmer Takes a Wife\" a \"6\".", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
