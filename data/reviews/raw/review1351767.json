The movie became a success when released on video and shown on television and is now considered as one of the best movies ever.\n\nThe story is about a man named Andy Dufrane, sent to Shawshank Redemption for the murder of his wife and her lover. Although the story seems very simple, its very gripping and engaging, and you want to watch it to the end.\n\nIn Shawshank Prison, we as the audience find lovable and characters we can relate and sympaphise with. Even though they are convicts, murderers, etc...\n\nThe acting is the strongest point in the film, as the characters played magnificently and uplifting by people Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.\n\nOverall, The Shawshank Redmption will always be considered one of the greatest movies ever made, and a personal favourite of mine", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
