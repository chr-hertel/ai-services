Patricia Kaas sings, yes, and that makes the film charming, but singing is not enough. I mean, if you want to get all benefits of this one, go buy Patricia\u0027s CD and enjoy! The plot is simple (if to omit the \"dreams\"); the main characters seem to love each other instantly, and as well instantly forget their other acquaintances. Relationships appear almost \"mandatory\", and the little \"detective story\" thrown in just makes things worse. What at first appeared to be a perfect movie ending, is first screwed up and then comes out as just a dream. I measure movies by how well I would remember them, and for this one, I already started to forget the details.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
