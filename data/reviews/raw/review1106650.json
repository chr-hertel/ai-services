Yet there are still people who do. Adam and Paul proves this as well as showing the hopeless deprivation homeless junkies exist in. It\u0027s not depressing, unless you\u0027re a junkie yourself and are heading in that direction.\n\nIn the course of one single day, Adam and Paul try to scam their way through hunger, friends and their relentless need for more heroin. They are clueless, zombified and about as dead as living people get. It\u0027s hard to feel sorry for them, in fact you\u0027ll probably feel as much contempt for them as their former friends (hardly first-class citizens themselves) do when they show up and mooch.\n\nIf you think your life is crap then you need only to compare it to Adam and Paul to cheer yourself up. And if you were ever tempted by drugs then this film ought to put you off that curiosity.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
