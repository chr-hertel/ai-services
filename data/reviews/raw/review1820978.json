The only two words which can actually describe this excuse for a movie. I went to watch it after seeing the teaser trailers a few times, and because a few of my mates had told me it was awesome. However, the trailer is just about the whole movie. Nothing happens (aside from the little mini \"aliens\"... which look VERY familiar...) that I didn\u0027t already know from the trailer. And the dialogue??? The oh-so-cheesy all American look at me I\u0027m the best dialogue? the two worst lines out of any movie have to go to Cloverfield - \"Are you still filming?\" \"Yeah, people are gonna want to know... you know... how it all went down\" And then, in a false macho accent \"So lets make this clear. We either die here, die in the tunnel or die on the surface\" I\u0027ve seen better dialogue and production values in the Teletubbies!!! The themes are exactly the same as EVERY other action movie since 9/11. They even do a fairly sick parody of the infamous video of the rubble flying down the street and people taking cover in the buildings. Totally disappointed with this movie, but then its JJ Abrams. He seems to be the MASTER of overrated rubbish.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
