Unless that these Shrek DVD was for Europe, the trailer showed the time of first release (in USA!). So I waited, and waited, and waited - and then they announced Madagascar for Europe. I could see this movie, some weeks later I could buy the DVD, because you can enjoy the movie more than one time. It\u0027s funny. The style is a bit unusual, when I compare with Shrek, Jimmy Neutron, Monsters inc. etc. but it works and gives to the movie a special charm. I guess, the makers of \"Madagascar\" are a little inspired by the french cartoon series \"Wild instinct\", because some similarities. It\u0027s a movie I can recommend at all, it can impress in cinema and on DVD (and this is not always granted, some movies disappoint outside cinemas).", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
