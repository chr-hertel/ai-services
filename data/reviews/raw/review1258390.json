I guess saut√©ing was too complicated. Anyway, it is a very good film, and I agree that Wordsworth conveys the torture of being taken over by an alien life form while still retaining his humanity. You can also feel the paranoia of the Cold War era, and some remnants of World War 2- at one point the police order the bomb shelters searched. One of the astronauts also seems to have a German name, and maybe this is a reference to the role of German rocket scientists who went to the US after WW2.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
