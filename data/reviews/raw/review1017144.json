However, this would not have been possible without the ingenuity of Messrs. Lau and Kaiser, not to mention the other hundreds of thousands of people who helped make this film a feast of sight and sound. Just beware, the last song will get stuck in your head...FOREVER.\n\nWhether it\u0027s a camera that moves with the fluidity of a riversnake that you\u0027re looking for, or a rich tapestry of harmony, or a hummable melody or great acting or beautiful people or great sets, costumes, props and effects, this film has it all. This is the film that ALMOST made me forget about \"Intersectia.\"" }
