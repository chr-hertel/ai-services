Bruce Willis plays Mclane brilliantly easily the best action hero of all time and no one could play it better than the great man himself Bruce Bruce Willis! the other 3 films are great and i loved them all but none of them can compete with the original and the best. When he jumps of the building and it blows up wow that what awesome. Plus his famous line filled with 5 magnificent words that for me just makes the film what it is. Long live John Mclane and roll on a fifth movie i know that the man has still got it in him. The special effects are stunning and the action is full of suspense easily making this film one of the best action film of all time. Die Hard The franchise is simply genius!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
