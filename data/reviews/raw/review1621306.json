Not an easy movie to watch. It could have been better written. Too many clich√©s and stereotypes. The Johns and pimps that the movie dwells on are too obvious monsters. It might have worked better if some time had been spent on some of the less reprehensible \"bad\" characters. Part of the problem of real slave sex trade is that the victimizers are too often average Joes and indeed Janes, such as Carlyle\u0027s female assistant. The mini-series also largely avoids the issue that some of the victims get trapped into the trade knowing they are going to become prostitutes. That is to say they know they are going to be prostitutes, they just don\u0027t realize just how horrific the conditions are going to be. \n\nAs far as why the series was shot in Montreal, not New York, well, the movie business is a business after: it is cheaper to film in Montreal than New York. A scene not included on the DVD was shot a few blocks from my apartment. The train station where Sorvino lets Girard go is very likely the Montreal West AMT station. Montreal is used as location for New York City, Washington, D.C. (the brothel), Newark, and Manila (the port scenes at the end at least).", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
