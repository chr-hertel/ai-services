Right from the get go you see Parker\u0027s jack of all trades tendencies. Parker shows his video editing skills, his technological savvy (his auto-opening locker, compact monitors, buzzer to help Mikey cheat on a test, etc), ticket salesman, and keen ability to weasel his way through any situation. Mikey is a little different in this episode as he normally is suave with the ladies whereas here he requires Parker\u0027s assistance. Shelley shows her face as the evil sister out for her brothers destruction and Kubiac threatens to do the destructing of Parker. Milla Jovovich makes an appearance as the love interest (looking faaaantastic at that). I\u0027d definitely recommend that if you\u0027re going to watch PLCL for the first time, or if you haven\u0027t seen it since the early 90\u0027s then you should watch this episode first.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
