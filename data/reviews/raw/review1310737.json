This show is trying to say that most white people are completely ignorant and think that blacks are mysterious beings. It is also trying to say that all blacks feel oppressed and think saying the N-word is okay. Only ignorant people and rappers think that\u0027s okay.\n\nAside from all that Bruno is an actor. He is listed as being on Baywatch and other shows. I was wondering why he was the only person on the show so determined not to listen to the other side.\n\nThe producers of this show are exploiting a lot of buried tension. Don\u0027t let them. Watch \"Crash\" for a fair look at race issues on all sides. After all their are lot of other people in America besides blacks and whites - and they ALL have issues." }
