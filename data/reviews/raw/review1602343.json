Sometimes that\u0027s a great thing, but every time and it\u0027s just a cop-out. This show never fell into that trap. Sadly, it was probably compared too much to X-files and never developed a following--perhaps simply because former \"X-philes\" (such as my husband and I) had given up on the predecessor from the very frustrations I mentioned. \n\nThe opening titles were also the best of any show I can remember. Not only would we actually watch them, but sometimes rewind and watch them twice. Wish it were on DVD.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
