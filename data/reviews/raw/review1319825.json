Douglas is Great \" We have serious problem and we need serious people to solve them\"... J. Fox is great in this film as well. Along with Michael Sheen. I highly recommend this film to anyone who like politics movies. I love these types of movies ones that have a good plot and background The director who made this movie should do a sequel to it like for the elections and the 2nd terms and him and Syd getting married. I am thinking that a sequel to this film with all the original people would be very cool to see. I also like Jaine who was the personal aide to the president, she did a very good job in this movie, it a lot of work to be a personal aide to the president i would assume.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
