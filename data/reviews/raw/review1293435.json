This was Auh-nulled Schwarzenegger during his early days.\n\nBefore \"The Terminator...\" Before \"Jingle All The Way...\" Before he became the governor of California...\n\nHe starred...in very not-well-known films. This movie was one of them. I know \"Pumping Iron\" was another such example, but this review focuses on \"Hercules in New York.\" I don\u0027t want to give out too much detail; I just want y\u0027all to go watch this movie so that you, too, can experience the excitement that are known as...early Auh-Nauld Schwarzenegger movies!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
