It has like a thousand protagonists, and a thousand story-lines and uses a thousand of cinematographic tools... and in the end, there is not a protagonist nor a storyline nor a visual language. just like eating too much chocolate, still you won\u0027t regret about doing so. Must see... i guess not like it\u0027s for everybody. Characters, through a lot, are well developed, and kind on funny. the only real complain i have about this movie is that the whole baby thing, doesn\u0027t make sense at all... you\u0027ll see why.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
