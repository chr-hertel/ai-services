I\u0027ve read a couple of reviews that have called it the definitive film of the subject of abortion - I completely agree. I\u0027ve never seen anything so complex, complete and emotionally wrenching as this epic work. It stayed with me long after the screening. In fact, roughly 10 days have passed since I saw the film and it continues to haunt my thoughts. I weeped at the end. My only criticisms are it\u0027s length (far too long) and it\u0027s use of music, which often bordered on excessive and manipulative. But, those are relatively small concerns when weighed against the film\u0027s many positives. \n\nI LOVE documentaries and have seen nearly every major work produced in the past 20 to 30 years (as well as not so major films). \"Lake of Fire\" may well be my favorite - I\u0027m still deciding if any of the other films I\u0027ve loved delivered the same unrelenting, yet profoundly emotional punch to the gut that this one did.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
