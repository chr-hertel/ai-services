The film opens with a young man masturbating upon the orders of his director, from here on in the tone is set for what is, a bonkers, yet highly entertaining picture.\n\nThe plot revolves around the sexual adventures of gay director Pablo Quintero and his transsexual sister, Tina, her struggle with men and the duty of bringing up a young daughter who she fathered when she was a he!, still with me?. Into their lives comes Antonio Benitez, he\u0027s sexually fascinated with Pablo but gets his nose put out of joint upon learning of Pablo\u0027s love of another guy called Juan, things are about to get darkly unnerving.\n\nLaw Of Desire is stylish and full of tricky eccentricities, it\u0027s also very much in your face with its blatant urge to be seedy, however it\u0027s backed up by wonderful performances from Antoino Banderas {Benitez}, Carmen Maura {Tina} and Eusebio Poncela {Pablo}, whilst it\u0027s director is clearly a talent that was, at this time in his life, making films with attitude and a devil may care spirit. 7/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
