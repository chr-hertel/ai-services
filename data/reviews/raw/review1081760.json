All those little tap dancing Aussie all cute and tapping for a cause. All the drama, dead mom, dead brother, pregnant semi-girlfriend by brother, dad against his tapping, and a cynical instructor. i enjoyed it very much and would watch it again if i were to see it on. I think the idea behind the movie was very original...very funny at times. I particularly enjoyed comments about \"poofters\" and \"root\"." }
