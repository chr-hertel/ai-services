Nicholls, a man of remarkable resume (he worked with Robert Altman several times and therefore, knows what makes a great ensemble drama). Tim Robbins\u0027 ode to theater, the passion for arts (acting, in particular), freedom of speech and the price you have to pay for believing and living for it (art vs. politics), is an underrated mosaic of some very exquisite personalities (Orson Welles, Nelson Rockefeller, Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, John Houseman, Hazel Huffman, among others) that are, one way or another, involved with a musical play that\u0027s about to be closed down for being \"communist\", in 1936\u0027s New York. Nicholls (who has a cameo as George Zorn) said that most of the actors worked almost for free, out of friendship for Robbins and love for theater, and that \"Cradle Will Rock\"\u0027s poor reception at the box-office/critics, is the main reason why Robbins hasn\u0027t directed another movie since then. That\u0027s a shame, since this is even better than his previous directorial efforts (\"Bob Roberts\" and \"Dead Man Walking\"), which were much easier films. It\u0027s true you have to know at least a little bit about the people portrayed here in order to fully appreciate/understand the film, and movies like this don\u0027t usually become blockbusters, but the fact that \"Cradle Will Rock\" was ignored altogether and seems quite forgotten is really sad. The ensemble cast is one of the best I\u0027ve ever seen - Emily Watson, Bill Murray, Vanessa Redgrave, Joan Cusack, Cherry Jones, John Turturro, Susan Sarandon, John Cusack, Cary Elwes, Angus Macfadyen, Paul Giamatti, Bob Balaban, Hank Azaria, Jack Black, Philip Baker Hall, among others - and the screenplay is Altmanesque tapestry at its best. Hopefully, this film will be discovered in a not so distant future, and get the acclaim it deserves. 10/10." }
