After a successful mission, Kit finds himself being placed in a team headed by his father, his father that hes grown up hating and has a lot of resentment towards.\n\nWhile trying to bring down the biggest drug lord in Hong Kong, it appears Fit has been tempted by the dark side, unable to resist the lure of the money he needs to help support his pregnant wife (Gil from Twins).\n\nAs I said this movie is watchable, the story wraps up neatly with everyone having redeemed themselves in one way or another.\n\n3/5 ***" }
