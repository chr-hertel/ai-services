OK, I can understand why. The movie going audience today expects humor, action, special effects... and no, nature can not offer the same breath taking effects as computer technicians at major Hollywood studios can, but if you\u0027d stop and think (which isn\u0027t one of the strongest points of the average movie going population now-a-days) about it, you\u0027d see the beauty of it.\n\nThe shots are excellent and the comments are kept down to a minimum, so you can enjoy and experience the wildlife in one of the harshest climates in the world.\n\nNo, this movie isn\u0027t about environmental change. It does show a very fragile environment and yes, due to human induced climate changes this balance can break, but that\u0027s about it (on the environmental issue). It tries to show all the glory of the wildlife. It doesn\u0027t explain or tell you about it, it shows you and you need to deduct (so if you have no knowledge about wildlife in the first place, no curiosity about anything that\u0027s not chip powered - you will be disappointed).\n\nRemember the grand documentaries about the wild life in Africa? This one is actually better. The camera work is remarkable and if you are interested you will learn quite a lot from behavior (for instance: how snoring can kill a pray). Also the natural light shows of the various animals you get to see in the underwater and under-ice world are remarkable. I\u0027ve never before seen how an octopus lures it\u0027s pray instead of catching it and so forth.\n\nBut as I claimed before - this one is for nature lovers only, the rest better avoid this (god forbids they\u0027d become environmentally aware).", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
