I have to say that I was a little scared to see this film because of the fact that they (the screenwriters) had to cut down an enormous book into a very short script. Well they did it. The movie is absolutely amazing! Steven Kloves did such a great job adapting the book to the film. As of now the Goblet of Fire is by far the best Potter film released: the acting was very well done by the main trio and as well as the adult cast (Snape was particularly humorous) and the way the Mike Newell brought his experiences to the movie was amazing. It is certainly a lot darker in this film and I loved it. All in all a must see by any fan of the book!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
