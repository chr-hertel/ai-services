Having just done a web search there is little material available \u0026 it seems to have become something of a lost movie. Octavia is a blind girl who has lived in a protected environment. She has not experienced much of life. One day a guy on the run from the law breaks into her world, kidnaps her \u0026 takes her on a trip that will broaden her horizons...... Don\u0027t want to say more about the plot as I don\u0027t want to spoil the film for anyone who tracks it down - also its so long ago I may be wrong about a few details.... What I strongly remember is the dreamlike quality of the film that gave it some individuality (\u0026 Octavias sad monologues) \u0026 the almost religious irony of the plot - fans of \"Lets Scare Jessica To Death\" would probably get a similar vibe from this one. Hope some distribution company \"rediscovers\" this one for DVD release.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
