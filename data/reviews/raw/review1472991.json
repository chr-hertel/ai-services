Costa-Gavras\u0027 script (co-written with Jean-Claude Grumberg) is tight and stimulating.\n\nI really hope to see this movie in theatres soon for every one to enjoy.\n\nTerrific final cameo with Aznavour!\n\nCongratulations guys.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
