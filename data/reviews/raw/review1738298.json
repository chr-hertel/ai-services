If you have any doubts in the back of your head about seeing it forget them all and just watch it! really funny one liners, from Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti, along with the chemistry they both have with Monica Bellucci is great! but especially the chemistry between Clive and Monica, talk about hot. The action is off the hook! it doesn\u0027t stop, your either laughing or wow\u0027ing at the awesome gun scenes or the fighting. But if you have seen this film you\u0027ll know what I\u0027m talking about when i say the word \u0027Carrot\u0027 forget about what bugs bunny did with a carrot what Clive Owen can do with a carrot is much better, you\u0027d never of thought how dangerous a carrot can be. You have to see this film, Clive Owen shows he can really kick arse. But you\u0027ll always remember after watching this, NEVER trust anybody with a carrot. It\u0027s a classic take your brain out, and enjoy.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
