And something else, couldn\u0027t they make the war last a bit longer? Homer said it lasted 10 years not a couple of days! Not to mention other major differences from what Homer wrote: 1: Agamemnon is killed! 2. Menelaos is not only killed, but he\u0027s killed by Ektor. 3. Ector\u0027s family escapes from troy with the help of Achileas(who actually should\u0027t be there because he\u0027s killed before troy is taken from some kind of backdoor. Well all i have to say is that i should have heard my sister and never watched that movie", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
