To be honest the less you know about the story, the better otherwise it will ruin your enjoyment \n\nThe acting is excellent, I would say it really is Eva Green\u0027s movie, she shines throughout the movie with a rather difficult role and is absolutely beautiful. Sam Riley and Ryan Philippe are very good too although they have a little less material to play with. \n\nI think it\u0027s going to be hard sell as it is unlike anything I have seen, and if they try to market it as an action/sci fi movie, it will be very misleading but I still definitely recommend it if you\u0027re looking for something a bit different.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
