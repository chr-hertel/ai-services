American student Jessica Harper arrives at a German dance academy in a raging thunderstorm. The headmistress - Joan Bennett - is a little more than weird. The school is full of young girls and Jessica begins to notice strange things and hear strange sounds. What\u0027s really going on at the school? Some flying bats and falling maggots later she finds out after she does some detective work. Directed by Argento in a jarringly abrasive style, Suspiria has gaudy sets and a strange irritating musical score by \"The Goblins.\" Suspiria has its creepy moments and the barbed wire scene is especially disturbing. You won\u0027t fall asleep during this film." }
