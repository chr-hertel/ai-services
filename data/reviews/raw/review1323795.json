I really liked how we saw Catherine Zeta-Jones do more action and get into the movie better. Adrian Alonso played the son of Zorro with great Zorro like comedy and action.\n\nThis movie had great action and passion. The villain\u0027s idea to take over the world was great.The bar of soap was a genius plan but Zorro wouldn\u0027t let that happen.\n\nI really thought that the would not get back together and it was a wonderful movie for the family.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
