But after hearing that Steven Spielberg directed it, I wanted to see it immediately. I made a smart choice. This movie is rich in emotion, storytelling, and history because of the author\u0027s background. Another truly marvelous thing in this movie is Christian Bale\u0027s performance. He breaks your heart as you watch it. It was another one of those movies where I was emotionally devastated when I saw it; it\u0027s right up there with \"Rent,\" and \"E.T.\" Now, it surprised me when I learned that it didn\u0027t do well in theaters because people weren\u0027t use to Spielberg\u0027s transition into drama. But man! I don\u0027t understand how anyone could be disappointed in this. It\u0027s an incredible film and it will remain incredible for as long as the world is here to see it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
