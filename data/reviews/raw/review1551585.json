Rocky IV was bad and Rocky V was just horrible and a terrible note to end the acclaimed series on.\n\nThis movie may have been made 10 years too late but it is the perfect end to the Rocky Series.\n\nI laughed when I heard this was being made. I guess you never know until you see the movie.\n\nThe story goes back to the basics. It focuses on Rocky\u0027s life after the death of Adrian, his son\u0027s jealousy of living in the Shadow of his father, and Rocky\u0027s sad life running a restaurant where he tells patrons about his past glory.\n\nRocky is granted a license and gets an exhibition fight against Mason \"The Line\" Dixon who is 33-0 with 30 KOs and never has gone the distance.\n\nEveryone things the exhibition is a joke and HBO boxing analyst Larry Merchant comments this should be called an Execution instead of an exhibition.\n\nI will not comment on the fight but I think anyone could guess that Rocky doesn\u0027t get knocked out early or get beat soundly. Does he win or lose? You will have to see the film or ask someone else as I don\u0027t want to ruin the ending.\n\nThis is a good movie. I give a 7 out of 10. I considered an 8 out of 10 but since this is the sixth film and most of the territory has been covered, I had to drop it a point. However, if you like the Rocky Franchise or sports films, underdog films, and such then this is a must see.\n\nAnd it was refreshing to hear the crowd cheering Rocky, Rocky!
