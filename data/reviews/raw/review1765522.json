But Rudi goes to Spain to fulfill his dream there, leaving his Finnish girl friend Kati in Cologne in exchange for a Spanish woman. Jan makes the best of it, Kati becomes his girl friend and they turn the pub into a Spanish restaurant. However at the opening day they hear that Rudi never payed taxes and for this reasons everything will be distrained if they cannot pay 25.000 . Angry Jan drives to Spain to find Rudi...\n\nI expected more to be honest. The movie needs quite some time to really catch your attention (about half an hour), as it proceeds it\u0027s not bad, quite nice at the end, but nothing that has to be seen. Well, there are good actors, nice music and nice cinematography, so I asked myself what is it lacking and why? I think it would have needed just more dialogues. Well, there are excellent movies that come along without much talk, but while some of these movies (like some Wim Wender movies) are full of philosophy and poetry, this movie often only has to offer nice images and nice music. Director Peter Lichtefeld can do a lot better. Need a proof? Watch Zugvögel. \n\nHowever, at the end I really enjoyed the movie and would have liked it to continue, it really is better at the end, but that \"turn\" came to late to make it a really good movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
