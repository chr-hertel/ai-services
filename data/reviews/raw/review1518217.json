It\u0027s circa 1945 so nobody\u0027s packing heat. Walter Breenan is the town vet and mortician, but looking and talking different than I was use to. Marvin \u0026 Borgnine play their usual bad guy roles. The film is the first in my memory where a one-armed man beats the crap out of a regular fella (see also Lonely Are the Brave where Bill Raisch- later the one-armed man in the Fugitive gives Kirk Douglas a whooping).\n\nTracy is excellent as a man on a noble but uncertain mission to learn about the death of a Japanese man he is some how connected to. There\u0027s really a lot going on here about responsibility and courage- it seems to me to harken back a bit to High Noon. Robert Ryan preparing to play Wyatt Earp\u0027s enemy is good as a calm, normal psycho. Note that John Ericson and Ann Francis were or shortly did marry- not incest. The lesson here is when you travel to a town like Black Rock come by car and have the driver wait.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
