This show is great. If you ever watched Boogie Nights, Dazed and Confused, and felt the pure excitement and giddiness that comes with hearing Captain and Tenille, this show is for you. And, when I say \u0027feel\u0027 pure excitement, I mean it. The sexual tension is off the charts for cable, and it keeps you wanting more...and more. Two thumbs up. The cast is spectacular. Tom is SO HOT, and Janet - well, as a woman you realize how NOT to behave. Keep \u0027em coming.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
