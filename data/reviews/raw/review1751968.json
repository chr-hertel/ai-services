Check. Badly misjudged \u0027modern\u0027 youth speak dialogue? Check. Basically the same story every week? Check. The worst baddie in British television history? Check. A total lack of wit, drama, humanity or fun? Check. Dreadful dreary writing full of clich√©? Check. A great English myth defiled and debased for the 21st Century? Check. Makes even Kevin Costner look competent? Yikes but, er, check. Loved the nation over by 7 year olds? Checkity check.\n\nThe big difference between this and Dr Who (which occupies the same slot on BBC1) is this: Dr Who is family entertainment, because it doesn\u0027t treat the audience like idiots and thus adults can watch too. Anyone over the age of 10 will feel their intelligence is being insulted by this unspeakable dreck. Still, as I say, the kids won\u0027t mind, but it\u0027s got to go down as a missed opportunity.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
