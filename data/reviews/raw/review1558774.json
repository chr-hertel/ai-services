The movie bridges generation gaps and leaves you feeling good at the end. The characters are interesting, realistic, warm, likable, and you can relate to them. The sets are colorful and interesting eye-candy. The dialog is believable and the family is functional. It\u0027s difficult to not want to go out for Mexican food afterwords or better yet go into the kitchen, with friends and family, to enjoy the experience together. There is a fun twist toward the end which adds interest and a good laugh. Fun, safe, wholesome and well done.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
