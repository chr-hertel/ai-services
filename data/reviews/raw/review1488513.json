My boys, ages 8 \u0026 12, were entertained and subjected to life lessons all at the same time. I especially loved the way the film bridged the gap between generations. There are still a few things that teenagers can learn from the older generation! It is amazing how much you can learn about your true self when faced with a challenge. There are not enough films produced anymore that are not violent and do not contain inappropriate language for children. I applaud the writers and cast for keeping family values first and foremost. \n\nThe scenery will make you want to grab your canoe and take your family out camping!\n\nThank you for providing a film that we can add to our library and proudly watch as a family!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
