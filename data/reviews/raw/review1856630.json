An enigmatic villain, and the under-Britain he inhabits, is set against a story of corrupt policeman: there\u0027s certainly promise in the premise. Unfortunately, the acting isn\u0027t brilliant (Steven Robinson as the journalist is particularly poor) and the direction relies too much on the soundtrack to insert some otherwise missing emotion. The real problem is that the story seems abbreviated; a succession of events enticingly set out but never fully elaborated; what\u0027s left is perfunctory, a barely illustrated outline. It\u0027s a shame, as I can believe there was potential here.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
