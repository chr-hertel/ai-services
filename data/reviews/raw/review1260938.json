The mistakes in illumination makes difficult to give a higher grade. But the story and the way to narrate it are trapping in a lot of times of the movie. The \"semi-open\" end could not conform to the audience. In stories like this, we want to know what happen later. But in the other side let it to the imagination is a good choice to make it perdurable in the audience mind. The cast is great. Actuation is a good surprise. The script is good. Direction does not give as nothing new but result is good. The movie is funny. I insist... is a good try. This filmmaker has a big future. I hope that big companies give him a hand to make more movies in future. \"Ma√±ana te cuento\" confirms that is possible to do a good movie without much money.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
