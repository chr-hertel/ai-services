Heats 1 and 2 did actual scent work. lots of objects all the same and the dog had to pick the one that had the owners scent on it. very difficult and most did really well.\n\nheats 3 \u0026 4 ............well it was just a game of \u0027fetch\u0027!!! ONE wallet in a trouser leg, shouldn\u0027t they have had four wallets and one with the owners scent (similar to the ball game or toiletry bag game?) and heat 4 !!! what was that ? fetch three toys, thats not scent work thats just \u0027go fetch\u0027 !! \n\nthe agility is fantastic and the dancing is as camp as Christmas.\n\n2nd series should be on the cards but with a little bit more equality across the regions.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
