For example, assuming the audience is going to sit through a painfully slow opening in order to \u0027see what happens\u0027 is a mistake of many first time directors. Lazing on \u0027beautiful\u0027 camera angles, longing \u0027deep\u0027 looks by the actors, and a score that rambles, the film never really gets going and worst of all, doesn\u0027t wrap up - leaving many open ended questions and a feeling one has just wasted the afternoon.\n\nAdding insult to injury is the endless prattle by the director about non-substantive silliness in her director\u0027s commentary track. It doesn\u0027t matter that the acting was \u0027amazing\u0027 or that the look was deep, where\u0027s the story? What\u0027s the point? The director forgot her audience or assumed they cared about her, and went on some trek to find herself! And while in places there are admirable qualities to the film making, overall isn\u0027t the idea to make money and boost the careers for everyone involved by making a good, sale-able product? \n\nI never heard of this film when it came out. If I had invested in it I would be more than a little annoyed. I can only assume her studios (there were three) have money to burn for (very) expensive therapy. \n\nShe must have a fantastic agent.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
