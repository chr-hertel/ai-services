As in all of his films, Tokyo is the stage, and he populates them with his usual team of actors. Think of the professional stability of Ingmar Bergman, Woody Allen, or John Waters, but Japanese. Ozu concentrates on small moments made meaningful. Unlike the quiet, black and white drama \"Tokyo Story\", this later film (in color) is a gentle comedy about how people build the character of each and every day with the smallest of gestures Â– which is this case is brought to our attention by two small brothers who decide to go \"on strike\" insisting that their Father get a television for the household. It\u0027s a loving, funny, and forgiving look at how silly we all can be." }
