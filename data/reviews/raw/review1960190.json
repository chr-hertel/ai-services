Give away the ending at the beginning, and ignore the excellent character development of the book? They even dumbed-down the puzzle of the message from the builders. That\u0027s an excellent way to trash a great story. I expected much better from Walden Media, who did such a superb job with \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,\" and Playtone (you just dropped a notch in my esteem, Mr. Hanks). Caroline Thompson should be ashamed of herself. Why would she do so much to change a good story? My daughter, who loved the book so much she read it aloud to us, has warned all of her friends to avoid the movie. Hope they lose their shirts on it. The only positive note is that the acting was very good, the set design excellent. Too bad the story ruined the whole thing.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
