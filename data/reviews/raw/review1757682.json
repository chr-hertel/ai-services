But all of these things and more make a good horror film and if this is the pioneer, then this has to be one of the greatest horror films ever made.\n\nThis film also has some of my favorite things to see in film as well as gore and simplicity. Humor. Yes, humor. The scene at the end of the film with Ben thinking that he had just survived a zombie apocalypse wakes up and finds himself shot in the head. i cracked up. other scenes include when Ben beats up Barbara for being afraid, and also the classic \"they\u0027re coming to get you Barbara\" scene and when it actually turns out to be a zombie. an all time classic.\n\nonly classics can be parodied rightfully so, and Night.... has many parodies, most of them funny.\n\nOne of my highest recommendations. Ever.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
