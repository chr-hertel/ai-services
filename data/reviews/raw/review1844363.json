It\u0027s got everything in it, cavalry, outlaws, Indians and a damsel in distress. Lest no one be confused the damsel is Martha Hyer.\n\nMartha finds a wounded Dale Robertson, an outlaw separated from his men, and brings him back to the trading post where she endures a loveless marriage with Wendell Corey. But before the film is over they will have to put up with Apaches jumping the reservation and Robertson\u0027s men, none of whom are as scrupulous as he.\n\nFor an outlaw Dale\u0027s a little too good to be true. When the Indians kidnap young Dandy Curran, Hyer\u0027s son, Robertson gets his men involved in a scheme to rescue the lad that involves stealing army rifles and arming the Apaches. A big old no-no in any Hollywood western.\n\nPersonally while I think Martha\u0027s beautiful, one of the most beautiful women ever in films, I just can\u0027t swallow Dale risking all for her. If I was him, I\u0027d have kept on riding.\n\nThe cast performs well, certainly Robertson is no stranger to the Hollywood west. But the film\u0027s just a tad bit too unreal for my taste.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
