I would rate it as good as the best modern series around, such as Prison Break and 24, and better than Lost in my opinion. Taken in the context of the time, 1973-76, this UK television series still has an edge over same time US series. This particular episode left me wondering why American TV and Film productions cannot develop stories that have such great potential in the plot AND actually live up to it? There is enough tension and turns here to make the most jaded viewer take notice. When was the last time a slow-paced and languid story still left you on seat\u0027s edge? That takes a GOOD PLOT, SUPERB ACTING, WELL-DONE DIRECTION AND EDITING! Things sorely lacking in modern thrillers that rely upon sudden shock, loud noise and music, and grisly gore effects to terrify an audience. In those you can find time to go to the restroom and not miss anything or care, in this thriller, you will not want to leave at all. Do yourself a favor and pick up the DVD of the complete series available from UK sellers on ebay and other places, and give your Hitchcock series and Twilight Zone tapes a rest, for this is the equal to them." }
