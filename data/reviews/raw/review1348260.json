The film flat-out isn\u0027t scary. It\u0027s not creepy. It just walks you from locale to locale and trots out monsters from the games, but doesn\u0027t at all deliver on the feel. And the entire ending is just terrible. Where was all the subtlety and downright horror of the games? It\u0027s been replaced with just gore and unnecessary CGI, such as the unnecessary bugs. Plus, apart from Cybil shooting one monster, no one fights back in the entire movie. Especially disappointing was Brookhaven Hospital, which could and should have been terrifying but turned out to be just another place. If they do make a sequel, let\u0027s hope someone else writes and directs it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
