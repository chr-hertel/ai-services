I though this movie was witty, funny and an all around good story. The casting was perfect and I really enjoyed the performance by the young Joseph Cross and Evan Racheal Wood...I am looking forward to seeing them in future presentations.\n\nAnyways, concluding my thought on the film it was an outstanding and under credited movie. Our society these days is losing touch with our creative aspect of film. We are focusing more on effects and action and shying away from in depth characters and a solid storyline. In my book \"Running with Scissors\" deserves at least a 9.0 with a \"Best Picture\" nomination.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
