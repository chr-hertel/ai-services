I didn\u0027t watch the first season of American Idol, but I have friends who did, and heard all about it. I love Kelly\u0027s voice, and Justin\u0027s... not to mention Anika Noni Rose, who played Kaya, and was also in Dreamgirls. This was by no means a theatrical feat of any kind. However, I think you know exactly what you\u0027re going to get if you watch this movie. I watched it for the music and the light-heartedness, and that\u0027s what I got. I was entirely entertained, even though this movie IS 5 years old and Justin Guarini has apparently disappeared. The plot gets a zero; a five year old could almost write the script. But I loved \"Anytime\", and give Justin\u0027s and Kelly\u0027s voices a 10 together.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
