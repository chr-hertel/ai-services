The story\u0027s very sly and just when you think you\u0027ve figured it all out, it slips away from you, it\u0027s like trying to hold on to a wet bar of soap. Van Looy\u0027s greatest accomplishment is avoiding the sin most of the movies in this genre make: neglect the characters. Without losing pace, we manage to really get to know the pawns in our chess game, and as each one\u0027s motivations start to sink in, even the most unlikely become suspect.\n\nWe see here assembled a who\u0027s who of Belgian stars, the dream team cast, even the smaller roles are given to top class actors (Jan Decleir). The film\u0027s lighter on it\u0027s feet than Van Looy\u0027s previous, we (on first sight) get to deal with far less tortured souls, which makes some room for humorous intervals, I fear a lot of these will get lost in translation.\n\nAs in all stories, but even more so in plot-driven thrillers, the end\u0027s the most important part. It delights me that they didn\u0027t choose a ridiculous, nonsensical ending as so much postmodern thrillers shamelessly do these days. I can\u0027t give anything away of course, but I for one didn\u0027t see it coming at all and yet it adds up when you replay previous scenes in your head.\n\nGo see it, it merits national and international attention.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
