Casino Royale had raised the bar a bit but this sent it firmly plunging back to the bottom. The plot seemed to be all over the place, but this could in part have been down to the appalling direction of the action sequences - \u0027let\u0027s take the shot in as tight as possible and wave the camera around, that way we\u0027ll get a good sense of intensity!\u0027 Erm, no - people will just wonder what the hell\u0027s going on and start to feel sick. It was all, well, just a mess and it\u0027s a shame that, although they are undoubtedly trying to pull some of the success of the Bourne series into Bond, they\u0027re failing so miserably. Get a decent director at the helm and not someone who looks they they\u0027ve just come straight from a music video.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
