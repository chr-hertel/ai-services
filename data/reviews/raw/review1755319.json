Sure enough, there is a lot of good in the movie. The acting standard all around is high although the script did not lend much to Amanda Peet\u0027s character. Bobby Coleman, in particular, shines as a child who must be both eccentric and yet connect with the audience. The script has some clever moments, but a lot has been done before and been better handled and a couple of points in the movie drag. In spite of this, I was really looking forward to see how the whole story would turn out, and I am sad to say it left me hanging. Not so much plot-wise, but certainly emotionally and it\u0027s then the clich√©s that were masked by some good acting and direction reveal themselves. I\u0027ll put it this way. The whole audience remained in the seats for a full 30 seconds when the credits rolling desperately blinking and thinking, \"That\u0027s it?\"\n\nIn conclusion, this is a lighthearted movie with great potential that falls flat on the last laps.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
