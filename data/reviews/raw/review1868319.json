Call it a guilty pleasure if you will, or merely evidence of my incipient senility. This isn\u0027t a movie for middle aged men. (Who am I kidding? I could only be considered middle aged if I expected to live to be several decades past the century mark!) Still, it was sweet and charming with a disarming innocence that was totally refreshing.\n\nThe plot has been more than adequately synopsized. And yes, it is formulaic in its way. Still the performances are excellent all around. You pretty much know what will happen - or at least you know what you\u0027d like to see happen, and the script doesn\u0027t disappoint. Everyone is excellent. Amanda Bynes (who I\u0027d never heard of before this film) more than carries the production on her amazingly mature shoulders. Others have noted that Colin Firth as her dad is \"wooden\", but that\u0027s part of the point of the film. Even the minor characters are all pitch perfect. The actors inhabiting even the smallest parts make their screen time memorable.\n\nIf you\u0027re not too cynical, this is an enjoyable, charming film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
