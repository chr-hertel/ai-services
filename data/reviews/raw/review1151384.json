I\u0027m showing this movie to everyone i know and i highly recommend it. The visual and audio aspects of the movie were very well done. the only thing i did not like was the techno music they would occasionally play, but that\u0027s a small issue that doesn\u0027t matter. Whoever the director is, you can be sure that i will follow their career and movies he or she makes in the future. Please, if you see it, rent it or buy it. Another Hispanic/Mexican/Spanish movie i would recommend is \"killing words\", that is also a great movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
