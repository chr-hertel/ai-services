Simply put, it\u0027s the story of one young man\u0027s struggle to take it easy.\n\nThe title character is played by Matthew Broderick and, for me, that\u0027s where the problems start. I\u0027m not a Broderick fan at the best of times and here it\u0027s twice as bad since he\u0027s playing a character that I find it very difficult to like. I blame John Hughes\u0027s script for giving little or no justification of why Ferris is almost universally liked.\n\nFerris\u0027s pal Cameron (Alan Ruck) is a little more engaging but his girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) serves no discernible function other than that of eye-candy. Easily the best effort in the acting department comes from Jeffrey Jones who gives an iconic performance as the dean who\u0027s out to get Ferris.\n\nConsidering these characters, the story is unsurprisingly slight. The trio basically drive around town in a Ferrari and supposedly live life to its fullest, though in actuality doing little of consequence. Adding just a smidgen of depth to the proceedings is the introduction of a crisis that will force Cameron to decide if he\u0027ll finally start standing up to his father.\n\nThe direction by John Hughes (who was also the screenwriter) is well handled though not particularly remarkable. The soundtrack is a typical 80\u0027s melange, complete with Yello\u0027s soon-to-be-clich√© \"Oh Yeah\". I would say that the production values are solid but they\u0027re not going to turn the tide if you can\u0027t connect with the characters.\n\nIf you have fond memories of this film then I doubt that they\u0027ll be dashed by seeing it again but if you didn\u0027t see it back in the 80\u0027s then I wouldn\u0027t really recommend seeing it now.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
