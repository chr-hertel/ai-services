But having seen this, I can say that I was totally glued to the screen and not only just with Shah Rukh \"King\" Khan\u0027s performance but also with performance by Priyanka Chopra as \"Roma\" and Boman Irani as \"DCP DeSilva\" as well as OM Puri. It was also nice to see Chunky Pandey after a long time, even though it was only at the beginning. The fight sequences as well as the computer visual effects are worthwhile to watch.\n\nSunidhi Chauhan has also done a magnificent job of the re-mix of \"Yeh Mere Dil, Yaar Ke Deewana,\" which was originally sung by the evergreen Asha Bhonsle for Helen in the original. Farhan Akhtar has done an excellent job of this as have the musicians - Shankar Ehsan Loy.\n\nThe ending of this movie is different to the original and so since, Shah \"King\" Khan had said that if this \"Don\" is successful, then and only then a sequel would be considered. So watch out for the sequel of this.\n\nSomething of as a matter of interest here: Salim Khan of \"Salim - Javed\" is the father of actor Salman Khan, whose step mother is Helen(she\u0027s married to Salim Khan). Farhan Akhtar\u0027s father is Javed Akhtar of \"Salim - Javed\" - the duo who wrote the original \"Don.\"", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
