And the mondo-bizarre future begins.", "reviewBody": "The action unfolds in 2010, almost 15 years after the world has blown itself up, Only one missile born nuclear weapon is left, and whatever mutant survivor holds the Keys to its launch controls will have the power of ultimate obliteration. The world is threatened again!, Phillip and Marlowe  two guys trapped in a bomb shelter for more then a decade with nothing else but canned food and 1940\u0027s detective books  are the only hope. They\u0027ve got the keys, they\u0027ve also got the whole Punk District of Edge City after them! Life after the bomb is just one big blast! Loved the film, and great music Starring John Stockwell from \"Christine\" also with Michael Dudikoff from \"Bachelor Party\" , Michele Little From \"My Demon Lover\" and George Kennedy from \"the Naked Gun films\", All up I give it 8 out of 10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
