To satisfy my MMA urges I\u0027ve put myself through cheesy Bas Rutten flicks (The Eliminator and even The Vault), amazing documentaries (The Smashing Machine), and even rare Japanese flicks (Nagurimono). So this has been a long time coming. A well-made flick, with a well-known director and accomplished actors, this has to be good, right? Well, no, not really. But luck be true, REDBELT was a very good film.\n\nThe story follows a thoughtful Jiu Jitsu instructor who ends up running into some good luck. Unfortunately, it doesn\u0027t last long, and in order to set things right, he will need to cross examine himself and the people around him. Respect, honor, greed, back-stabbing and gratitude rule this film, turning it into an intriguing, emotional and entertaining movie.\n\nWith fantastic acting by most, smart, realistic writing, and some emotional scenes, REDBELT delivers an especially big wallop on the intimate side. \n\nThough, with hyper editing and jerky camera-work used for the MMA scenes, the movie tends not to work as well as I would have liked. For a knowledgeable MMA fan, you\u0027ll pick up on all the moves, but for someone who doesn\u0027t know about MMA and it\u0027s techniques, it may seem like a mess. \n\nHowever, the film is definitely not a mess. Yeah, the ending was a tad too unbelievable, and though the movie shines through it\u0027s writing and realistic situations, some scenes felt a little sappy. But the end of the ending was fantastic.\n\nRed Belt doesn\u0027t fail at being an action flick; it just succeeds more so at being an entertaining drama with an MMA theme. This is an easy movie to recommend, since it\u0027s easily recommendable to all people who believe in having good morals. \n\nThe movie would have been perfect if El Guapo was in it. ;)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
