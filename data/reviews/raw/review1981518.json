All the actors are democrats (shocking) and it was a cowardly attack against our brave soldiers. This movie made me sick. Tommy Lee Jones is a disgrace. Susan Sarandon is sickening. If I saw them in person, I\u0027d spit on them for spitting on our soldiers by implying they are all messed up on drugs and experience. Anti-American scum. I think anyone who was in this film should think twice about being in the United States and move to a country, like Iraq, since they obviously think values in that country are better than ours. This movie was absolutely dire and shocking and I can\u0027t believe anyone who claims to be American is happy that this has been shown around the world and condones how it depicts our brave soldiers. It made me irate.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
