Its wonderful! The violin-score on the beach for example is just absolutely magnificent! The artists on the score did a great job on this film, and so did Aaliyah (R.I.P) she was amazing as the Queen. Stuart is incredibly convincing at the role as Lestat. \n\nThat was All !\n\nhope you can use this for something :)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
