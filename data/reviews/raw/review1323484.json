Whatever happened to the great tradition of low budget barbarian films? Today you see try hard films with reasonable cgi effects but shockingly bad performances, and scripts that are usually anachronistic and too self aware (blame TV\u0027s Hercules and Xena for this?). The problem I think is the filmmakers of today take themselves too seriously. Make a low budget film and be proud of it, \u0027Ator\u0027 is not impressive on any technical front but it is sure as hell entertaining. This film isn\u0027t trying to be \u0027Conan\u0027 any more than a daytime TV soap is trying to be serious drama. it is what it is, if you can\u0027t deal with that then don\u0027t watch coz you just won\u0027t get it. If you can then you\u0027ll have a fun hour and a half.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
