Mini-Spoiler: For example when most of the Pound Puppies (except for Cooler and the Purries) are turned mean coursty of Mcnasty\u0027s Mean Machine, it takes one Colette\u0027s puplings to say to her that they love her just as she growling and about to hurt them to change her back, so Cooler notices this, say\u0027s it to her friend Reflex and then by the ringing of a bell, has Reflex saying to all the Pound Puppies by hugging and kissing them.\n\nSo if you want a good family film without the volenice to enjoy. Get this one.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
