Their HBO show is funny as hell and their album is awesome, not only as a comedy CD, but as a rock CD too. Jack Black usually kicks ass in most movies and I don\u0027t think it was necessarily his performance that hurt this film. This movie was just not funny at all. It was a major disappointment. I spent the whole movie waiting for the funny part to come, but it never did. The whole plot was completely pointless. (SPOILER WARNING) All they accomplished was getting a bong out of Satan\u0027s horn. Sooo stupid. Tenacious D is better than this and I think it is a shame that they had to misrepresent themselves to the world with this crappy movie. See Borat instead." }
