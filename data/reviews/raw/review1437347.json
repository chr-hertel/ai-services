One not particularly likable character. That\u0027s this episode\u0027s downfall. We have a woman that is haunted by an annoying ringer that won\u0027t shut up next apartment down. Of course she goes and asks around to find out why the person won\u0027t pick it up, and GASP! Nobody lives there, and GASP! the last person who did live there is now dead. The end is a bit stupid and the episode isn\u0027t anything special. You could see it coming from a mile away and the episode is too slow and ended up as a forgettable installment in my books.\n\nMy rating: Forgettable. 22 mins.
