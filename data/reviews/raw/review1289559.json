Brad Pitt handles the role of an annoying, obnoxious Austrian climber quite well. Other acting is fine. The story could have been riveting, but somehow, it misses - one never really understands or cares for the characters shown, and so the story, which could have been quite dramatic, fails to draw in this audience.\n\nBeautiful scenery and cinematography, a remarkably dramatic true story, important events that shaped the world that we live in - but I could not, try as I might, involve myself in this story. As an unabashed Brad Pitt fan (I consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation), I expected to *love* this flick - and yet, it left me cold.\n\nIt could be a failing within myself, but I tend to point toward the creative end of this movie - direction, scriptwriting, production, editing - somehow, they lost me. It\u0027s a shame, because it could have been wonderful.\n\nGood acting, dramatic story, beautifully shot - it should have been magnificent. It wasn\u0027t. Probably worth watching, just to make your own mind up on it - but don\u0027t expect too much, and perhaps you won\u0027t be as disappointed as I was. Mostly, it bored me.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
