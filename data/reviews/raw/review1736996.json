I think we all enjoyed it more for its \"Toronto-ness\" than for anything as dourly serious as \"identity politics\". It had the feel of our city, and the same goofiness that you would see in Strange Brew. Seeing the venerable Saeed Jaffrey as the God Krishna in a Leaf\u0027s goalie uniform had us rolling on the floor with laughter. And the same actor as the long-suffering postal clerk, to whom Krishna delivers the rarest Canadian stamp, but is unwilling to sell it either to satisfy his wife\u0027s craving for appliances or the government\u0027s pressure, is the Canadian Everyman in a nutshell." }
