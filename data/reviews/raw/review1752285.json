Maybe, but that doesn\u0027t mean it isn\u0027t entertaining.", "reviewBody": "I remember when I first heard about this movie. I was in high school and my friend was super-excited about some unknown movie he had seen at some random party in some other town. He was quick to show me the movie, and I gotta say, it was awesome.\n\nThe movie follows Connor and Murphy MacManus, Irish brothers living out in Boston. After a run-in with a couple of thugs from the Russian mob, the brothers come to the realization that they\u0027ve been given some kind of divine role as bringers of justice. From then on, they begin hunting down the mob scum of south Boston piece by piece with FBI agent Paul Smecker on their trail.\n\nYou can\u0027t watch this movie without noticing the fantastic casting choices. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus have perfect chemistry as brothers, and Willem Dafoe is the highlight of this flick. Even unknowns like David Della Rocco have great charisma and keep you cheering for the Saints. The fantastic actors in this movie are enough to make you overlook Ron Jeremy\u0027s appearance (though his acting was perfectly natural in the Sin Bin scene, hah). On top of a fantastic cast, I thought the story was well written and I loved Troy Duffy\u0027s method of revealing the events in nonlinear fashion. The investigations made for some of the best parts.\n\nThis movie has a great cast, cool action scenes, and humor. Honestly, I\u0027m not surprised that this film became some kind of cult classic. I noticed when I moved out and went to college in 2004 that everyone owned a copy of this movie, as if it was standard issue. I\u0027m not going to argue whether or not the movie is over-rated, because I feel it is. I wouldn\u0027t go so far as to say this movie is one of the best ever, but it\u0027s definitely entertaining and worth watching at least once. It definitely lives up to its hype.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
