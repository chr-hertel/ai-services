As a result of so many \"home runs\", lesser Disney toons (and that is definitely a category I would place this film in) appear dull and listless by comparison. If I had never seen BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, LITTLE MERMAID or PINOCCHIO, I might have loved BROTHER BEAR. But BROTHER BEAR comes up short compared to all these great Disney films on so many levels. The quality of the animation is decent but a definite step down, the story dull and preachy and the film offered no excitement or novelty. It\u0027s just another \"love the Earth\" film with a heavy-handed message. As for the songs....where there even songs? I don\u0027t recall any and I certainly didn\u0027t leave the theater humming any. Overall, this is just a time-passer and a film that looked more like it should have been released direct to video.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
