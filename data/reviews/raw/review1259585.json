Not only is this film funny but it is also a true romance like the \u0027Girl Next Door\u0027 but much funnier and entertaining. When i walked into the cinema to see it i was expecting a lot from it because it said it was done by the makers of American pie which was also a great film. The film was not too long to bore you like a lot of recent films have been like, but isn\u0027t too short too to leave you walking out disappointed, personally i think the timing/length of the film was perfect. I highly recommend this film if you want to see a true comedy or have laugh. i think its the best film out at the cinema today.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
