It\u0027s a shame then that this means many people are missing out on a fine programme due to ignorance and prejudice.\n\nWhile Russell Brand is often portrayed as a sex maniac, this often contrasts with intellectual musings and razor sharp comic timing. If you haven\u0027t read My Booky Wook, you won\u0027t be aware of the struggle he has got to this point.\n\nThen again (as witnessed here) he\u0027s not afraid to poke fun at himself. Reading from a school report about his \"unusual haircut\" and \"showing off\" he retorts \"That\u0027s my career!\"\n\nAs for the show itself, it sounds quite generic- host makes quips about old TV clips. Clive James, James Carr, Jo Brand and endless others have made this a genre, before Harry Hill effectively put his stamp on it.\n\nRussell Brand effectively interweaves the clips within a routine on numerous subjects eg family or pets. He veers from wild energy to bemusement to outright incredulity. His power comes from his unpredictability, making each episode both baffling and hilarious.\n\nSeriously, give Ponderland a chance and you\u0027ll see why he deserves his success.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
