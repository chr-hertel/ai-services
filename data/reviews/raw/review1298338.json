Top ten definitely.", "reviewBody": "I think the reason that this movie was not in the top ten or at least 20 was because of it being historically incorrect. But that is not what the top 250 movies of all time is about. Put aside the historical incorrectness and this movie is top ten. Yes, it is long but you can get by that. After all, it is very much worth it. The Battle at Stirling is one of the greatest battle scenes I have seen in any movie. Many war movies have stolen little things from this movie. For example, the \"Hold, Hold, Now\" in Gladiator. And there were others. This movie deserves to be top ten, just look at all the reviews. Historically incorrect should not put this movie in the 90s.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
