It was produced by RKO who made many of the best \"film noires\" during the 40s and early 50s.\n\nDirected by Jacques Tourneau, it contains all of the \"film noire\" characteristics. Its full of night scenes, dark brooding shadows, a \"femme fatale\", snappy ideologue, murder, mystery and plenty of double crosses.\n\nJeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum) is happily running a small gas station in Bridgeport, California and in love with local girl Ann Miller (Virginia Houston). One day from out of the past comes Joe Stephanos (Paul Valentine) looking for him. It seems that Jeff has a past. In any event, Jeff goes to see gambler/gangster Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas) who asks him to find his girlfriend Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer) who has shot him and absconded with $40,000 of his money. On the way Jeff explains to Ann about his past and that his real name is Markham.\n\nJeff undertakes the task and ultimately discovers Kathie in Acupulco where they become lovers and attempt to allude Sterling. Ultimately, Jeff\u0027s ex-partner Jack Fisher (Steve Brodie) finds them in San Francisco. Fisher confronts the couple and a struggle ensues between the men. During the scuffle, Kathie kills Fisher, and then the fun starts.\n\nKathie suddenly disappears. Jeff returns to Lake Tahoe where Sterling lives and is soon framed by him for the murder of Leonard Eels (Ken Niles) after being set up by his secretary Meta Carson (Rhonda Fleming). Kathie turns up in Sterling\u0027s company having gone back to him. After a few more double crosses and murders, Kathie and Jeff manage to get together again and.........\n\nBoth Mitchum and Douglas were just coming into their own at this time. The interplay between them and the \"femme fatale\" Greer is fun to watch. Former child star Dickie Moore appears as a deaf/mute who worked for Jeff at the gas station. Richard Web appears as Ann Miller\u0027s faithful beau who patiently awaits Jeff\u0027s downfall.\n\nRemade in 1984 as \"Against All Odds\" with Jeff Bridges, Rachel Ward and James Woods in the Mitchum, Greer and Douglas parts respectively. Jane Greer also has a small role in the later film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
