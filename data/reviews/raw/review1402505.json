The show is a combination of computer graphics, reenactments, and survivor and investigator interviews. The disasters include plane and train crashes, natural disasters, structural breakdowns, and terrorism. The episodes tend to be fairly recent disasters, going back up to about 30 years ago, but every so often they show older ones, like the Hindenburg.\n\nThis show has a good rewatchability factor, except National Geographic tends to replay many of the episodes too much and not show others. For example, the Mt. St. Helens and Columbia episodes are shown too often.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
