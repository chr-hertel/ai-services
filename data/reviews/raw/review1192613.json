Kurt Russell was magnificent and after watching Val Kilmer\u0027s performance I was almost crying. The thing I like about this western is that it is different to a lot of the westerns made especially before the sixties. I am not saying that those westerns a rubbish but I do not like the love themes and and the way they set up the romance between the main characters. In Tombstone I thought that it was a western with its own original ideas. With its amazing cast including amazing talented actors Michael Biehn, Sam Elliot and Charlton Heston this film is a must see not just for fans of westerns but also for fans of action movies and movies.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
