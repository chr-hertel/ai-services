And a binge-eating Dandelion Girl he left behind who gets involved. While there are many amusing visual touches and lines and I loved many of Kristen Chenoweth\u0027s quirks as the waitress Olive in unrequited love with Ned as well as her singing \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\", for some reason I found this a little off-putting compared with \"Pie-lette\". Maybe it\u0027s seeing Chuck so close to Ned that makes me a little more apprehensive since we know if he touches her again she\u0027s dead forever. At least some of that gets solved at the end. Loved seeing Emerson knitting and his results: a vest and gun holders! And the scenes with Young Ned and those frogs were also good. So while this wasn\u0027t as good as the first episode, I\u0027m still willing to give \"Pushing Daises\" a chance.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
