But, if you go in looking for Hannibal Lechtor, you won\u0027t be. You can\u0027t compare this movie to any other Hannibal movie. Different time-period, different setting, different actors......\n\nMy point is, the actor that played Hannibal did beautifully. It was very effective in scaring the ***** out of me! But, no, you can\u0027t compare Anthony Hopkins to Hanibal Rising. Totally different. \n\nAnd, yes, it was a total explanation as to why he turned out the way he did. \n\nI\u0027m waiting for the next one.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
