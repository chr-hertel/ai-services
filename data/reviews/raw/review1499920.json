To me anyways. I love the show. I was a little upset when he picked hoopz instead of new york because shes the one for him. But it looks like she will be the one on flavor of love 2 2006. Good luck Ney York I love you here in oak hill West Virginia. flav and her have so much in common and would be perfect for each other. She is herself all the time, and so is flav. She plays the game and knows how to win. Her mom is crazy, sorry new york, but she will go with want she wants because she is a strong woman. I cant wait to watch the show every day i watch to even see if there might be some reruns on or anything . luv ya lots flav and new york.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
