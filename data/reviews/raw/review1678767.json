In all honesty, (and only in my opinion), this film\u0027s lack of existence would have helped the series over-all. It was intended to tie up all of the loose ends, but personally, I think this film created more holes than it patched.\n\nFirst off... the actress of Jamie Lloyd in parts 4 \u0026 5 should have been played by Danielle Harris herself, IF the movie absolutely HAD to be made. Second, I\u0027m aware that the ending occurrence of Dr. Sam Loomis was in reality, unexpected, but... perhaps they could have went about announcing it a bit differently. I didn\u0027t really like the way that they let the audience know about it in the end. Also- as most of us that have seen it before know, the film introduces Jamie Lloyd\u0027s son, (which is obviously Michael Myers\u0027 \u0027grand\u0027-nephew, and therefore explains why Michael wanted him- because of his family/blood relation to him,), but it never offers any kind of follow-up to what ever happens to the baby.\n\nThe following sequel, \"Halloween: H20\" didn\u0027t provide any kind of information on Jamie\u0027s baby, or Jamie herself, yet featured what would be Jamie\u0027s biological brother, \"John\", as Laurie Strode\u0027s son. ...Which was a mistake on their part. (The writers of H20) To top all of that off, just the simple idea of Michael being involved in a cult is rather... disappointing. I think it\u0027s more enjoyable not knowing what\u0027s behind Michael\u0027s actions. It\u0027s better being kept in suspense and in wonder, rather than having it be explained. If they absolutely HAD to explain it, they could have at least made the viewer do some thinking to figure it out on their own.\n\nWith so many things wrong with this sequel, it\u0027s a wonder why I\u0027m giving it even a 3/10. I suppose that 3 can be divided into three parts: A) It at least HAS Michael in it, unlike Part III. B) It\u0027s at least a good stalker/slasher flick if you\u0027re dying of boredom. C) Dr. Sam Loomis\u0027 story is explained and the occurrence is made know, as opposed to what they could have done, and left it unknown, and that would have caused viewers and film-researchers to complain wildly. So those three things exist, which makes this film just above Halloween III, but it\u0027s still the worst sequel made with Michael involved.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
