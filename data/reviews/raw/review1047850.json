When the judge that sentenced him, offers him a way out, Steve suspects he has been set up but has no room to turn the offer down. So it happens then that Steve is married to Cheyenne  a fiery young woman, whose father\u0027s will states that she will inherit nothing unless she marries within so many days. With the papers signed, Steve is let out of jail with no knowledge of who his new wife is and quickly finds that he was not pardoned  only freed, so a posse of men are after him immediately. Steve gets offered a chance to get after his wife and claim his rights as her husband by sinister businessman Parnell and thus he sets of after her wagon train.\n\nDespite the trimmings, western setting and plotting, the basic story here is very much a simple case of \"man and woman dislike each other while the audience wonder if they will overcome differences and perhaps even fall in love\". The answer to this question is unlikely to have audiences on the edge of their seats but the film does just about manage to entertain even if it never really does anything that special or interesting. The story treads the usual path but has some humour, action and intrigue to make for a distracting affair that more of less does the job for an undemanding afternoon in on a wet weekend. Of course a lot depends on the chemistry between the stars in this sort of plot and unfortunately the delivery isn\u0027t good enough on that front.\n\nIt isn\u0027t that the cast are bad, because they are actually OK but this film could have been lifted greatly by some really sparkling chemistry and interaction between the two leads. Madison is fairly solid in the lead role and does do well with a slight swagger and wry grin; meanwhile Fleming is quite interesting but is never as sexual or as fiery as she needed to have been. The scenes the two share don\u0027t work that well either  the audience had to care for both characters and see genuine affection below the surface even in the most argumentative encounters and they can\u0027t manage to do that and just come off as, well, two b-movie stars playing opposite each other rather than anything convincing. Adams plays the usual b-movie villain with some relish but didn\u0027t make much of an impression on me I\u0027m afraid.\n\nThe end result of all these average ingredients is a b-movie that never really rises above par for the course at any point but just about has enough comedy and energy to provide distraction if you are in an undemanding b-movie mood." }
