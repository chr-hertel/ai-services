If running round corridors like a demented hack actor (farscape) and having the storyline and tech babble (Andromena)of a SF 101 was not bad enough the weirdos of planet Zonk rehashed this from the bowels of Kaptian Kirk! I suffered weeks of this dribble and still know not what was the point ?? \"And so say we all\". For crying out loud this was a fantastic opportunity to do some real guts and gore Sci-fi stuff, something we could all really look forward too watching once a week, to excite us, to fulfil our craving for the Alamo sense of last standings and to win against all odds, were victories were decisive, and Human kind ability to out smart Mega megabyte walking computers. It summed it all up for me, were the last scene when Voltare and his blonde sexual appliance were looking down at what i suppose was a crib with a baby in it ! i found my self saying aw lovely were the batteries go ? The bloody story had been half written the hard work had been done, the imagination was flashed in the 70s! All we wanted was for you to fill in the blanks, give more tech to what the Cylons were are is, Then Loads of action lots of Battle s and Stars on a Galactica scale !!! What we GOT ! Some pencil neck geek in a suit using clich√©s to death, as in the the always inconclusive annoying trying to be clever Xfiles, mixed with the over complicated story lines of Dune, not forgetting the, being beat nearly to a pulp then at the last minute win of, Rambo, Universal Soldier, etc. Please Next time if your going to to do another series of BS 2003 check with me first ! leave your suits at home stop worrying about the ad brakes and cliffhangers, and do it for the viewer, not just for your profits.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
