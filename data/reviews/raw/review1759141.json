Twists and turns guarantee enough suspense in this piece of jigsaw solving, plus there are some elements of a legal thriller, that make the plot a little bit more complex. Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling are really excellent but the whole cast seems to work properly, both in terms of involvement and rhythm. It\u0027s a cut above average thrillers and above stories based upon novels or famous trials, thank to the cast and the screenplay.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
