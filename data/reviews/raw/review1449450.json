Some of the child actors are okay but their powers and the whole back story is foggy. Despite they need to be trained at the Academy there was, for me, no good reason to care. Allen after doing \"Shaggy Dog\" (another runner up for worst of 06) shows that despite the god awful taste in film selections he is just doing it for the MONEY. So the next Allen flick that comes out don\u0027t expect some kind of descent film just expect Tim laughing it up on screen pulling ridiculous stunts like \"Zoom\". Despite the kids, probably who this mess was made for it is regrettable, despicable and down right dimwitted. *1/2", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
