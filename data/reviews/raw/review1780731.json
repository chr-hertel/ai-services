What better way for them to come together?\" ~Brian \n\nWhile this episode does have a lot going on with every character for once and is sometimes a little too cluttered, it was just incredible. Randy Harrison finally has his time to shine here as Justin when the kids at school and the teachers continue calling him names. He teams up with Daphne after some big words of encouragement from Deb to form a GSA, or Gay/Straight Student Alliance. There are quite a few amazing scenes, my favorite being the pitch for the GSA that Brian gives Justin while the both of them are completely naked. Lindsay and Melanie finally talk again, but there are more problems than it first appears. Also, Michael and David go through problems when Michael gets angry at David for paying for everything. Once again a great soundtrack and a great ending, Queer as Folk just keeps getting better and better.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
