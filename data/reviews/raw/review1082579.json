M.Wens is Steeman\u0027s Hercule Poirot.But he is not the star of the movie.Here the detective takes a back seat to the hero(es) played by a sensational Louis Salou .Salou portrays two brothers ,Lucien and Freddy Dolo:the first one is a well-meaning bourgeois with wife (Marie Déa) ,the second a shady person who disappeared in Africa 10 years ago and who suddenly reappears when his nice brother begins to be suspected of having done away with him.\n\nLouis Salou\u0027s performance is remarkable,because,with his voice,his swagger,and abetted by a masterful editing,he succeeds in making us believe there are TWO different men.A brilliant variation on the Stevenson \"Doctor Jekill and MrHyde\" theme,it grabs the audience and leaves it panting for breath in the last third.\n\nLike in Hitchcock\u0027s \"Vertigo\" De Meyst reveals the whole truth fifteen minutes before the end and the final scenes are absolutely mind-boggling,mixing fine lines (as Wens ,pursued by the criminal,tries to climb ,Dolo screams:\"there\u0027s nothing up there but the sky\" ),humor,and folie à deux (Déa seeing the black sheep of the family turning into her husband).\n\nNow let\u0027s wait for reissues of Steeman-inspired movies:\"le furet\" and \"le mannequin assassiné\" both released in the late fifties.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
