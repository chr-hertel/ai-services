I knew Stacey Peralta (not a Mexican) was a good skater, but not this good!! Rebecca De Mornay was the mother of the vato skater named Jay. I always thought Rebecca De Mornay\u0027s son was going to stick to skating but he didn\u0027t. He got involved in gangs for some silly reason. Rebecca De Mornay was sure swanky looking in this movie as the Crystal meth addicted mother of Jay. However, Rebecca De Mornay did deliver the goods.\n\nThe best scene was whew Tony hit that one guy in the face. Rebecca De Mornay was not in that scene.\n\nI just hope that nobody decides to try and skate too much these days because it\u0027s just so dangerous when you try to do too many tricks.\n\nLook out for cameos by Tony Falcon and Eddie Van Halan.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
