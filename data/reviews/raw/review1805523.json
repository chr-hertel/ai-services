Imagine the most annoying voice you can and then square that and that is the narrator. The narrator alone completely destroys any entertainment value to be had at films of cute baby animals.\n\nThe baby animals have an unbelievable adventure involving animals that I don\u0027t believe are even all native to the land. But that small continuity error aside, even if there were that many diverse species all living so close to one another it\u0027s impossible to believe that these animals would run into so many in just one day.\n\nIn addition, there are scenes that may not be suitable for children that show cruelty to animals. While this isn\u0027t the main reason I don\u0027t like the movie, it adds to the whole effect.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
