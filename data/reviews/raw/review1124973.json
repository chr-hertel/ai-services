Matt Letscher stars as Guy Stone, a matinée idol along the lines of Rock Hudson, who leads a tricky double life. To the public at large he\u0027s a macho superstar heartthrob, the fantasy love object of women the world over, all of whom dream of being the one to finally strip him of his status as filmdom\u0027s \"most eligible young bachelor.\" In his private life, he spends most of his time prowling the bar scene for the next available hunk. In fact, Guy is so shallow that he doesn\u0027t even bother to learn the names of the star-struck men he sleeps with. Desperate to get the lead role in the upcoming epic \"Ben-Hur,\" Guy agrees to enter into a sham marriage with a naïve young secretary working at the studio (she is unaware of Guy\u0027s sexuality and believes he actually loves her). Soon we\u0027re deep into a laugh-filled version of \"Far From Heaven,\" with Guy struggling to maintain interest in his new heterosexual lifestyle, a charade that becomes even more difficult after he meets the man of his dreams, an idealistic young writer named Rick Foster, who makes Guy think twice about the life of deceit he\u0027s leading.\n\nDirector Richard Day has written a script (based on his own stage play) filled with lacerating wit, hilarious puns (starting with the title of the movie and the name of the main character) and absurdist situations. He casts a scathing eye not only on anti-gay prejudice but on Tinsel Town phoniness, Red-baiting and superficial relationships as well. The movie shimmers with the bright, shiny look of \u002750\u0027s films, while the sets and costumes capture the period with rib-tickling fidelity (Guy\u0027s peeling himself off a plastic, slip-covered sofa is priceless). The actors are all wonderful in their roles, particularly Letscher as Guy, Carrie Preston as his perfect little wife, Victor Raider-Wexler as the studio head and, above all, Veronica Cartwright (the young girl in \"The Birds\"), absolutely hilarious as Guy\u0027s understanding but pragmatic agent whose job it is to make sure Guy\u0027s career and hers don\u0027t suddenly come crashing down in flames around them.\n\n\"Straight-Jacket\" is really a story about a man\u0027s coming to terms with reality, accepting himself for who he is, and changing society a little bit for the better in the process - with the Red Scare references serving mainly as allegorical allusions to the homophobia of today. This thematic layering is what makes \"Straight-Jacket\" one of the sharpest and most thoughtful movie comedies in a long time.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
