Lily Chung (who was Ming-Ming in the far superior RED TO KILL) plays another tortured soul (the type of role she seems to do so well...) who is the \"black sheep\" of her family. There doesn\u0027t appear to be any real rhyme or reason, but her mother, father, sister, and brother all hate her and treat her like complete garbage. Eventually she gets tired of the constant abuse (and the abuse takes many disturbing shapes) and flips the f\u0027ck out. The rest is pretty typical Cat III history.\n\nDAUGHTER OF DARKNESS isn\u0027t bad, but it isn\u0027t nearly as much of a stand-out HK \"shocker\" as THE UNTOLD STORY, RED TO KILL, or THE EBOLA SYNDROME, for example. Anthony Wong has another great performance - and even though he is a cop in this one, he is still a twisted, perverse, filthy f!cking scum-bag (and that\u0027s why we love ya Tony!!!). One of the big problems is that DAUGHTER OF DARKNESS starts as almost a straight-up comedy, then switches mid-film into a typical Cat III sleaze-fest when Chung begins to tell her story of abuse to the cops. I don\u0027t much mind the comedic aspects that tend to go along with even the most shocking of these types of films, but DAUGHTER OF DARKNESS switched from comedy to serious drama in a blink, and made for a disjointed feel. Regardless, still a decent entry and worth a look for all you pervert douche-bags out there (like me...) ; ) 7/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
