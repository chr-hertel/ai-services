No matter what stereotype of people they were showing(Mexican, southern, gay, etc) it was always in a positive light.\n\nI couldn\u0027t take my eyes off the screen and found myself very engaged with each character. Well written, and very well told story.\n\nI hope to see it in theaters soon nationally and I want to know when the Jesus the Driver video game comes out too.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
