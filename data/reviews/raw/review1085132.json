Anakin\u0027s decent into the darkside is both emotional and exciting. Although the Chemistry between Padme and Anakin is still a little fishy, its the Anakin/Obi wan dynamic that is truly inspirational. Emporer Palpatine steals every scene that he\u0027s in and Mace Windu gets the ending that Sam Jackson always wanted, not to go out like some punk. Its great to see the star wars saga go out with a bang.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
