The story line jumps all over the place, except during the many times when stock footage is shown to make the movie longer - way too much longer. \n\nThe \"City of the Dead\" is so obviously Asian (perhaps Anwat) that I was surprised they had the gall to show it in this \"African jungle\" movie. That was also stock footage as the actors and the \"City\" are never seen together. The budget for this movie was probably a couple of hundred dollars. \n\nI like Buster Crabbe, but I was hoping the sharks would kill him in this movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
