At first I was convinced that this was just one of those cheap German movies that come out.Oh boy was I wrong.\n\nDead wrong.\n\nI COULD NOT STOP LAUGHING AT THE GORE!!!! This film makes Hostel look like \"Sesame Street\". Not even Ichi the killer came this close!!!! Mutilations,beheadings,evisceratons,and rape this movie offers in spades!! Not even the women and children are safe as they get their heads crushed and are raped! This is over-the-top sleazy fun that would even make Tarantino vomit his guts out!!! People who criticize this should know: their movies doesn\u0027t even come close to the high I experienced when I watched this movie.\n\nOlaf Ittenbach,you deserve a standing ovation.\n\nBloody well done.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
