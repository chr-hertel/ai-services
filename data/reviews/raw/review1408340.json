On one hand, the movie is good, the play of Linda and Perepeczko is excellent, and the power of their persuasion is great. On the other hand, the film has many weak sides - first of all, too much unnecessary teen nudity on the side of d√©butante Agnieszka Wlodarczyk. No, she is a very beautiful lady, but was that really necessary to show her naked so often? Then, the second part of the film where there is so much blood and so many dead bodies. Really too too too much of it all. Violence here is merely for violence\u0027s sake, and this is a big minus. The performance of Cesare Pazura is rather vapid and secondary, in fact, there are only Boguslaw Linda and Marek Perepeczko who save this work. I really was perplexed when saw the film for the first time here in Russia, then in POland I saw the full version and got the point - the local Russian TV authorities cut all erotic scenes and some dialogs as well and thus broke the continuity. But then, even with all the erotic scenes back on board, the film didn\u0027t work out well. Half-baked job.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
