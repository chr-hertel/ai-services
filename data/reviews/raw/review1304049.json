From their first raw encounter of physical intimacy, to the warmth and compassion that follows, we are taken on a journey of love and despair as these 2 men endeavour to keep alive an impossible relationship in the most difficult and unforgiving of times.\n\nFull of passion, daring, hope and despair, Heath \u0026 Jake give extremely brave and heartfelt performances in roles that not only would be a formidable challenge for any straight actor, but that will also shake and perhaps change forever the traditional stereo-type of the American cowboy. The courage required to bring this \u0027forbidden\u0027 love story to life on the screen is almost breathtaking, and is fully deserving of any awards that come its\u0027 way", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
