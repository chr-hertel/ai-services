Having been a single mother, I love how unpredictable each episode is. Just like real life, not every situation turns out good. I like how the show deals with this and it keeps it interesting.. I could not stop watching the first season on DVD....\n\nPlease continue the show. The development of the characters is so open for possibilities that the show could easily continue for several seasons without losing it\u0027s appeal. All three actresses are excellent and so believable in their parts.. Kudos to them and the writer\u0027s. The director did an excellent job on how you are pulled into the scene with the actors...anyone who watches this won\u0027t want it to end.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
