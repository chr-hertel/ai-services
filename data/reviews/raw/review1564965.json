But whereas those movies were exciting and inventive, \"Thre3e\" is neither. \n\nBased on the popular book by Ted Dekker, \"Thre3e\" is being marketed as a Christian movie  taking great lengths to avoid gore and graphic language  but outside of a few cursory religious references and a weightless proclamation to \"trust God\" by a priest character at the end, you would have no idea of its intentions. The only attempted message or theme is knowing the difference between good and evil, which you can find in many other (and better) non-Christian movies. \n\n\"Thre3e\" uses every suspense/mystery cliché in the book (dark tones, haggard cops, quick shots of the villain) and some stylistic devices are lifted completely from other movies (\"Final Destination\" fans will recognize at least one), but it still fails to come off as anything but a low budget production. Even though bomb-laced traps are a heavy part of the story, there is never any real danger felt by the viewer because when the bombs explode, nothing is destroyed (example: characters run from a refrigerator before it explodes, but upon later inspection the appliance is almost wholly intact).\n\nThe only thing \"Thre3e\" has going for it is an M. Night Shyamalan-style \"twist\" ending, which ends up being completely unsatisfying and nearly unbelievable. Those wishing to see this because it\u0027s a rare Christian thriller will be disappointed for many reasons: it\u0027s hinted that one character suffers from stigmata but it\u0027s never explored or explained; the main character is in seminary, yet there is no reason to believe he would want to become a priest or even what his religious feelings are, if any.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
