I was COMpletely stunned when my extras role in the film (shot over 12 months ago at Kurnell near Sydney - the interior hospital shoots) became a 5+ second on-screen feature! I am the skinny white guy who looks quite surprised at the end of Superman Returns after he is wheeled into hospital from throwing the island of New Krypton into Space. I don\u0027t want to blow my own horn here, but... well OK i do! Its probably the ONLY time i\u0027ll get a shot on the silver screen - \u0026 I am very pleased! :) CHEERS FOLKS!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
