I thought the dialogue a bit silly in places and the plot was hard work but this film looked amazing. I understand its all been shot in HD which to begin with has a unattractive feel to it. However, as the film progressed I really got into the feel. Great sound track until a very silly cover of In The Air Tonight (which as with all of Phil Collins work is tosh). I think it would be interesting to see if there will be a second film. Not sure what you could do with it. What would be wonderful would be a new TV series with Colin Farel and Jamie Foxx sticking with it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
