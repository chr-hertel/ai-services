This is always an handy and safe approach when you work with an actor that is not really an actor in the first place. As a matter of fact, Cash spends halve of the time singing in this movie.\n\nBesides Johnny Cash and Peter Falk the movie, among others, also features Ida Lupino. Columbo movies often featured movie stars from the \u0027old days\u0027. Ida Lupino actually also starred before in the other previous Columbo movie \"Columbo: Short Fuse\". Lupino is best known for the work she did in the 40\u0027s, with movies such as \"High Sierra\", \"The Sea Wolf\" and \"They Drive by Night\" on her resume.\n\nThe movie is directed by Nicholas Colasanto, who also directed the most excellent Columbo movie \"Columbo: Étude in Black\". That movie was mostly great since he left the two main leading men, Peter Falk and John Cassavetes, lots of room to improvise and do things their own way, rather than being hold down by a script or directed. But of course with a movie that stars non-professional actor Johnny Cash you can\u0027t really afford to choose this approach, even though he obviously still gave some of the other actors some room. The directing for this movie also most certainly is not bad, it\u0027s actually quite great but it can\u0027t really touch \"Columbo: Étude in Black\". Nicholas Colasanto himself by the way still better known to the world as an actor, who portrayed the character Coach in the hit-series \"Cheers\", right till his death in 1985.\n\nNicholas Colasanto\u0027s directing style on the other hand has as a consequence that the movie is slow moving in parts and you have the feeling at times that Colasanto\u0027s overdid it perhaps at times with his directing approach.\n\nAn all in all good Columbo movie, that is obviously especially worth watching for the fans of Johnny Cash.\n\n7/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
