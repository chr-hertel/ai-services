Movie did not explain characters\u0027 reactions or decisions very well, hence not answering the question \u0027why?\u0027. It is a huge mistake especially in this case, when there really are the right answers: in the book. Of course it is good to give the viewer a chance to think by him/herself, but when this is done and characters for first time act unrealistically or dramatically other way than the viewer thought they would do, movie becomes something that viewer considers... stupid.\n\nAs a whole, it was not a bad movie. It only was too quick one. Main actors performed well.\n\nAnimation was nice, though Aslan sometimes looked more like a cat from Pixar movie, rather than being a photo-realistic lion.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
