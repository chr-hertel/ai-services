Heath Ledger didn\u0027t completely fail at portraying The Joker, but to compare him with Nicholson and favor him is insulting to both their careers. He\u0027s essentially just playing a rather generic psychotic role in the mantle of the joker and can\u0027t really dazzle anymore after a scene or four. Christian Bale is like a fossilized chunk of wood in his role as Bruce Wayne and as (the) Batman just seemed to be in the wrong movie and desperately in need of some antibiotics.\n\nMichael Caine and Morgan Freeman were fortunately able to add credibility to it all and when they appeared on screen, the movie was actually pretty great. Pity though that they only got about 1 % of the movie\u0027s screen time. Aaron Eckhardt was given nada to work with and was equally wasted. But who can really be surprised watching a movie like this. Just too many inane plot turns which just pulls you further and further away from wanting to find out where it all was heading. I Walked out after the 100 minute mark to get a smoke and just couldn\u0027t bother to walk back into the theater.\n\nThe evening was saved approaching a charming girl at the cinema bar serving ridiculously overpriced, yet abhorrently tasting cocktails. We ended up at her place and we danced to K\u0026D until the first rays of morning sunlight found their way through the ragged drapes covering a cracked windowpane. As she peeled of my clothes as if I was an overripe tangerine, she whispered softly in my ear a mantra of passion.\n\nFilm: 1/**** Night: 4/****", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
