First off, it\u0027s in color (if pretty ugly color). Second, its incredibly beautiful Swedish star Marie Lilljehdahl is actually \"barely legal\" here whereas in the first one, made a few years earlier, she could better be described as \"hardly legal\". Perhaps most importantly though , this is more cosmopolitan, \"Swinging\"-Europe era movie rather than a provincial domestic drama like its predecessor.\n\nAs the story begins Inga has just broken-up with her long-time boyfriend, Sven. She takes a job as a secretary for an older writer (wearing the shortest miniskirt ever seen on any secretary anywhere) and, not too surprisingly, she falls into an affair with him. She also becomes involved with a bad Swedish rock star, which raises the ire of another of the rock star\u0027s girlfriends, an icy but sexy blonde minx name Greta (an alternate title for this movie was \"Inga and Greta\"). So will Greta take revenge? Maybe. Will her revenge involve lots of nudity and some lesbian/bi-sexual escapades by both Swedish lasses? I\u0027m not saying. This movie IS kind of depressing as other reviewers have said, but then sex itself is often kind of depressing, so you perhaps shouldn\u0027t expect movies about it to always be light-hearted and fun.\n\nStrangely, this pretty obscure movie recently got a star DVD release including interviews with Lillejedahl and with Joe Sarno and his wife Peggy. Joe Sarno has got to be the nicest man in porn, but he says some really strange things here like claiming that \"other directors\" (perhaps a reference to Jess Franco) really \"exploited\" Lillejedahl. That may very well be true, but coming from the guy that cast her in the original \"Inga\" when she was all of about sixteen. . .ummm. Not Sarno or Llijedahl\u0027s best movie certainly, but worth watching if you like 60\u0027s and 70\u0027s Swedish erotica." }
