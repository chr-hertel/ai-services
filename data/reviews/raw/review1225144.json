Joaquin had a tougher role but he came through beautifully in expressing the angst and struggle in JC\u0027s life.\n\nThe actors did a very credible job singing and the drama around their relationship was interesting and poignant.\n\nJC was a brilliant songwriter and singer who took some wrong paths on his road to fame and somehow lived to tell about it. The glimpses of his past give us an indication of where his dark side came from and yet he never gives up.\n\nI really enjoyed this movie and I think you will too!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
