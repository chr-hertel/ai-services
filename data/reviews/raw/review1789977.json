Kill! Kill! and Vixen is also the film that put the great director on the map. As anyone who knows Meyer\u0027s movies will probably already know, Vixen stars a buxom lady in the lead role and puts most of its focus on sex. Unlike Meyer\u0027s later work, however, Vixen actually seems to want to make some sort of political point; which while absurd and completely redundant, gives the film an extra layer. The plot is simple, as is often the case with Meyer\u0027s movies, and focuses on a young woman in British Canada named Vixen. As her name suggests, Vixen enjoys seducing people; both men and woman, with no prejudice...except for the fact that she\u0027s openly racist, which causes arguments with her brother\u0027s black friend...\n\nIt\u0027s the buxom females that make Russ Meyer\u0027s films what they are, and this one is no exception. Erica Gavin takes the lead role and fits it like a glove. It\u0027s true that her ample chest does her a few favours, but she\u0027s also a decent actress and always entirely believable in her role. Russ Meyer\u0027s later films feature plenty of full frontal nudity and can be considered \u0027hardcore\u0027 - but that isn\u0027t the case here. The film is only soft - the sex scenes aren\u0027t explicit and while the women are happy to take their tops off, nothing else is shown. This may be a disappointment to anyone going into this film and expecting something more like Meyer\u0027s later stuff, but it didn\u0027t bother me much as the film has more than enough else about it to ensure that it\u0027s entertaining. The one lesbian scene is excellently done and erotic in spite of the fact that it\u0027s not explicit; while a strange sequence involving fish and the incest scene between Vixen and her brother is sure to shock some viewers even now, so I\u0027m sure that was the case in the sixties too. Meyer also sees fit to include political themes and racial issues in the film, which make it all the more bizarre considering how out of place it feels! Vixen is a highly enjoyable piece of film-making and I\u0027m confident that it will hit all the right notes for my fellow Meyer fans!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
