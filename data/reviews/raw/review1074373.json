What good could come of it. We have an urban legend and childhood fantasies, but the story evolves and gets really exciting...\n\nI was constantly moving in my chair trying to avoid looking at the screen and listening to the sound, it was a perfect chiller. I had chills running down my spine all the way through the movie... (If I had a pillow to hid behind I would have used it)\n\nI think the Director have done an excellent job here, the setup was really great. It made me feel really scared, the sound, the picture and the acting all rolled into one, it was just great. A lot of other Hollywood movie just don\u0027t cut it. This movie doesn\u0027t use a load of special effects to buff up, it just makes it all happen with good angles, darkness and formidable music...\n\nThe only other movie that came close to this was \"The Others\"...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
