I mean the Bible, Jesus,Mary Magdeline, the Pope, just to name a few, the Knights Templar, The Crusades. It\u0027s a lot to take in but let\u0027s try, I can buy the fact that their could be a conspiracy i mean just look at the Catholic Church, now i was raised protestant, and haven\u0027t been to church in many years, after being made to go as a kid, but the point is, the corruption in the church, Jesus was 33 when he died, you mean to tell me he never had sex,, course he did, he was mortal i believe, him having a kid, i\u0027ll buy that much. I liked the first 1:45 of the movie, then well it seemed to me that too much was revealed at the wrong time, making it less than suspenseful after that. I loved the character of Silas, played by Paul Bettany, Tom Hanks character i liked very much. seeking the truth, very studious, always thinking, i respect that. I absolutely think Jean Reno shined in this movie, he is one of the best French actors today. I think that this movie came too quickly after the book, I haven\u0027t read the book, but i will someday. The movie took us to magical places. Westminster Abby, the Louvre, just to name 2 . All in all like i said a great thriller, mystery. lots of intrigue, for the first hour and forty five mins.. after that well, it just didn\u0027t work for me. but that\u0027s me.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
