I haven\u0027t seen \"Nine Queens\" so I can\u0027t say how faithful or not this film is to the original.\n\nThe story, set in Los Angeles, concerns con-man Richard Gaddis (John C Reilly) who spends the day teaching his young protégé Rodrigo (Diego Luna) the rules of his trade, until they both get caught up in a forgery scam.\n\n\"Criminal\" adds nothing new to the usual formula of con-artist thrillers and does rely a little too heavily on coincidence in the plot. However it is also very entertaining, very fast and very well-played by a great cast. It is a great fun film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
