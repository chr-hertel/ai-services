Taylor Hackford takes us through Ray Charles life from his early childhood days before he lost his site and periods of his life in the 50\u0027s and 60\u0027s at the height of his stardom.\n\nRay\u0027s life was all over the map. He suffered all his life from witnessing the death of his brother, he had an ongoing drug habit that almost wrecked his life, and he had numerous infidelities. He had two main constants going for him. His wife Bea and his music. The movie takes us through all those times and sometimes to a fault as it moves a little too slowly at times.\n\nThe movie works on two levels. The amazing performance of Jamie Foxx, who put his heart and soul into this role and the music which accompanies the film. For fans of Ray Charles, you have yourself a wonderful soundtrack.\n\nI don\u0027t think this movie necessarily deserved an Oscar nomination for best picture but it is very entertaining and you\u0027ll certainly enjoy it.
