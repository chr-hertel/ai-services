There were films that were made to be just fun b-movies and they served that purpose well but there were also films that were made with serious intentions... And that made them even more ridiculous :D It was the decay of the once very good Greek cinema and we enjoy those works even today! \"Ta Katharmata\" (or \"The Bastards\" in English) were an example of the second category. It was hilarious!!! And now, 20 years later, we have the sequel which is probably one of the most cult b-movies ever shot! Not only in Greece, perhaps in the whole universe! Yes ladies and gentlemen, it\u0027s that bad!! I mean, seeing Apostolos Sougklakos in sex scenes that last 10 minutes is one thing. But the whole thing is so messed up!! Ah, the lines they deliver... The actors... I doubt Tsachiridis and Pitsilos had played in anything for about a decade but now we see them both again in their full b-movie glory!!! When I saw this movie with my friends we just couldn\u0027t stop laughing!! My heart ached afterwards from all that laughter. Yeah, the 80\u0027s are back and this is the greatest proof of all!!! Fellow b-movie fans worldwide: take my advice and search for this movie. Surely it must be somewhere on the internet, what the hell. You won\u0027t regret it. In fact you will keep this DVD like a jewel. And don\u0027t forget to check out the 11-minute commentary of Pitsilos on the classic Greek cult films of the 80\u0027s. I just wish he had included a few more! I would just like to end this review by saying that I have had the honour to meet Apostolos Sougklakos in person. My father used to be a wrestler too and they are friends. But although I had already seen plenty of his films when I met him, I hadn\u0027t seen this one yet. I just hope I will meet him again soon! Man, this movie is a monument", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
