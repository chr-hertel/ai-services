The truth: there is no solution. Taken verbatim, the plot / story / dialogue is non-sensical. I saw someone compare this to Momento. Momento (and for that matter 21 grams) has a logical solution; Primer does not.\n\nI challenge you to provide a coherent explanation for all elements of the story. It is not possible, unless you reject some of the dialogue as mistaken, intentional or otherwise.\n\nI\u0027m only curious if the writer intended this film to be that way (in an Andy Kaufman kind of way--make the viewer part of the joke), or just got confused by his own convolution. I can just see the writer laughing at IMDb posts where some pseudo-intellectuals are deprecating others for not \"getting it.\" It is amazing that \"you\u0027re an idiot\" posts seem to outnumber other posts 20:1.\n\nThis movie is the cinematic equivalent of the old joke(s): What\u0027s the difference between a duck? Where does the white go when the snow melts? Is the moon to the right, or to the left, of the sun?" }
