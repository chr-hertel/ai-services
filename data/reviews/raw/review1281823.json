Here we have the enterprises of Gwizdo e Lian-Chu, two dragon hunters who lives in a fantastic world of floating island. The first is a cowardly but speedy-talked young man whose passion is to have a contract signed for his job of everyday: the dragon hunting. But it\u0027s his big comrade Lian-Chu (as big as he\u0027s good)to fight against their amazing enemies. That\u0027s it, the dragons are almost always defeated, but hardly our heroes manage to be paid for this. Every episode told a story, not only the chase (that is actually left on the background), and each of these is an amusing adventure all to be enjoyed. I repeat: this series can be not a masterpiece, but it\u0027s a little jewel, very original especially for an European production (of animation, for in the French comics we can see more better things of this kind). Last thing: pay attention to the catchy opening theme, \"The dragon hunters song\" by the Cure!" }
