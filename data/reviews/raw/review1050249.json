When I finally got the chance, it wasn\u0027t what I expected - it was different, and perhaps, better than my interpretation.\n\nI think it was really the fact that there was dialogue than I\u0027d have imagined and that it was restrained and passionate in equal amounts. Getting criticism out of the way first, I really hoped there\u0027d be more focus on the sisters separately and less than on the boys, but perhaps that\u0027s what made it so special and poignant.\n\nIt\u0027s an odd and difficult for some, story to swallow, but it\u0027s captured by Coppola\u0027s unique, eclectic style of script and direction and transformed into an absolutely beautiful, mesmerizing piece, camera-work reminiscent to that used in \"Heavenly Creatures\" and the teenage boys\u0027 points of view similar to \"Stand By Me.\" While the narration and views on the captivating Lisbon sisters is thoughtful and sensitive, what really makes the film arresting and irresistible is Coppola\u0027s vivid imagery: Hartnett and Dunst entwined on the crisp playing field, the youngest daughter floating in the bath...these are images you don\u0027t forget in a hurry.\n\nIf there were more focus, perhaps, on the Lisbon family, then more could\u0027ve been done with it, but the actors make the most of what they have: Woods is typically brilliant as the father, Turner heartbreakingly reserved as the mother, Hartnett cocky and charming and you can tell Coppola thinks Dunst\u0027s face is something special - it floats over every other shot like a beautiful angel, contrasted with her bad-girl Lux.\n\nThe film may come as a surprise, but you won\u0027t want to switch it off: from the opening scene to the end, it\u0027ll stay with you - and you\u0027ll want it to.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
