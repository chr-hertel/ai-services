And it makes sense and it\u0027s not so coincidental they\u0027ve collided with one another .... and how refreshing when loyalty and unconditional love burst up through the thick crust of life --- and the mirror does reflect light.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
