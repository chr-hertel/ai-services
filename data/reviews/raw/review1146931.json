I agree with this sentiment. What makes it ironic is that Hideo Nakata, the esteemed director of Ringu, was brought in to direct this mess. The presence of one name in the credits, however, brings me to believe that the overall mess has to do with the screenplay. You guessed it, Ehren Kruger, the man who first came into prominence with Scream 3, wrote The Ring Two. Granted, he also wrote the first American adaptation of the Japanese Ringu films, but director Gore Verbinski was able to wrestle a decent final product out of his raw material. It appears that Hideo Nakata thought he was up to the task of wrestling a decent end product out of Ehren Kruger\u0027s writing. He proved himself quite wrong. The actors do the best they can, and David Dorfman does a lot less sleepwalking in this episode, but I believe this film can be credited with killing off any chance of further Ringu adaptations.\n\nOf course, the acting is good enough to pass muster, as was the case in the previous Ring. Naomi Watts is a surprisingly competent actor, given that her credits include a stint on the Australian soapie I like to call Please Go Away. Once again, she goes through the standard motions expected of a Scream Queen with championship pride. All the clichés are present and accounted for, but she shrugs them off like she is right at home in her environment. Then again, when one has worked for David Lynch, I suppose even creepy scenes such as the emergences of Samara from the TV set seem routine. However, when you get right down to it, Watts is the only real star in the film. Much was made of Sissy Spacek\u0027s role in the film, but it has turned out to be one of the most overstated walk-ons in the history of the genre. It was not until I viewed the IMDb credits for the film that I was even aware of her appearance in the film. David Dorfman, as previously intimated, has been given less of a zombie-like appearance in this film, but in so doing, his character also becomes a lot less interesting.\n\nThe visual effects of the previous Ring were mainly limited to one instance of a girl crawling out of the television set, combined with some practical effects or trick editing. In this sequel, there are endless shots of water flowing in unnatural directions, people being sucked in and out of televisions, or people polymorphing. The plot feels like a blur, and I was only able to catch fragments relating to some lost relative of Samara\u0027s or how she is able to torment the family in spite of all the conditions being met in the first film for her to leave them be. In short, I was given little reason to care about the machinations that the central characters go through this time. Without a decent character to hang our cares upon, the film\u0027s sense of horror or terror literally falls apart. It does not help that we have no idea what the framework of rules regarding what Samara can or cannot do is meant to be.\n\nAs I said, a previous commentator has stated that The Ring Two lacks everything that made The Ring good. Suspense? It is on the cutting room floor. Terror? The framework for it was never there to begin with. Horror? It appears the director would not know it if they were formally introduced. New lead Simon Baker tries his best, but Martin Henderson, his equivalent in the first American film, was able to make us care about his character. Partly because the screenplay seemed to be coherent, but also because he is able to act the part without resorting to cliché. Simon Baker is swimming uphill against a director who does not seem to care about building a structured plot, and a screenplay that has him speaking so unnaturally it is a wonder he did not cough up a boot during his scenes with David Dorfman. No matter how I try, I cannot think up a simple cause and effect pattern to the events in the film. It is literally a collage of scenes that are meant to be horrifying, but have no framework on which to hang.\n\nIt is for this reason that I am giving The Ring Two a two out of ten. It is bad. Not bad enough to be good, but not good enough to be entertaining, either. It literally winds up in no man\u0027s land. See it if you can get it for free, but if there is something better on, such as a collection of You Can\u0027t Do That On Television repeats, watch that instead.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
