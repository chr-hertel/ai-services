I wanted to see if they had stuck to the book at all and i think they have done very well with keeping to the book. I\u0027ve now starting reading it from the beginning and I\u0027m entranced by the book as well. i would insist people see this film, and it doesn\u0027t matter if you don\u0027t like films like this, just give it a chance because it truly is a beautiful and well directed film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
