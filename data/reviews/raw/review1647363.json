In fact, it\u0027s best just to sit back, relax and enjoy the disastrous spectacle on display.\n\nSo for fellow trash fans, what do you get for your moneys worth here? Well, First and foremost Reb Brown! And yes, he gets to perform some of his trademark screaming to!!! (although sadly not as much as in the classic Strike Commando) Our Reb is joined for the ride by none other than John Phillip Law who is clearly having a whale of a time with his material and proceeds to ham it up hilariously with his constant maniacal laughter and over acting.\n\nAlso of intrinsic mention is the much talked about stolen  erm, I mean \u0027borrowed\u0027 footage from Battlestar Gallactica(!!!),a number of daft chases involving what look like slightly modified mobility cars (and which move at about the same velocity!), some really weird scenes of dancing mystics (note: sexy women!) which make for very little sense whatsoever(!!!), a hola-hoop disco scene(!!!!!!!!!!!!!), some pretty risible special effects throughout and of course bad acting aplenty from the rest of the bemused cast.\n\nWell, what more could you ask for in a film?!\n\nIn fact, why are you still reading this review?!  Go out and grab yourself a copy of this flick right now..", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
