As it turns out that genre is probably only referring to the first 5 or so minutes of the movie. The rest of the runtime is just a concert registration, which was a shame for me. I\u0027m not a fan of Neil Young or his music, i just watched the movie to watch a legend talk, the same way i watched Walk The Line to broaden my horizon, even though I\u0027m no fan of Johnny Cash.\n\nThe concert is well played and well recorded, but if you\u0027re not into Neil Young it\u0027s not very entertaining. There is hardly any show element, it only proves that he can play live just as well as in a studio.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
