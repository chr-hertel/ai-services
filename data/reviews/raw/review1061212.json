You are a terrible James Bond. I know that you are all suave and handsome for the ladies, but every since you took on the role of 007, the franchise has been slowly going down the Lou. You need proof? I\u0027ve got proof. They are Goldeneye, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World is not Enough and Die Another Day. The latter film being the ultimate rock bottom. This film is complete junk. I would be here all day telling every single detail that made this film bad, so I\u0027ll just hit the biggies. The CGI is, of course, the worst thing I\u0027ve seen in a movie since Spiderman 2. Of subject real quick...Hey Hollywood, they\u0027re called stunt men. We used to have them. What happened? Anyway, back to Bond. The editing was atrocious and the directing was a farce. Halle Berry was very good at playing her poorly written, under developed character. Props to her. I know that Bond girls are nothing more than eye candy, but DAD takes this to the extremes. Denise Richards had a better character in The World is Not Enough, and she can\u0027t even act. As bad as Brosnan is as 007, he couldn\u0027t seem too overthrow Roger Moore. He still hasn\u0027t, but if he sticks around much longer, he will. Roger Moore will never shake down movies like The Man with the Golden Gun, Moonraker, or A View to a Kill. These will always be terrible. But Brosnan is getting closer and closer to this level of terrible with each new Bond movie he\u0027s in. In the end, this movie had two good parts. The Aston-Martin Vanquish (when it was visible), and Halle Berry dripping wet and walking out of the ocean (should\u0027ve killed her character right then and saved her the embarrassment). Get on Pierce Brosnan. Surely there\u0027s a suave and sophisticated British man to take your place. Heck, I\u0027ll settle for a Scot. After all, Sean Connery is Scottish. 3/10...and that\u0027s only for ditching the BMW and bringing back the Aston-Martin.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
