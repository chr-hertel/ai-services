But this one is even better. Going to different places around the world to meet the thinkers and discuss there ideas is a great way of filling the film with visual content. It is always curious to see how all these different people live.\n\nBut for all the science conveyed in the film, in the end the fundamental question still remains, which may be more philosophical than scientific: What actually is time? My own simplistic theory is that Time Is; As in the notion of the verb \"to be\". It cannot be separated from anything and it is everything at the same time.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
