I kept watching because the photography for that era was crystal-clear, and the editing consistent in its continuity, more so than many movies of that era, and even some made years later.\n\nAnd the amazing thing about the acting was, it was so masterfully real-to-life, but without being plain or uninteresting. It was raw, real, and believable. This went on mostly in scenes between Myra and Roy, (Mae Clarke and Douglas Montgomery). Even very long dialogues just rolled on so naturally, you felt like you were in the scene with them. The conflict between characters also develops well.\n\nRoy\u0027s mother, Mary Cronin Wetherby (Enid Bennett), was absolutely charming in her manner, reflections, and uplifting advice to - and acceptance of - Myra.\n\nThe 1941 version was an overall better film, in terms of pacing and cinematography; and since the emphasis was not on sleeze, but charming and budding love. Still, this original (1931) version is a masterpiece of photography and acting for its time. And catch Bette Davis in her 3rd film role, as Roy\u0027s sister... utterly charming! \n\nExcept for the sudden, unexpected, schlocky instantaneous ending, it is an amazing film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
