Getting \"G\" rated movies that are not cartoons is very rare. It is nice to know there are still people that can create this type of movie. This movie is excellent and I can gladly recommend it to all my friends. You see, you don\u0027t have to be a Christian in order to like these types of movies. Thanks very much. I am looking for more, please keep them coming. In the pass I have only been able to get them from Family Feature Films. On some occasions I could get them from Hallmark but they don\u0027t seem to come out often enough for me. Skeet Ulrich is a new actor for me and he and Keri did an excellent job getting the point across. It was nice to know there were young ladies that listen to their parents.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
