Although a nostalgic trip back in time, this version will always stand the test of time. The black and white monochrome gives a timeless quality which sometimes colour cannot.\n\nThe day to day detail of Robinson Crusoe\u0027s mind-numbing existence and how he is able to overcome the many obstacles taken for granted is brilliantly worked. By inter-cutting flashbacks until the time when his life on the island begins to take shape, momentum is never lost.\n\nThe haunting musical score adds an integral dimension to the overall fascination of the series.\n\nThe French production team and main actor Robert Hoffman deserve much praise for the achievement created here. Not only a cult classic, this TV series, like the book, is now one all of its own.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
