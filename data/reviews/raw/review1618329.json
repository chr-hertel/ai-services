The storyline is not linear \u0026 is a bit deceptive. On the surface it appears to be a rather simple movie/cartoon about druggies \u0026 their life. \n\nI\u0027ve seen this movie 3 times now and I find new details which become more apparent \u0026 obvious with each viewing. It\u0027s kinda like glossing over something the first time \u0026 then \"REALLY\" seeing what\u0027s happening upon further inspection almost like in (dare I say it), Fight Club.\n\nThis is my favorite Phillip K. Dick (Blade Runner, Minority Report, Total Recall, Paycheck) movie adaptation \u0026 I think that Richard Linklater made a great decision in rotoscoping the film. Some people have complained about it and either don\u0027t like it or feel that it\u0027s senseless to make the film seem like a cartoon. I did\u0027nt have a problem with it, though the scramble suits are quite interesting. I thought that it added to the nuance of almost feeling like YOU the viewer are taking substance D along with the characters. Initially I rated this movie 8 out of 10 but I love it more \u0026 more with each viewing. It has high replay value (imo) and It\u0027s definitely one of my top 10 favorites ...subliminally \u003d)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
