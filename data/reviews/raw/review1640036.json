Beatty, a sometimes underrated and effective actor, is utterly at a loss trying to carry this charmless and senseless film. Penn and Beatty learned a few things here, but in Bonnie and Clyde they were applying them to the service of a story.\n\nFilm fans may want to seek out \"Mickey One\" for it\u0027s general weirdness, but don\u0027t expect to like it much. Just because the basic idea is vague, doesn\u0027t mean every scene has to meander. Any episode of \"The Prisoner\" did the Kafka thing, but with humor and cleverness to keep your interest in the ideas. \n\nSome interesting location work in a very different looking Chicago that might be interest to locals, too bad you have to watch the movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
