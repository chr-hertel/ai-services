It is the disgraceful bottoming out of two great franchises, and I spent $4.99 on pay-per-view to see it. Go ahead, laugh, I deserve it.\n\nThere is nothing more to say about this horrible movie, but IMDb won\u0027t let me enter my review until I\u0027ve used up ten lines, so here goes: Don\u0027t see this movie, don\u0027t rent it, and for heaven\u0027s sake don\u0027t see any movie ever made or that ever will be made by the schmendricks who are responsible for it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
