I was pretty excited to hear about another horror movie that was made independently then went straight to DVD. I was hoping it would be like Evil Dead, but it was more serious (and less loud). It was kind of slow moving here \u0026 there, but the storyline was very cool and there were some really surprisingly good actors that I had never heard of before. I heard that someone in the cast or crew died! Does anyone know if that\u0027s true? One last question, because I watched the part over \u0026 over trying to figure it out: That demon who jumps at the camera in the bathroom or whatever scared the crap out of me! But I have to ask- is it a guy or a girl?! It ~sounds~ like a girl crying, but it\u0027s so hard to tell these days with make up and all. Utterly CREEPY! Could you just imagine walking into use the bathroom \u0026 having THAT jump out at you? LOL, it would be a mess! I\u0027m just curious, if anybody knows? Definitely worth a look!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
