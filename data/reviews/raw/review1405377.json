I did not like generally like the ending but I have seen this movie many times now and love it.Its mainly about a girl who it stuck with her sisters boyfriend while on their way to move in with her sister. Hildur is the main focus in this film and does very well. The scenery is great along with Brynja Thora Gudnadóttir and Davíð Örn Halldórsson. I think the film could have been longer and with more dialect. I liked this film cause I have always wanted to live in Iceland and learn Icelandic. And they do very well in capturing the coldness and blankness Iceland seems to have there.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
