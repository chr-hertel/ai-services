It\u0027s South Park and it\u0027s the most genius idea ever thought of. I mean, who hasn\u0027t seen it? And the better question is, who hasn\u0027t loved it at the same time? South Park is great in every way. From the smut jokes to the vulgar cursing, it\u0027s great. In fact there isn\u0027t one person in my house that hasn\u0027t laughed at South Park at one point. (Who couldn\u0027t like the Michael Jackson parody?)Everyone I know loves South Park and fans are growing by the second. So if you haven\u0027t seen it, I suggest you start sitting in front of the TV for hours......or at least until it comes on. You have a lot of catching up to do. And if you don\u0027t like it, then maybe you shouldn\u0027t be here. And if you do, then thank you, you have made this the best show ever!\n\nSo for starters, this show is about four 8-year-old boys, Stan Marsh, Eric Cartman, Kenny McCormick, and Kyle Broflovski. They are all some of many of the strange, dysfunctional residents of the redneck mountain town of South Park, Colorado. Along with some other great background characters such as the coffee-addicted Tweek, Stan\u0027s ex-girlfriend Wendy, Mr. Hankey the Christmas poo, and Chef, South Park is one awesome show." }
