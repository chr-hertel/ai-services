It is essentially about a man who awakes to realise his wife hasn\u0027t come home from work the day before, and what happens to him during the day while he waits for the police. The movie never leaves the man\u0027s house, apart from a very short scene in a hospital, and contains no soundtrack. By doing this it creates more tension than if it had a typical Hollywood soundtrack, made up of the usual scary music and screeching sounds. Also as the house begins to fall apart, it becomes more and more claustrophobic. The fact that the storyline is fluid and ambiguous could infuriate or bore some people, however it is chilling without resulting to blood or gore, and never even gives any real answers. Though nowhere near as good, it resembles a David Lynch movie, in that it challenges conventions of plot, and remains ambiguous throughout. Don\u0027t watch for any out and out shocks, but it is a movie that will grow on you, and one that you\u0027ll still be thinking about later.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
