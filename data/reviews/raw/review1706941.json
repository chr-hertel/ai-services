Apparently DVDs from \"The Film Movement Series\" are a monthly independent film release and come with a short movie as well. Not bad for a DVD extra! This is a super-simple little film with a minimum of dialog. The film begins in what looks like a hospital or nursing home. A resident named \"Henry\" is wheelchair-bound and says nothing, but he spends most of the movie trying to slowly escape--even though each time, the tough nurse stops him and returns him to his room. In some ways it looked like a live version of a Warner Brothers cartoon, as the action seems pretty silly at first, but over time the real motivations become apparent and the film delivers a nice fitting conclusion.\n\nConsidering it\u0027s only about 10 minutes long, what can it hurt?! Give it a try.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
