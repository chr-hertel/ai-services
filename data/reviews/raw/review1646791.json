I had just started watching the old show (Flip This House) and loved it until all this other started up and I really don\u0027t care for the others (no heart, or class).\n\nWe loved the new shows so far and enjoyed Richard getting his hands dirty, its not exactly something he does every week and trying to put all the chemicals into the pool.\n\nMy husband started laughing about the air-conditioner falling out of the window when he opened it, said it would be something he would do to. He was wondering about the rest of the crew also. I miss seeing Kevin and the stuff he gets into. GREAT JOB!!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
