Mulan and Shang are now engaged. As they begin to plan their wedding, they\u0027re sent off on a mission from the Emporer to help transport his 3 daughters to their arranged marriage. Meanwhile, Mushu tries to split up our happy couple.\n\nFortunitely, this sequel doesn\u0027t ruin the first one. Mulan is still strong willed and free thinking. Mushu still brings the comic relief. The new songs are mediocre. this movie was still a waste of time and should have been left alone.\n\nOverall, not horrible, but not worth the time either 4/10\n\nrecommend if: *you need something to entertain the kids\n\navoid if: *the first Mulan is in stock", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
