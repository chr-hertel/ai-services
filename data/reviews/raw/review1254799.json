To call it the worst British comedy series of all time is probably wrong, because a show this bad, this staggeringly unfunny, cannot rightly be called a comedy at all. Enfield plays a very poorly disguised Ozzie Osbourne, and the mercifully brief run of the series follows his \u0027zany\u0027 and \u0027madcap\u0027 misadventures in the world of rock and roll royalty. \u0027Celeb\u0027 has all the clichés...a dour butler, a sexy female lead, a dopey workshy son...and the total lack of anything approaching humour shows just why these clichés became clichés in the first place. Enfield, who has a modest amount of talent, totally blows his street cred here in his \u0027portrayal\u0027 of the Ozzie-clone rock god. Apparently, Enfield believes that all you need to do is yell every line at ear-splitting volume and make funny faces and the comedy will just work itself out. If this is so, he is sadly mistaken. The scripts are just *not funny*. There is no other way to describe them. In a mark of how desperate the people who made this televisual atrocity are to get people to watch it, they have the female lead dress in kinky outfits in almost every episode. I love T\u0026A as much as the next man, but it\u0027s not enough. Oh, and she shouts a lot, too. The son doesn\u0027t shout much, but then that\u0027s a blessing. Most of the time, he seems embarrassed to be in the damn thing. There\u0027s a vague allusion to Posh and Becks in there amongst the rampant textual poaching from \u0027The Osbournes\u0027, but all this does is demonstrate that a fictional show about or press coverage of dimwit famous people is the only thing less watchable than a show about real ones. \n\nUtter, utter garbage from a man who is capable of much better. If\u0027 there is a worse sitcom out there, I\u0027d love to see it. Although I will admit that New Zealand\u0027s equivalent to Celeb, \u0027Melody Rules\u0027, exceeds Enfield\u0027s show in awfulness. This is because the company that made MR shot 44 episodes of it before anyone realised it was the worst TV show in history.\n\nAvoid. Even if you love Enfield. AVOID." }
