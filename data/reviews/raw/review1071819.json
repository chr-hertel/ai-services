The first half of this movie is fantastic, especially when they decide to build a ship to put into the force field they\u0027ve managed to create. They get bits and pieces from a junk yard to create the ship and outfit it with gear and provisions. They then do test runs like any good scientists would before they decide it\u0027s ready for a much bigger journey. It\u0027s every kid\u0027s dream, a ship that can take them anywhere they want to go. It\u0027s such a great build-up to an exciting adventure...\n\nbut once they end up taking the ship into space you might at as well turn it off. A complete shift in tone and intelligence. The final act of this movie is an enormous let down. Still the first half is great fun. Watching it again on DVD reminded me of why I loved and hated it so much as a kid.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
