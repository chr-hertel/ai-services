I don\u0027t like the book very much because I obviously compared it to Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter books and they beat Eragon at all. However the I found the trailer pretty good and so I decided to go and see the movie: a big mistake that I regret. There isn\u0027t any plot in this and the movie doesn\u0027t seem to be the adaptation of Eragon, but a squalid C category movie. So, after seeing Eragon who is (was?) supposed to be the rival of Harry Potter I can definitely say that Harry Potter beats Eragon both as book and as movie. In order to understand the lack of coherence in the plot, I have to make an answer: have writers of the movie read Eragon?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
