It is the only political show on PBS.\n\nWithout this show PBS would likely forced to be reborn since it generally has such a powerfully left-wing bias.\n\nThe narrator, John McLaughlin is a roughly non-partisan figure who really hosts the show. He does it in a novel manner that makes the show more interesting. He may be a Libertarian... as he falls into left and right camps with a tendency to visit the right.\n\nTypical hosts include Pat Buchanan and others. Mr. Buchanan is obviously conservative. He has a chick counterpart who covers the left territory in an equally abrasive manner. The two co-hosts complement John McLaughlin who then puts them in their place by reminding them that they live in America, not Liberica or Conservica! It is quite interesting to watch- especially occasionally and over a period of years, even decades as I have.\n\nIssues commonly discussed include American foreign policy and domestic security issues. It\u0027s often suggested that the U.S. get out of everywhere and focus the heck on it\u0027s own problems. This is an attitude that non-baby boomers (younger set) may find very appealing.\n\nSpeaking of that generational issues have over the years been brought up in the show. The guests tend to have very optimistic views of the future and their own take on how that future will be brighter than before.\n\nThere is a general feeling from within the show that the left is viewed as being on it\u0027s way to obsolescence with the right redefining a new left and right based on rational thought and modern life.\n\nHowever it should be said that this show definitely represents all views. It is one of the only TV shows aired anywhere that really discusses all sides of the political equation." }
