Possibly the film could have been better after several script rewrites, but I doubt it. I wonder if the writers were aware of how bad the script was; looking back, Gary Winston\u0027s line, \"Show some creativity!\" (spoken to the company\u0027s lawyers), strikes me as ironically appropriate if applied to the movie as a whole. The plot seems a crude and obvious attempt to dramatize the battle between closed-source and open-source software, plainly ripping off the Microsoft antitrust case and adding a conspiratorial element that is highly derivative of Grisham\u0027s \"The Firm.\" Creativity is not the only thing the movie is missing -- it also lacks plot coherence, convincing acting, realism of the computer and security systems, non-distracting camera effects... I could go on, but won\u0027t because it\u0027s not worth the time and energy.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
