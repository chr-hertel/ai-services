He has taken the WIP genre and added a twist of his own.\n\nThe girls are kidnapped from a brothel and taken to an island prison. There they undertake a modest degree of insubordinate behaviour which triggers obligatory punishment. This consists of having to strip and walk around naked in the prison for the rest of the film. And what can you say against that? What with nude wrestling, nude whipping and a nude escape project, it\u0027s all a go-go.\n\nSure the acting is weak and the plot rattles, but that is not what we are here for. It delivers what it says on the tin. Big time.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
