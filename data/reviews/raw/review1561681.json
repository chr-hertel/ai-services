Consindering that it was from 2003 I don\u0027t understand why a star like bloom would ever agree to such a script. Maybe it was the directors fault but I really didn\u0027t like the acting, and I\u0027ve seen what bloom can do \"kingdom of heaven\" and this was nothing.\n\nThe story was lacking, the acting not very convincing and I really did not feel for this film. Bought it, and probably wont see it again unless I got serious hangovers and already have seen all the good stuff.\n\nOrlando was very childes and the performance didn\u0027t look whole hearted. Some of the supporting acting was okay.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
