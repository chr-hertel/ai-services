Should now be released on DVD", "reviewBody": "I watched this mini series when it was first aired on UK TV and I\u0027m amazed it\u0027s never been released either on video or latterly on DVD. Robert Vaughn is superb in his role as a sinister \u0027background\u0027 character to the downward spiralling president.\n\nJason Robards, in one of his better acted roles, is also very believable as the president who is initially tarnished, then eventually dethroned by corruption.\n\nI think the time has come for another generation to enjoy this excellent production - I can\u0027t imagine why it\u0027s never even been aired again by any of the major TV companies.\n\nSo therefore - please somebody - get it out on DVD!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
