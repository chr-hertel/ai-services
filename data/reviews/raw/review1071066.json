Small things that might get overlooked like a scene where two actors converse on a bench and the American flag waves proudly in a windows reflection are a delight.\n\nThe score is a wonderful compliment to the visuals and really sets the movies tone.\n\nOn the fringe is a nice little indie movie that isn\u0027t so small. It\u0027s amazing how much of the town the film makers must have covered. Lot\u0027s of exterior shots that really showoff the small town landscape.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
