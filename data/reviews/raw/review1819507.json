In \"A Peck o\u0027 Trouble\", lazy Dodsworth wants to eat a woodpecker for breakfast, but the woodpecker lives in a tall tree, which Dodsworth refuses to climb (after all, no member of his family has ever stooped to physical labor). So, as in \"Kiddin\u0027 the Kitten\", Dodsworth pretends to teach a class on catching the animal, and teaches a kitten how to do it (in the first cartoon, the kitten was white; here he\u0027s yellow). But sure enough, things don\u0027t go quite as Dodsworth planned.\n\nAt first glance, this is a neat look at turning a dishonest situation upside down. But also, it shows that - contrary to what some people have written in other reviews - Robert McKimson directed many good shorts. When Warner Bros. had to close one of its animation units in the late 1940s, it\u0027s a good thing that they kept open McKimson\u0027s unit; without it, we wouldn\u0027t have Foghorn Leghorn, Hippety Hopper and the Tasmanian Devil.* Anyway, I just get a kick out of what happens to the languid Dodsworth. He\u0027s like a feline version of Foghorn Leghorn. Worth seeing.\n\nPS: Sheldon Leonard, who provided Dodsworth\u0027s voice, produced \"The Danny Thomas Show\", \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\".\n\n*In all fairness to Arthur Davis (whose unit they discontinued), he had a pretty interesting record, namely \"Bowery Bugs\"." }
