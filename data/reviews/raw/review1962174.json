I found myself impatiently waiting for the twenty minute short to conclude. Not soon enough for me. Agonizingly bad stuff, dated and cornball from start to finish and a bit crude in the style of humor.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
