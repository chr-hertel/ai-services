There were moments when you may feel yourself turning away as a cliché becomes unbelievably corny and predictable but the fights and plot will have your eyes glued to the screen for almost 2 hours of running time.\n\nThe direction by Minkoff is good, bizarre but intriguing in justifying the character\u0027s actions and reactions. I\u0027ve personally never been a big fan of CGI, but when used here is used to maximum effect making it a spectacle of bright lights and magic.\n\nI wondered after watching; whether the film would have been better in Chinese with subtitles, just to add a bit more intensity and surprise to certain scenes, just an after thought really. But still good in English, all actors did well, though Angarano plays a complete teenage stereotype I found it embarrassing to watch at some points.\n\nThough critics have said the plot does follow an American young hero who must save the day and defeat the odds etc, there is still magic and interest to the tale, plus the choreography and visual effects add to the intensity of the situations and if you look past all the clichés then it is an enjoyable fighting fantasy film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
