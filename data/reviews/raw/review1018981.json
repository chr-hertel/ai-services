It keeps you in suspense all the way through, and there certainly are a few twists within the plot as the film goes along, that I certainly didn\u0027t expect. Some scenes might make you uncomfortable, (even a little sick!) and others might make you jump, but to me, what gives this film it\u0027s originality, is the actual plot.....I haven\u0027t seen another horror film deliver the story quite like this one....\n\nA good thrilling film.\n\nI must say, that I heard they were making a sequel, and I think that\u0027s a bad idea.....After watching till the end of the film, it would be much scarier if they just left it, which when you have watched it, you might see why...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
