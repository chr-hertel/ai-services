From here we see her downfall, which starts with her getting pregnant and this eventually leads to her meeting two weirdos who like taking pictures of violent crimes.\n\nFEMALE TROUBLE was the follow-up to PINK FLAMINGOS and I\u0027ve heard several interview with Waters where he talks about why he didn\u0027t want this film to try and top that one. It\u0027s clear that this film doesn\u0027t reach the same vulgar and shocking levels of PINK FLAMINGOS but at the same time I think a lot of people are going to be disappointed that it doesn\u0027t quite reach the same grossness.\n\nI think the greatest things going on in the film is the performance by Divine. Not only does he get the top role but he also gets to play a supporting part and he actually does a nice job with both of them. The Dawn character he plays is quite memorable and especially when you consider that we really do get to see her at various stages of her life. I really thought Divine did a great job in the part and he managed to make it his own. Several of Waters\u0027 regulars appear including Edith Massey who even gets a nude scene!\n\nThe film contains some pretty \"bad\" moments in regards to the sleaze including one sequence where a dad tries to have sex with his daughter. I thought FEMALE TROUBLE had some funny moments scattered throughout but at the same time I think it\u0027s fair to call it a disappointment. At 97-minutes the film runs way too long and in all honesty there wasn\u0027t enough laughs to make it a complete success." }
