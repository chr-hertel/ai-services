The film is totally gripping and Forrest Wittaker is superb as the dictator. I didn\u0027t stop watching the film for one second throughout you simply couldn\u0027t. Both Whittaker\u0027s and the Scottish doctor are very charming characters particularly Whittaker\u0027s in the beginning.\n\nIts rare to see such a fantastic film as this which moves at a nice pace pealing away the layer of the dictators true persona and having such a great cast and great acting as well.\n\nIts a pity Gillian Andersons character didn\u0027t get more time on screen as shes such a great actress and of course beautiful.\n\nA superb film 9/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
