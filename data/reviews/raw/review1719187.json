In fact if anything it struck me as a very well crafted old fashioned romantic film at heart (in a good way). This is really probably not the film you think it is.\n\nHigh points. The cast is excellent, absolutely all on top form for every character. The direction, photography and use of music are top notch - everything seems to hit the right note perfectly. You start out thinking you\u0027ll see a crass comedy and end up seeing a very skillfully made film, with likable characters and a really good heart at the core of it. It\u0027s also extremely funny! Low points. It\u0027s very much a fantasy film and very romantic. In this sense it really doesn\u0027t touch on it\u0027s supposed core theme \u0027the porn industry\u0027 in any realistic way. Porn producers are lovable rogues. AIDS is never mentioned. The whole thing is so wholesome! I don\u0027t really think this is a low point as the film is essentialy a romantic fantasy and the portrayal of the porn characters is very funny and in no way meant to be realistic.\n\nI really enjoyed it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
