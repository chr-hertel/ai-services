Many of the vantage points were a waste with so-so acting. Certain characters were ridiculous and unnecessary ( i.e. the little girl). Poor Forrest Whittaker had a silly role in this movie and his acting abilities were wasted.I enjoyed the way the clock restarted at 12:00 for each vantage point I thought it kept things cohesive. While some of the characters were unnecessary this movie still proved to be moderately entertaining with some decent suspense and action scenes. The end is a nice twist but I think this may be a renter.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
