He knew or still knows some of the individuals that are in this movie as they are in real life. It\u0027s a mostly true portrayal of actual events. They did actually go to the concert that was portrayed in the movie and many others in the long run. If some think that it\u0027s a bad remake of \"One Flew over the Cuckoo\u0027s Nest, I wish just for one day they could live Mike\u0027s life. You\u0027d no longer criticize this movie. For those of you that can\u0027t forget the movie, I\u0027m glad that it\u0027s made that type of an impact and I hope when you see someone like Mike you offer assistance. \n\nI also encourage people to get involved as there are still people living like Mike was. Our government has laws in place that keep people trapped in nursing homes instead of being able to be productive members of society. Just because a person\u0027s body doesn\u0027t work like most doesn\u0027t mean they don\u0027t have a mind.
