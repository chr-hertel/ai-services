This 60 minute set of early Bill Plympton shorts is a must-see for animation freaks, but since it\u0027s not his latest stuff, such wonderful shorts as GUIDE DOG and PARKING aren\u0027t included. Most of the shorts are \"fall on the floor laughing\" funny and only a crabby old curmudgeon couldn\u0027t enjoy these films! \n\n25 WAYS TO QUIT SMOKING has a few reviews that complained that some of the ways weren\u0027t all that funny. However, even when when a few of the ways weren\u0027t great, each segment appeared so quickly one after the other that I really don\u0027t think this was a problem. If one seemed a bit disappointing, you know that the next is bound to make you laugh out loud---and laugh out loud I did several times, as many of the \"solutions\" were very sadistic and cruel--just the sort of stuff I love!! \n\nFunny, irreverent and exceptionally well made--this is a must-see for any fan of animation.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
