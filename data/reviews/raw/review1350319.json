Mendoza from his music. I didn\u0027t even know what he looked like. This movie blew my mind. If Ghost World were a musical, and They Might Be Giants helped out, you\u0027d have Colma.\n\nIt feels like no other musical I\u0027ve ever seen. It has that alternative edge that a lot of other musicals claim to have. And I don\u0027t mean alternative like Nickelback. I mean like that alternative sound that\u0027s been alternative since the eighties.\n\nAnd the characters are so free and trapped at the same time. Every character has some major faults, but you can\u0027t help but like them all. Rent wishes it were this realistic.\n\nI swear, if you like They Might Be Giants, Cake, Presidents of the USA, and all of those bands like that, you will absolutely love Colma: The Musical.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
