He learns from his mistake to not use a gun. Now he, with his friend, robs a jewelery store. Once leaving the diamond in a lady\u0027s purse, the duo tries to get it back by making the short criminal, Calvin, a baby, which the lady and her husband always wanted.\n\nFirst off, in my opinion, I found this film funny. It\u0027s not as funny as White Chicks but it\u0027s funny and it\u0027s a good film. It\u0027s certainly not the worst film. I\u0027m probably one of the people who like these films. The others would probably hate it.\n\nThe acting is decent in the film. The technology of putting Marlon Wayans\u0027 head on top of Linden Porco\u0027s body is good. They sure spent most of their time doing it and it paid off.\n\nThe jokes are funny and clever at some times. There are some usual fart jokes and physical humor, which is fine by me. It\u0027s not nearly as bad as I thought people have said it was. It\u0027s not even close to being a bad film. There are even some sweet moments in this film. I am NOT joking!\n\nWhat will the Wayans think of next? First, a spoof, next, two black men in white make-up, and now this?! It\u0027s amazing. This is just entirely my opinion. You may disagree me as much as you want. I don\u0027t care. I thought this film was funny and sweet. You may think it\u0027s just a horrible comedy and think of why would they spend so much time and money in this project. Agree with me or not, I thought this film was funny. If you liked White Chicks, you would certainly like this film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
