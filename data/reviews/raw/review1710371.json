Barry Morse\u0027s words from that show could equally have served as Taylor\u0027s bywords, \"I don\u0027t philosophize, I hunt.\"\n\nWho he\u0027s hunting is the last man of a four man gang accused of a holdup where a death occurred. Two guys are already dead and one is sentenced to hang. But nobody knows who number four is or what he looks like.\n\nTaylor in his quest goes to an army post where he finds recent widow Tina Louise and he\u0027s authorized by Wells Fargo to offer a reward of $500.00 if she\u0027ll come to a town where he\u0027s reputed to be and point him out. \n\nWhen he arrives in town, the object of his quest who turns out to be Jack Lord is about the most popular fellow there. Why he didn\u0027t run for mayor or even for Fess Parker\u0027s job as sheriff is beyond me. But Taylor gets no help from anybody.\n\nThe title derives from the nickname Taylor has acquired for his dogged dedication to duty. The Hangman is a western with very little action surprisingly, but it has a good character study by the mature Robert Taylor. It\u0027s a well rounded portrait of a man who\u0027d like to leave the job he\u0027s in, but has grown used to it and it\u0027s the only living he\u0027s known for years.\n\nThe Hangman was the first film Robert Taylor did outside MGM since Magnificent Obsession in the Thirties. He has a record, definitely unlikely to be broken now of the longest running studio contract in film history. \n\nThe Hangman is a good, not great western besides those already mentioned I did enjoy Mabel Albertson\u0027s performance as a dotty old biddy who\u0027s eying Robert Taylor like a slab of romantic beef. Well he was one of the biggest screen heartthrobs ever. \n\nPersonally, I think Taylor should have concentrated on westerns in his later years the same way Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott did. He liked making them and though he\u0027s not primarily known as a western star, films like Devil\u0027s Doorway, Saddle the Wind, The Last Hunt and The Law and Jake Wade hold up very well today. The Hangman\u0027s not as good as these I\u0027ve mentioned, but it still has a fine performance from Robert Taylor and the rest of the cast.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
