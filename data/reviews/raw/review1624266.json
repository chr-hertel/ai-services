After Vincent shoots Crowe in the stomach and kills himself, Crowe can\u0027t stop thinking about it. A few months later he is hired to help a troubled boy named Cole Sear, who has many of the same problems Vincent had. Crowe sees a chance to redeem himself, but doubts his ability to reach the boy, particularly when Cole claims to see ghosts who don\u0027t know they\u0027re dead.\n\nRight off, I\u0027ll say this is one of the best films ever. It currently ranks #3 for M. Night\u0027s films. I love this movie because it\u0027s a really good ghost story and has a thought-provoking plot.\n\nYeah, this film was famous so I already knew the ending before it even happened but that didn\u0027t distract me from watching the movie. Throughout the movie is a masterpiece.\n\nThe acting by Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, and Toni Collette were all fantastic and some like Olivia Williams and Donnie Wahlberg were all great, too.\n\nIf you want an intelligent ghost movie with some scares and twists and turns, this is the movie for you. It\u0027s not just a plain old stupid scary movie. It has a story and great acting.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
