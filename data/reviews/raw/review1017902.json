That\u0027s what \"Thérèse Raquin\", an extraordinary mini series aired in the US around 1980 or 81, has. The two leads sexual appetites are so openly displayed and animal like that everything that follows seems absolutely correct and plausible. There\u0027s such a carnality in their sex that it\u0027s breathless. When the plot thickens and murder enters the scene, it\u0027s with a sickened heart that you know all are doomed.\n\nThis is not for the faint hearted or easily offended. Yep, it\u0027s a \"Masterpiece Theater\" presentation but DO NOT expect the normally stuffy, stiff upper lipped Brit presented. This is more akin to \"Body Heat\" or \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\".\n\nSee it. You will not forget it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
