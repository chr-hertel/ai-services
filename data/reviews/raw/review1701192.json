First, this is not a ho-hum, boring movie. An earthquake cripples a Russian power plant threatening a meltdown, and it\u0027s a race against time to avert the disaster. Add into the mix a Russian supervisor who refuses to accept the idea of anything wrong, and will stop at nothing to keep the truth from getting out, even if it means locking the engineer near the core, and trying to run away when confronted with the truth. That is very believable. This movie is well-paced, and doesn\u0027t take long to get started. And once it gets going, you\u0027re on a roller-coaster ride of suspense. The scene in the elevator shaft reminds me of the suspense in TOWERING INFERNO and POSEIDON ADVENTURE. The kids are very believable American youngsters trying to deal with their parents\u0027 separation, and fate forces them to work together. Maybe it\u0027s all clich√©, maybe not. But I like this movie. Maybe the special effects were taken from DANTE\u0027S PEAK, I don\u0027t know. Frankly, I don\u0027t care, since they\u0027re very brief and quick. Only when scenes are obviously stolen from other movies do I care, like when they stole footage from AIRPORT 1975 to create SONIC IMPACT. But try it yourself. You may be surprised.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
