Ain\u0027t fair.\"", "reviewBody": "The first thing that struck me about The Killing is that the narration really doesn\u0027t seem to fit, which explains why Kubrick was so unhappy about being obliged to include it. My initial reaction upon learning this was to wonder why Kubrick would put up with someone forcing him to do something in one of his films that he didn\u0027t like, but then I remembered that this was very early in his career, and no one really knew who he was yet. \n\nRight away we meet an obviously unhappy couple, Sherry and George, and quickly learn why they are unhappy. Sherry has no respect for George because he had promised her a good life and a lot of money and has as of yet failed to do that. She belittles him and manipulates him, treating him like an irritating servant rather than as a husband. It is painfully obvious that he should drop her like a bad habit, but he is so in love with her that he takes it and continues to make her promises, even knowing that in order to fulfill them he will have to take a dangerous trip to the wrong side of the law.\n\nThe build-up of the scheme to rob the race track is one of the film\u0027s greatest achievements, and Sherry manages to manipulate George into telling her about it, and then she immediately goes off to tell her lover about it as well. It is an interesting love triangle described here. Sherry is having an affair with a handsome stud but married to a whiny pansy who reminds me of Piglet from the Winnie the Pooh cartoons. George is desperately in love with Sherry, who has no respect for him, but is in turn in love with Val, a handsome man who clearly is only interested in her physically. At least until she mentions George\u0027s scheme to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars. Then he\u0027s interested in her financially, too. We know Sherry plans to betray George, and we can sense that Val intends to betray Sherry, which makes for some great dramatic tension later in the film. \n\nGeorge is so intent on getting to trust his promise that things will get better that he doesn\u0027t think for a second that she would ever betray him, even when she is so clearly uninterested in him beyond the possibility that he may bring some money into her life. At one point he tells her, \"I know I\u0027ve made a lot of promises in the past, but this time it\u0027s not just talk. We\u0027re gonna be rich, and soon!\" This may have been emulated in a classic Simpsons episode, where Homer says almost exactly the same thing  \"After years of failing at get-rich-quick schemes, I KNOW I\u0027m gonna get rich with THIS scheme. And quick!\"\n\nKubrick has explored an astonishing variety of genres in his career, ranging from the beginning of time to the distant future and from sports films to science fiction. This one, I think, is his only film noir, and it is film noir by the strictest definition. I often notice that, with surprising regularity, it is women, or a woman, the generates much of the conflict in the movies, but here is a very clearly defined femme fatale that leads to the downfall of a doting man. \n\n(spoilers) There is a scene that suggests an ugly hint of racism, as the man hired to shoot one of the horses during the race (and thus create the necessary distraction) tells a polite black parking lot attendant to get lost in the ugliest way possible. I was a little disappointed to hear this kind of language in a Kubrick film, although it does fit in perfectly with the story and, more importantly, these are the last words the man ever says. Serves him right. This is Kubrick making social commentary in his own brilliant way. Very soon, he does it again, skewering corrupt or inept police and biased news outlets, which claim that the man was shot as he \"attempted to shoot his way out of the parking lot.\" \n\nAs can be expected, everything does not turn out to plan, and Kubrick has created a brilliant ending that is both disappointing and hugely satisfying. Disappointing because the tension was created throughout by causing us to wonder whether or not the robbery would be successful, and satisfying because, even though we didn\u0027t really even notice it until now, none of the characters are very likable. Except maybe for that parking lot attendant. After all that planning, it seems, you can\u0027t account for every contingency\n\nNote: The eagle-eyed viewer will notice Rodney Dangerfield as an extra during the fight scene. I may be mistaken, but it looks to me like he is the man the second from the right just after the guy fighting flips two cops forward onto their backs at once.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
