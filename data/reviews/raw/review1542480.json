I\u0027ve then read on here about how \"this\" was wrong, or \"x\" doesn\u0027t do it that way, or blah blah blah.\n\nWhat I have to say in response to that is this: The military adviser for this film was Harry Humphries. He is an ex SEAL. I would think that alone would be enough to determine the tactics used in the film. Harry on the making of Tears of the Sun specifically says that he wanted the tactics and techniques used to be real, the way its done. Here is his biography: Highest rank: E-6; first-class petty officer. Speciality: weapons and demolition Highest rank: E-6; first-class petty officer. Speciality: weapons and demolition Did two tours in Southeast Asia, one with Dick Marcinko in SEAL Team Two, Eight Platoon, one as a PRU adviser. Severely wounded during second tour. Served in UDT (Underwater Demolition Team) 22 and SEAL Team Two. Went through UDT training (UDTR, Underwater Demolition Team Replacement) in Class 29. That was before BUD/S was created.\n\nWith that said, argue as much as you like about it - but, this guy knows what he\u0027s doing. Now - I\u0027m taking it on face value that he used correct techniques for the film, but based on the fact that he said so, and he felt it would be important to do so -- I\u0027ll go with that." }
