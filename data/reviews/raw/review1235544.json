He and Anthony Anderson, who plays his CIA \"handler\" in this sequel, were obviously having fun making this campy tongue-in-cheek secret agent \"thriller.\" This is a very simple movie -- there are no sub-plots, no complicated characters, no psychological complexities -- and I couldn\u0027t help but enjoy it. If you\u0027re willing, for a moment or two, to accept that a 16-y/o boy in the middle of an immense plush bed would tell a very attractive girl who comes to visit him in the morning to just leave him alone and go away, then you can enjoy it too! The silliness extends from the opening scene of a CIA \"summer camp\" for pint-size agents-in-training to Cody discovering that Scotland Yard has a junior agent program of their own. With all that, or perhaps in spite of all that, there\u0027s something so unassuming about Frankie Muniz that you WANT to join him in his far-fetched world. Even as a child actor he was never especially \"pretty\" in the way that so many of them are, so he really must have had, and continues to have, some talent. I hope he can carry the same relaxed aplomb into a successful adult career.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
