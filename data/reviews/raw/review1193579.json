You never saw anything, but then again you never had to.\n\nEven the word \u0027beasts\u0027 takes us all back there doesn\u0027t it? I try and be objective. I saw this in late 1976, and never since. I was 9 years old, hardly capable of critical reasoning. Yet, across the gulf of time, images and thought processes immeasurably superior to adulthood come back to you.\n\nI\u0027d like to watch it now, provided it don\u0027t ruin it." }
