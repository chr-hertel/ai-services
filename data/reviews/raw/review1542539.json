This movie is amazing!!!!!!!!!!! It has a lot of action......... a lot of action, a great story that is true to the comic book, and great acting. Frank Castle is an FBI agent. During an undercover operation, a mob boss\u0027s son is killed. The mob boss seeks revenge and kills Castle\u0027s entire family at a reunion. Frank Castle barely survives and seeks to punish the mob boss for what he did. He gets an apartment and tracks down the mob boss to punish him. This movie is so good!!!! I think Thomas Jane was perfect for Frank Castle. And John Travolta made a very good Howard Saint (mob boss) I cannot wait for The Punisher 2: War Zone!!!\n\nAmazing movie!!!!!!!!!! especially the extended director\u0027s cut. It adds to the story more and gets more in depth with Frank Castle.\n\ndefinitely recommend it!!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
