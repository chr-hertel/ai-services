An adventure where you visit other Earths, and see what could have been if something even slightly changed in history.... Having \"life-altering\" situations crop up, then lacking cable, I lost track after the 3rd season. I agree that the change in cast hurt the show, but it\u0027s inevitable in any series that lasts more than a couple of years anymore. People don\u0027t want to get stuck in a role and have to play that for most of the rest of their acting careers. Star Trek showed how great it can be for the fans, but somewhat devastating for serious actors. I also think that the idea of other sliders was a logical step after several episodes, but may have been handled a little better if the writers had more sway over the execs. After all, if the \"Other Quinn\" in the first episode hadn\u0027t shown up (according to the script/plot) the show would never have happened, right? He gave \"our Quinn\" the timer. Unfortunately, like \"Nowhere Man\", the show had to change directions in order to stay on the air. Unlike \"Nowhere Man\", \"Sliders\" gathered enough momentum to continue for several seasons. I applaud the efforts of the production crew and writers to try to get a happy medium between pleasing us fans and appeasing the execs, but eventually it had to come to an end. One thing I will express a great deal of appreciation over, though, is that the complete seasons are being released, so that we can all watch and enjoy the parts we liked...." }
