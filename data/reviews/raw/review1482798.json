And finally, I saw the movie, and I was disappointed. It is about the other person\u0027s revenge for Dr.Lecter. The Mason, who cut his face skin himself, has a hatred for Hannibal Lecter as he raises many pigs which can eat human. But, his ready of revenge was nothing after all;his revenge got failed because of Starling\u0027s disturbance. And when you see this movie, you\u0027ll see the most disgusting scene in Lecter series. That is the scene that people eat human\u0027s brain. It\u0027s not horrible, but just disgusting movie. Hannibal never shows us his genius about crime and only his cruelty shows brightness.\n\nI\u0027ve never seen the Lecter series as its novel. If I get those, I want to see them. But, I don\u0027t want to be disappointed again. As I mentioned, the movie just make the original worse. Am I only one who feel it seems his genius madness became as a psycho person?" }
