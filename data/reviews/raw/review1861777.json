The larger point of the film is not thats there\u0027s a ID and a God, but that PURE scientific and rational pursuits of research are being oppressed and suppressed by a new crop of secular elitists. And that is a fact....not a theory. To listen to your contrarian counterpoints is to hear nothing more than snide detractions rather than denial of the above facts. Obviously none of these \u0027science snobs\u0027 are able to sustain a withering critique of their positions and their powerful and oppressive regimes. Let\u0027s see what these anarchical anti-God scientific Torquemada\u0027s can \u0027cook\u0027 up to meet the scathing criticism from this expose\u0027 of their nonsensical counterpoints. I hope Mel Brooks does a movie exposing them as well." }
