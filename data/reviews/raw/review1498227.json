As an instructor in digital film-making, I have shown this film to several classes, often to focus on completely different aspects of it, ie: the cinematography, editing, story, and content. The uncannily poetic imagery, juxtaposed with difficult subject matter produce an effect that simultaneously suspends disbelief and increases fascination to a degree unheard of in this type of film. Nkara never compromises what she wants to say, and yet, this film is never preachy, has no agenda, and communicates always first and foremost from the heart. It is also sublimely beautiful, with the spare elegance of a haiku, yet unpretentious and accessible to all. It is difficult to describe what happens to a person watching this film..a truly unique and important cinematic experience.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
