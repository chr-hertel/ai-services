I love all of Kubricks\u0027 work especially this one. The Shining is one great movie. The characters\u0027 and then makers couldn\u0027t have made a better film. When I first saw it I was scared to death. It\u0027s one freaky movie with a great story line and action. There was never a dull moment. Surprises\u0027 were around every corner in the movie. Kubrick and King provided everything for a awesome movie with a mood that makes you feel scared but yet in some way you fell bad for the people stuck in the hotel. They couldn\u0027t have based the movie anywhere else besides where they did or it wouldn\u0027t be as good because the surroundings and weather help the story develop. If you even like horror movies, you have got to see this one!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
