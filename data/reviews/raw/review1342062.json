My high expectations have been fulfilled and I will add this Oscar nominated work for best foreign language film no doubt to my best of DVD collection. It\u0027s fast paced with lot of emotional, dramatic and action scenes and I never got bored. Sometimes I had even to laugh on some ridiculous decisions of Hitler. I have to admit that there were perhaps too many bloody suicides in this story. Anyway, director Hirschbiegel shows in a very authentic way the dramatic end of the third Reich. I am also surprised how great Bruno Ganz was in characterizing Hitler so deep and with its voice. All the humanity should never forget that this murder is responsible for the death of millions of innocent people and I recommend to watch this documentation to every one. I hope there will never be a WWIII. Rating: 7.5/10.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
