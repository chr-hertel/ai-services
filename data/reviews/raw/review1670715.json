However publisher Bradford Meade changes this when he decides to hire a secretary for his son Daniel that he feels confident will not just become another sexual conquest for his offspring. And so the anti-fashion character of Betty Suarez enters the world of Mode  much to the irritation of Daniel. However her hard work and cheerful outlook win Daniel over, even if her colleagues see her as out of place and out of her depth. Both finding their feet though, Betty helps Daniel find his way through the treacherous world of Mode whether it be Wilhelmina Slater or the unseen hands of the mysterious masked woman.\n\nArriving in the UK on a wave of hype from the US, I tuned into Ugly Betty hoped that it would be an imaginative and funny affair not too dissimilar from My Name is Earl. This was my mistake but I quickly got passed in and settled into the comic spoof of the fashion world. And for the most part that is how this series gets by  on the comic charm of Betty and the parody of the high fashion world with all the easy targets that fill it. All this is well and good and makes for a nice piece of light entertainment but the series started to run out of novelty value and started to need more and more story.\n\nNow, from the start of the series I never really cared about the mystery woman or the secrets held by Bradford Meade and throughout the series I didn\u0027t even find it silly  just dull. It doesn\u0027t help that the series got more and more prone to melodrama and sentimentality. This is seen in the various character subplots that take away from the central silly and superficial antics of Betty within this world where she doesn\u0027t belong. The latter is really what makes the series enjoyable but the former are mostly poor because there is no depth to support them or characters to really care about. The performances are OK then when this light comic air is at the fore but mostly struggle when asked to do more. Ferrera is great in the lead, bringing out a great heart that is the core of the story in the middle of all the superficial \"beauty\" around her. Mabius is a lot weaker by comparison and shows nothing of the character that Betty seems to be able to see in his Daniel. Dale is a curious find for those of us in the UK who know him only from Neighbours. Williams is OK but she looks a lot older than she is which I suppose suits her character. Supporting turns from Jensen, Plana, Newton, Urie and others mostly are good value when the material gives them the chance to be.\n\nOverall then a reasonably amusing comedy drama that is better when it aims at the countless targets in the fashion world for comedy rather than trying to bring out a melodrama from the weak narrative in the background. Nowhere near as good as the hype will have you believe but sporadically amusing enough to dip into here and there." }
