Also, it\u0027s no good for pornography (you\u0027ll just feel dirtier) If you didn\u0027t understand it or thought it was pornographic, you\u0027re probably a \"normal\" person(and/or haven\u0027t seen a good porno), and thats okay. The meaning is explained pretty well by some of the other posts if you need help. \n\nBUT I JUST WANT TO SAY...the people who REALLY GET the movie probably wont be affected by it in the way that the writer intended. Because they would already have so many of their own ideas about American culture. And they would probably say, \"Yeah? So?\" \n\nDoes this make sense? \n\nMy Boring story I watched this on Cinnemax and I thought it was the newer movie by the same title, which a friend had recommended to me. If you\u0027ve seen this movie, you could imagine my surprise. At first I thought my friend had some issues. I soon realized of course, that it was a different movie.
