Video boom was on and this was off. Yes, this is what the Government film office was funding in its production arm for \u0027all the family\u0027. A great cast of Aussie favorites including the fantastic Ruth Cracknell and lovely young Claudia Karvan (DATING THE ENEMY) helped MOLLY limp along at the school holiday box office. There is a lot of sideshow music from Mick Conway and rattly piano and mouthorgan music with Molly herself yelping away with gusto. The title of the film is terrible and people didn\u0027t want to pay much to see it. The State film office folded a few years later and MOLLY disappeared along with it. Since then we made NAPOLEON the wandering puppy and PAWS the dog that can use a computer. MOLLY is a good kids pic and a DVD release would work well. The cast of humans especially will get it a good profile.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
