No dozing off in the last hour of this! Gotta say that Lesley Sharp\u0027s performance in this \u0027mini-series\u0027 (and yes, I too thought this was meant to be a \"series\" and hope it will be) was/is simply stunning, totally believable, and in the final hours....breath taking! I think she is right up there for me now as a \"favourite actor\", and I\u0027ve only ever noticed her in \u0027The Second Coming\u0027 before. Andrew Lincoln\u0027s performance as the learned, skeptical \"ghostbuster\" was outstanding also.\n\nI loved the USA\u0027s \"Medium\", but, in comparison, found this series to be a much darker, grittier, warts-and-all portrayal of what it\u0027s like to be \"blessed\" with a psychic ability. (Is there something in the name \"Alison\" too?? Hmm!) Bravo Lesley and Andrew on some of the BEST TV viewing I have seen all year! (Took my mind off the Brits winning the Ashes yesterday too! LOL!) 5***** from me also!" }
