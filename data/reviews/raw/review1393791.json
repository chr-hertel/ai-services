The effects were incredible, the monsters, environments, mist effects, etc, were all spot on.\n\nAll in all, if you loved the games, then you will love this movie. If you didn\u0027t then its a toss up between your own tastes and what Silent Hill offers, which is, in my opinion, well worth the price of admission.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
