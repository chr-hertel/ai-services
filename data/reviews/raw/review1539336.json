America reverts to the old west life style where bounty hunters go around killing zombies and turning in their finger for money. One player in the zombie bounty hunting profession gets greedy and comes up with his own immoral but financially sound plan to continue hunting zombies even though they are all but gone in there region of the country. The star has some secret on surviving the zombies and has several close calls. This is really meant to be a spaghetti western like film with a more modern backdrop. Nothing really good about this film, just a unique story give this film a C+ for me.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
