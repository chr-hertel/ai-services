An abandoned church is renovated into a police substation known as \"The Barn\". Fighting back from there are Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) and the Strike Team - a special gang task force that plays by its own rules including Shane (Walton Goggins), Lemonhead (Kenneth Johnson) and the rest (David Rees Snell) - head-strong detective Claudette (C.C.H. Pounder) and put-upon ace profiler Dutch (Jay Karnes), street cops Ronnie (Catherine Dent) and Julian (Michael Jace) and politically-minded captain Aceveta (Benito Martinez). Mackey is our wild card whose hot-tempered tactics include meeting thugs with creative torture, killing a fellow officer, dealing for information with street informants and isn\u0027t above pocketing money for himself on the side a cat-and-mouse game with potentially explosive consequences.\n\nComing out of nowhere from creator Shawn Ryan (\"Nash Bridges\"), \"The Shield\" has made a name for FX. Shot in a shaky-camera, documentary-style that makes it hard to peel the eyes away from and requires us not to, the show is about as engrossing and provocative as TV gets. The street battle between the cops and the various gangs is depicted like a war, which sprawls out over crack houses, front lawns, back gates and convenient stores waged for control of the territory. With stories involving elderly rape, pedophiles, child sex slaves, black-on-black lynching, and Armenian drug lords who take feet for trophies, it is not a show for the squeamish. Even the most jaded HBO viewer may find themselves uncomfortable with the topics we are confronted with. It is a powerful, barbed spanking machine that stings to the touch. \"The Shield\" is hands-down the most brutal show on TV.\n\nShedding every ounce of his doughy \"The Commish\" persona, and re-cutting himself in the mold of Mackey, Chiklis is a fire-breathing hurricane. He kicks in doors and beats up thugs, overlaying it all with a subtle feeling of inner torment. Sometimes he gets that wild look in his eyes like a school yard bully who can\u0027t believe he gets paid to do this; sometimes a quiver in his voice as those around him drift away and there is nothing he can do to get them back. The entire cast works like clockwork, even when the story gives them little to do - notably, Karnes who infuses odd creepiness with underdog sympathy in Dutch. \"Cherrypoppers\" starts one of the show\u0027s most gratifying running elements: Dutch and Claudette hunting a serial killer, the mystery of which spans several episodes and builds to a stirring climax face-to-face in the interrogation room. Classics include a serial killer who hunts prostitutes and one Dutch dubs \"the cuddler rapist\". The show\u0027s villains are nasty but 3 dimensional. Explored, real, but not sympathetic and free of false political correctness. A Todd Solontz film this is not.\n\nThe multi-episode story arcs are masterfully constructed, coming together and paying off in ways that most HBO and other serial series only promise too. This includes a season one real estate deal that, brilliantly, explodes in neighborhood riots, a 2 seasons-spanning scam to rip off the Armenian money train, the battle to take down crooked community activist Antwon Mitchell (Anthony Anderson, chilling in a rare dramatic role) and the jail-house-style oral rape of a major character and the resulting psychological aftermath that is as bold and daring as it is stomach-churning.\n\nAside from and a lingering camera shot telling us something is up, we aren\u0027t offered much of an emotional attachment to these characters (the way you might find in the immaculate genre series \"Boomtown\"). They are defined by whatever perilous situation finds them. There is enough to keep me riveted to the unfolding story, but the show lacks an emotional core that would rile up even more excitement in me. \"The Shield\" is more of an intellectual and fiercely visceral experience.\n\nThe show-runners\u0027 inability to write female characters also hurts it a tad, leaving the capable Dent to be left around for little more than as an accessory to Vic. It isn\u0027t until Glenn Close shows up in season 4 that we see a character that is written to be played as balls-out as the guys, and Close (as terrific as you\u0027d expect) bits into every inch of it. The show also suffers, unfairly, by the mere existence of \"24\", which has raised the bar for television suspense.\n\nThe writing, crisp direction and flawless ensemble all contribute to a show with a flawless pedigree. \"The Shield\" is the best cop show on TV. Better than \"NYPD Blue\", \"The Wire\", or \"Law \u0026 Order\" - all of which seem static and stale in comparison. It is the most honest, creative, riveting and respectful treatment of the genre in my lifetime. Not to mention its sly sense of humor. This show is a stylishly produced, breathless, visceral thrill ride through the worst kind of depravity this species can produce. A mystery, a thriller, a cop show - all in one. Mackey is our unlikely anti-hero against it, a pit-bull off its leash, cathartically satisfying our blood-lust. It\u0027s an ugly job but somebody has to do it and Mackey is the hero we deserve.\n\nI\u0027m not a fan of pushing the envelop for the sake of it, just to get attention. But that is a discussion for a show that isn\u0027t as good as \"The Shield\", which after 4 years is still consistently one of the best dramas on TV.\n\n* * * * ½ / 5" }
