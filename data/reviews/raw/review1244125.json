Right after the Cycle 5 reunion aired a commercial for Cycle 6 appeared. And if you download an application for a America\u0027s Next Top Model it says Cycle 7 and I really cant wait!!!!!!! And Tyra Banks will still be hosting the shows, even though she has retired from modeling she is stll a hugh part of the show. Being the creator/executive producer she will still go on. I really want this show to go on. This show is really great and hopefully there will be at least be 5 more seasons till the show ends because I don\u0027t think that this show should end any time soon !!!!!!! \n\nThank God that Nicole Won!!!" }
