Light entertainment, nothing to think about, just sit back watch the stars of Hollywood\u0027s Golden Age and enjoy. Any movie with Dennis Morgan AND Jack Carson has to be good, and Doris Day pretties up the whole thing. Lots of cameos by Hollywood\u0027s best and lots of talent. I recommend this movie when you\u0027re tired and stressed and just want a good movie to relax to. The other great thing about this movie is you never know who will show up. Gary Cooper and Dennis Morgan sitting at a drug store counter, Coop sipping Coke, Dennis prattling on and Coop just saying \"Yup.\" Just goes to show you don\u0027t need to say a lot, especially a lot of \"F\" words to show your talent. Nobody in Hollywood today comes up to these stars in terms of talent and class.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
