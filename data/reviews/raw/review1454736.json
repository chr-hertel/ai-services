Very well done!", "reviewBody": "Go see this movie. Some people wonder if it\u0027s serious or supposed to be funny, and I\u0027d say the acting was dead serious but you just can\u0027t take it seriously when you watch it. Everyone in the theater was laughing the whole time, and was yelling out loud and wincing at some parts. There is blood and gore and amazing suspense mixed with great satirical dialog.\n\nIf you want a movie that develops a plot where there\u0027s a thick mystery or sweet love story or fantastical beasts, don\u0027t see this movie. If you want to be 100% completely entertained for an hour and a half, SEE THIS MOVIE!! The audience was literally cheering and clapping when it finished.\n\nIt\u0027s been mentioned that this may be more of a \"man\" movie. I COMPLETELY disagree. The ratings on this site are almost exactly the same for guys and girls (you can see this by rating it, then you will be taken to a page that shows you these statistics.) You know all those B-movies like attack of the killer something... well, think of snakes on a plane as a b-movie that actually turned out well.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
