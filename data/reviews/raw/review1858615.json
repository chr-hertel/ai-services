This makes me wonder, does this lower the bar for the box office expectations of the new Incredible Hulk movie, coming out in 2008. But first, I recommend you see this Hulk, in a different universe and starring Eric Bana, so you can compare the two. This Hulk is actually very good and was better than I had expected. But did its flaws really weigh it down?\n\nIf you\u0027ve read the comic book series, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, you know the story - otherwise, I can\u0027t say much more. But it seems to play the typical mutation in comics, caused by a gamma ray experiment. The creation is the \"Incredible Hulk\" - a giant, green, muscle-bound creation of pure surprise and unexpectedness. As you\u0027ve probably heard before, you won\u0027t like him when he\u0027s angry. I can\u0027t guarantee you\u0027ll like the movie either (a lot of people didn\u0027t) but the CGI animators were at the top of their game making this movie. And director Ang Lee won\u0027t be recognized for this film a lot in regards to his own work, but his own touch is clearly in the film, and you know what that means: greatness.\n\nSo, if you\u0027re checking out the new Hulk movie, try to at least rent this movie first. There\u0027s no saying you\u0027ll be glad you did, as many people didn\u0027t see that. But in my opinion it was a good movie, and worthy of a big old HULK-SMASH!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
