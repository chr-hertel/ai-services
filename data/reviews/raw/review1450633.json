Well, I went to see this with some friends, and we found it to be extremely unexciting and uninspiring. This updated version features basically the same plot, this time though it\u0027s set in Antonio Bay, Oregon, rather than Antonio Bay, California. There is an eerie thick fog that begins rolling into town on the 100th anniversary of the town\u0027s founding, and, as the priest said, the ghosts of mariners who want revenge come ravaging through the town, picking off the descendants of the town\u0027s founding fathers who were responsible for their horrible deaths.\n\nTwo major television stars, Tom Welling (\"Smallville\") and Maggie Grace (\"Lost) star as our main leads, and give lackluster performances. Welling plays the clichéd \"ex-boyfriend\" and Grace is the innocent girl (who also likes to walk around in her underwear) who can see all of the horrible things that are happening. On rare occasions, some horror movies can work with so many clichés, but this one didn\u0027t at all. Selma Blair is the best performer of the whole film (playing the radio host Stevie), she alone is the best in the movie. Too bad she was involved with this, but I guess she improved it slightly. The fog this time around is obviously CGI, so it\u0027s everywhere, slithering under doors, through car vents, etc. I think real fog would\u0027ve been much better, but with the technology, I expected CGI. \n\nThe kills in this movie weren\u0027t scary at all when they tried to be, in fact they were just boring and unoriginal, example being the scene on the boat with the guy and those two promiscuous girls. Not once was I slightly spooked at all, I was just bored. And when the ending came around, I was so confused I wanted to yell at the screen. The film\u0027s conclusion was abrupt, semi-confusing, and just completely unneeded. The credits rolled, and I didn\u0027t feel like that had been the end of the movie at all. It just didn\u0027t fit.\n\nUnfortunately, the entire film just \"didn\u0027t fit\". It was boring, unoriginal, and was just an all around unfaithful and uninspired remake. This is the kind of horror movie you go see on Halloween with some friends without any intentions of seeing a good movie, because this one really wasn\u0027t. Some CGI fog and a lackluster ending don\u0027t make a good movie. A failed effort that could have been halfway decent. 3/10.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
