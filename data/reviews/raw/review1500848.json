Rest of the cast is attractive smart \u0026 quick. Though I think the writing goes for the obvious occasionally, it has a heart beneath the cleverness \u0026 pokes fun at itself too.\n\nI am back to Prison Break for the new season. BUT soon as I can, I\u0027ll be checking in on these kids.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
