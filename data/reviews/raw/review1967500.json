But considering this is his first leading role, he does well enough. This was well before my time and I had never heard his name before so it was nice to stumble upon someone considered quite the heartthrob in his day. It\u0027s interesting that he ended up married to Gail Russell, who I had heard of, but apparently the marriage didn\u0027t last long (she died an early death at 36 due to alcoholism).\n\nMitchum shows good acting skills early in his career. Dorothy Maguire gives an interesting depiction of a war widow. Sure, she\u0027s not the best looking they could have cast here, but I think her \"ordinariness\" makes her character much more sympathetic and probably helped many real war widows see themselves in her character.\n\nI\u0027m not sure the tidy ending did anyone a service though. I doubt many vets with real problems and issues could tie up there loose ends so neatly, but this is Hollywood.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
