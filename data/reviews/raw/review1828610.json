I wasn\u0027t expecting too much out of this thing but got a lot less than I was hoping for. At 55-minutes you\u0027d think this thing would at least fly by but it\u0027s pretty dry and slow. The horror elements are incredibly weak as is the mystery behind the body. The humor is even worse with some racial jokes about a local hangman who keeps threatening the black servant with hanging jokes. James Dunn takes the lead and is more annoying than anything else." }
