Its not near to be a classic or a great movie, but its overall entertaining. Its like a cheesy Psycho rip-off with a \"buner psycho\". It features a very well done scene in which a naked woman is burned, looks realistic and great, but thats the only \"gross\" stuff this movie has. Its not gory at all. The story: a mentally grown man begins to burn women when his mother (who burned him when kid) dies. He is a complete psycho who have his dead mother in his house and hear voices from his mother and from other \"spirits\". Owerall, you can enjoy this movie if you do not have big expectations, i believe this movie has more \"fame\" than \"fact\" .6/10" }
