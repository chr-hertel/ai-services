There is always an earnest desperation in her attempt to get cast that is funny. This episode reveals that MT (Marlo Thomas) got all the on screen charisma genes from her dad, while her siblings apparently got none. Her brother and sister seemed to have gotten all the musical talent. Tony, being the drummer, is of course the most talented Thomas because everyone knows drummers are the most talented people. I\u0027m not saying that because I play drums. I\u0027m saying that because it is the truth. The scene near the end when Ann bumped into the priest really made me laugh. A great pay off to family affair humor threaded through out the episode." }
