( it did rather better on the Continent ). Taken on its own terms, its not too bad. Jack Shampan\u0027s production design is superb, as is John Dankworth\u0027s music, there are a couple of decent performances ( Clive Revill, Harry Andrews, and a wonderfully camp turn from Dirk Bogarde ) and some good moments such as Modesty finding herself trapped in an op art cell. But as an adaptation of Peter O\u0027Donnell and Jim Holdaway\u0027s comic-strip, its a non-starter. Monica Vitti fails to project warmth and charm as Modesty, while Terence Stamp sounds like Michael Caine on an off-day. The scene where they sing a romantic duet whilst under fire is just painful. Losey was clearly not the right director for this project. Fox made a rather more successful \u0027girl power\u0027 Bond thriller a year later - \u0027Fathom\u0027, starring Raquel Welch.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
