One day a woman shows up claiming that Warren is the father of her son. Warren reacts violently.\n\n10 years later Rita is a determined single mother trying to make her life better, but she is still just a waitress, and her son has cystic fibrosis, which doesn\u0027t exactly help him make friends. Matt meets a new friend Bret who wants Matt to do his homework for him. Bret also breaks into parking meters and uses drugs supplied by his friend DiDonna.\n\nCallie Thomas does a capable job as Rita, making us like this character who just wants a better life for herself and her son, and can\u0027t seem to get a break despite a lot of determination. The real bright spot in this movie, though, is Eileen Galindo, as an obnoxious applicant for one of the jobs Rita wants. The boys do good jobs in their roles, and Cassandra Morris somehow makes DiDonna seem like a good kid.\n\nIt\u0027s not a classic, but this is a pleasant enough and inspiring movie." }
