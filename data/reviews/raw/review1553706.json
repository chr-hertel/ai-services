With Clary being a Holocaust survivor. However, it is also true that Verner Klemperer son of famous conductor Otto Klemperer, as well as, Leon Askin ( General Burkhalter ) and Howard Caine (Major Hochstetter ) were also Jewish. This helped CBS give the green light to go ahead with the series. A lot of the guest stars playing Nazi\u0027s were Jewish as well. James B. Sikking, Michael Fox \u0026 Harold J. Stone to name a few. Execs figured if some of the main stars who were playing German officers were Jewish and they were OK with it then, hopefully, so would be the public. They were right!" }
