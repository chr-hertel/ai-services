It is simply brilliant and entertaining to see how all the story-lines are connected. All of the fun characters make all of the story-lines equally great and entertaining. The movie is great from start till finish and never weakens a bit. The movie has a high pace and the light fun atmosphere make this movie a pleasure to watch, as does the brilliant British humor. The story might become a bit too complex and hard to follow at times but with a clear head you should be able to see and appreciate the brilliance of it all.\n\nHollywood can learn something from movies like this.\n\nIt really is a movie that you\u0027ll enjoy watching over and over again because of its high entertainment value. It certainly is a movie I want to see again. Surprisingly I even think that this might be one of my favorite movies now.\n\nHow many times have I said the word brilliant now? Well, let me say it one more time because this movie truly is; Brilliant!\n\n10/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
