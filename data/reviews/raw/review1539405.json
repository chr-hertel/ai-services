BEST ending ever.......", "reviewBody": "I\u0027m making this comment in answer to the summary above where the poster states he didn\u0027t like the ending.. OK, everyone to their own, but personally I thought QL had the best ending of any show I\u0027ve ever seen.\n\nThere was just so much happening you\u0027ve got to pay attention, but it\u0027s certainly worth it...\n\nWhen Shtopaw leaps... wow what a twist, I got totally blindsided by that, I just did not see it coming. Great stuff.\n\nAlso pay attention to the end credits.. that pic isn\u0027t a stock frame, Scott and Dean stood for those 30 sec and smiled to us.. as if to say..\u0027Goodbye, and thanks for watching. It was a really nice touch and I know I appreciated it.\n\n(Best Cartman voice) I love those guys.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
