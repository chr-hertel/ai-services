They get burnt out by the anti-American sentiment in Amsterdam and decide to go to Slovakia; where they are told \u0027the best woman are\". But things are not what they seem.\n\nThis movie is a lot like \u0027Urban Legend\u0027 meets \u0027Hellraiser\u0027 with lots of gruesome blood and guts. It is not really that scary and there is not very much that is unique about it. I am a bit surprised that Quentin Tarantino would put his name on this film. There is nothing all that clever about the plot or story.\n\nIn its defense, there are a lot intense gruesome scenes; if you like that sort of thing. It is not for everyone. The cinematography was really good and it has a lot of naked girls running around.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
