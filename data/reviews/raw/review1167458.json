There is no way you can make a movie and not cut 80% of Homer tale. If you didn\u0027t the movie would be days long. But you don\u0027t have to change things around to make it shorter. This movie makes the war weeks (or less) long where it took 10 years, with all kinds of twists. Achilles doesn\u0027t ride in the horse (but I guess you can\u0027t kill Pitt off before the end). No reference to Odessus\u0027s 10 years to get home (yes it\u0027s another story, but a reference was expected). Cutting the gods completely out of the story was OK, yet I liked the story where they are involved. They could have shown Achilles being dipped in the river Styx except for his heal to explain his dying. But I\u0027ll take a \"This is how it really happened\" take on the movie. It works OK.\n\nAs for an action movie it\u0027s OK. I\u0027m really getting sick of scenes that you know are CGI just because there is too much stuff (e.g. 1000 ships). The battle scenes are pretty good. It\u0027s no Gladiator though.\n\nThe acting was all over the place. This is Pitt\u0027s worst yet. I think this is due more to the director than to Pitt himself (e.g. See 12 Monkeys). Eric Bana does a great Hector and Bloom turns in a pretty wimpy Paris. Peter O\u0027Toole seemed he like should retire. He walked through the movie like he wanted to be somewhere else. Although I never would have guessed I\u0027d see a movie with a Brad Pitt and Peter O\u0027Toole scene.\n\nOn the whole it was a fun watch. 6/10 (+6 for the action -4 for Pitts acting). Those thought provoking stares into the sunset were really bad.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
