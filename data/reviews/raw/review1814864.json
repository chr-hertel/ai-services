Tense.", "reviewBody": "*exhales* I just finished this film and it blew my mind.\n\nI bought this movie on the strength of the directing of Paprika and I had no idea what this movie was about. I can come up with only one word: Intense.\n\nThe basic plot of Perfect Blue is the main character, Mima, is a successful pop singer who chooses to leave her group and become an actress. But soon after discovering a website that tracks her every move in detail followed by landing a role in a violent television drama, strange things begin to happen all around her. She becomes paranoid and hallucinates about an alternate self who is still a pop singer. Soon reality and dreams merge all leading to a very thrilling finale.\n\nI cannot describe this movie in my words but it is the best movie I\u0027ve seen in a good long time. I very much recommend it to all who can handle scenes of explicit violence and disturbing images.\n\n10/10. A fantastic psychological drama.\n\nAs a side note, the upbeat opening song is a real contrast to the movie itself. I catch myself humming it and I can\u0027t help but laugh.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
