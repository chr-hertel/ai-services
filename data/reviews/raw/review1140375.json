I\u0027ve heard a lot about it and was wanting to see it! The movie was about a story that supposedly happened around WWII. I thought the acting was good, the story was good, and the plot was really one to follow! Angelina Jolie only had a couple scenes in this one. You would think she would\u0027ve had a bigger part in it because she was billed up along with co-stars Paltrow and Jude Law. Paltrow played a newspaper who re-kindles a relationship with Law. That kind of added a hint of romance to this one! I like the cameos by Sir Laurence Olivier! I think this movie is a good one to watch and to keep in your collection!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
