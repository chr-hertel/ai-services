It\u0027s not. You should however go into it thinking it\u0027s going to be an action flick with Samuel Jackson, and some cheesy lines. I mean people who don\u0027t like this movie are either immature, or just don\u0027t like good movies. I agree with jawschelch there is nothing wrong with this movie at all. Give it a shot, I did and I am not disappointed. Not a 10/10, or a 9/10, but if you don\u0027t think this is at least a 5/10 pull your head out of your a@# and get a life. I just think that people lately don\u0027t have good taste in movies and need to open up a little.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
