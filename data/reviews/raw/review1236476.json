C.S Lewis\u0027 genius was reduced to a barney movie. Instead of all the expensive cheesy effects, green screen and bad animation they should have paid for a better director and script. All the meaningful moments were glossed over and none of the characters were believable. The fight/ action scenes were like a bad video game, none of it seemed important. In the book you see the characters evolve and you believe these kids when they transform over time into kings and queens, fighting minitars and such. Leave it to Disney to not have faith in the kids in the audience and us and dumb everything down. When did our society completely loose faith in the intelligence and depth of our kids? Seeing children\u0027s movies like these makes me want to vomit because of the trash we are feeding our kids minds. What happened to the jungle books, lord of the flies, the Narnias, the wrinkle in times, and lord of the rings Etc.? Stories and productions meant for kids but not dumbed down for 2 year olds. The book is so incredibly better than this film; it\u0027s embarrassing. Lord of the Rings hit it on the nail, this missed it by a football field. to bad Warner Bros didn\u0027t do it. the director should be shot and the mouse should be hanged. i was very much hoping this would be great and unfortunately it was a huge disappointment. this was more of a Disney TV movie of the week instead of a major motion picture. i wanted an Oscar movie i got a movie that wouldn\u0027t even get nominated for an emmy.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
