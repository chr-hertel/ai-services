Such noteworthy performances by all. This movie that was perfectly filmed in black and white made me feel several different emotions. Sadness for both Ian and his wife, anger at Ian for some choices he made, a need to pop a Prozac at the beginning, middle \u0026 end of the film :-), such utter feelings of hopelessness poured from the TV screen. When Ian sang, he put all his emotional and physical being into each song, it is no wonder of the outcome. I felt such sadness for Debbie...helplessness. I hope her and her child are doing well today. I think Ian needed to be committed for help with what really seemed to be a very serious mental illness. Hopefully, this movie will teach some up and coming musicians that being happy is more important than fame and fortune.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
