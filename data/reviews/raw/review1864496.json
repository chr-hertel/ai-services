Years ago, when I first saw this film in a reduced and very badly put together restoration from the 80s (with the Razzie-nominated Giorgio Moroder score!), I thought it was one of the worst silent pictures I had ever seen. Today (ironically in the then-distant 21st century when the film is supposed to be set) we at last have an adequate reconstruction, with a cleaned up negative, explanations of missing scenes and the original Gottfried Huppertz score, and we can see Metropolis for the masterpiece it is.\n\nThe first thing that hits you when watching Metropolis is the powerful sense of rhythm, with an attention grabbing montage of industrial machinery. From here on the dynamic, kinetic flow of images is continuous  creating an exciting and extreme form of visual storytelling comparable to the work Eisenstein and Abel Gance. In his previous few films you can see Lang trying to perfect the rhythm and structure of the whole and here he finally manages it. The drama is even structured and labelled like a work of classical music. The \"prelude\" establishes themes and characters and is full of impressive and grandiose imagery, yet never gets too frantic in pace. The \"intermezzo\" begins slowly before building up to the frenzy of the erotic dance/nightmare sequence. Finally, the \"furioso\" section is a tour-de-force of non-stop action. Thanks to the Nibelungen films, Lang had learned by this point to direct crowds and action convincingly.\n\nThe other strand in Lang\u0027s work that reached maturity with Metropolis was his architect\u0027s approach to shots and sets. He\u0027d been using geometric patterns and massive interiors since the early 20s, but now you can tell he knows exactly what he\u0027s doing. One of the \"rules\" of cinema is the so-called line of action, which means you are supposed to keep the camera on one side only of two opposing actors, so that one is always screen-left and the other always screen-right. Lang completely ignores this rule, freely placing his camera at whichever angle he deems necessary. This technique would become harder for Lang when he moved to Hollywood, where sets were like rooms in a doll\u0027s house with three sides only. Here however, every set is a genuine space with four walls, and Lang shows these off to achieve a feeling of reality. This use of space is not just some aesthetic gimmick  it is really used to enhance the film experience. Take for example the scene in which Rotwang captures Maria in the catacombs. Lang cannot exploit fear of the unknown because we, the audience, already know what is happening. Instead, he creates a real sense of enclosure and entrapment with his 360-degree coverage of the cave.\n\nThe science-fiction setting of Metropolis makes acceptable the over-the-top visual effects of German expressionist cinema (such as double-exposures and animated titles) and, fortunately Lang knew where to draw the line on these flashy techniques. The unreality of the genre also allows for more stylised acting, and the Germans really were the masters of ham. Rudolph Klein-Rogge makes a typically crazed villain. Brigitte Helm also does a good job in several contrasting roles.\n\nSo long as you can ignore the occasionally daft ideas of screenwriter Thea von Harbou, Metropolis in its current restored version is Fritz Lang\u0027s best film. He would make plenty of other classics, and he would always have some level of quality even in the worst of his Hollywood potboilers, but this is his highest peak.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
