Night is losing it.", "reviewBody": "M. Night is losing it, as far as making movies goes. I was really impressed with Sixth Sense, so as with most his fans. His movies are slowing degrading in his story lines. I think he is running out of \u0027material\u0027.\n\nThe behind the scenes, DVD, show all that was involved in making \"The Village\". I was particularly interested in how much work and training the Joquen Pheonix did to prepare for his role. I think his total amount of dialoge was about 2 minutes for the whole movie.\n\nAt the last check, the movie has grossed well under the approximate budget.\n\nI will certainly think twice before I spent any more money on his movies.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
