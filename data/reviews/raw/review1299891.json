I did not feel you connected at all with cast so when they died, I was not bothered at all. The main character was so bad I thought gosh I hope it\u0027s her turn next! \n\nThey gave us more gore but forgot to give us a decent storyline. In fact was there a story line, nope. Sigh :0( \n\nThe first final made you think, the second you wanted them to beat death. The third you wanted them to loose, and quickly ... looks like I didn\u0027t like it!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
