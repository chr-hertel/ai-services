If you need a laugh, this is the flick for you. Go see this movie now, you won\u0027t regret it.\n\nMr. Smith stays true to the characters we know and love(and if you don\u0027t know and love them... you will). He also adds a few characters to the fold and they are a pleasant surprise who manage to shine and fit in with the\"Clerks\" veterans.\n\nI know this was a vague review, but I hate giving away details(hate to spoil even the littlest of jokes).", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
