Here, in 1931, we see him in the early part of his acting renaissance in the very early era of \"talkies\" and in the character role that he would make his own until his death in 1948 after finishing his last performance in Little Women which released in 1949.\n\nThis engaging play is about an elderly British aristocrat who locates his illegitimate children and introduces himself to them, having brought them to his manor in England.\n\nMarion Davies plays his daughter-by-error and it\u0027s a tour de force for her. She is all at once endearing, impatient, shallow, enchanting, wise and compassionate while creating an indelible and beguiling character that remains well ensconced in the memory.\n\nThe 26 year old Ray Milland appears here in a small but prominent role having already appeared in seven other pictures then only in films for a bit more than two years.\n\nThe film should be enjoyed as a representative of 1931 Hollywood factory production of course and as such is not flawless. However, it\u0027s a charming pleasure from first scene to the last.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
