It started out well, with lots of suspense, horror and emotion, but just didn\u0027t end the way it should have. The movie was too long and could easily have been cut down to a shorter time if a handful of unnecessary scenes had been deleted. The action was great and I loved all of the special effects, along with the plot. Radha Mitchell is wonderful, as always, and even though Sean Bean didn\u0027t quite pull off the American accent he played his part well. The ending ruined the entire movie for me. I hate artistic endings almost as much as I hate unclear endings, and this was both. If this movie had maintained the same slick pace it started off with, been about twenty minutes shorter, and had a more solid ending, I would have loved it. As it is I don\u0027t care to see it again, and I wouldn\u0027t recommend it to anyone except for maybe as a rental later in the year.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
