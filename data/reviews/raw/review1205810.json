Thank you for wasting 2 hours and 5 minutes of my life. I should have learnt my lesson.\n\nThere was too much crying and not enough action, at times i wanted to shout \"get the hell on with it!\" I think the way the director constructs his films is quite unique and commendable (with the actors doing much improvisation) but COME ON! make some happier films because one more like that and i just might jump off a cliff.\n\nUnless your into illegal abortion in the 1950\u0027s and a lot of crying and disappointment, give this one a miss.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
