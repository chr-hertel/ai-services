It had action and hilarious scenes topped off with good music.\n\nI expected another superhero movie where the normal person turns into a superhero and kills a bad guy. Iron Man had incredible story development with some of the best casting i have seen in a long time. It has scenes that had me laughing out loud in the cinema. Luckily the funny bits don\u0027t ruin the dramatic and intense scenes.\n\nRobert Downey JR was born to play Iron Man. In fact he is Iron Man. His attitude matches this completely. It was the best casting i have seen in years.\n\nThe CGI was awesome. It actually looked like a real man flying through the air. Unlike the unrealistic super flexible Spider-man swinging through the air. Loved the detail on the suit and surrounding environments.\n\nThe Iron Man suit was great. Felt like a separate character with it malfunctioning on our main character. We get hilarious results. \n\nI can already tell that this is the new popular superhero. Like Spider-Man was but only better. It already has a sequel on the way and i hope that is as solid as this was.\n\nIt is one of the best superhero movies out there so it is definitely worth seeing. Good job Jon Favreau and all involved.\n\n9/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
