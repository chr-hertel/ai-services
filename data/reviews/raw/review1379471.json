Gísli Halldórsson gives a great performance as always and really gives the movie a lot.\n\nIt is a very beautiful film where the main contrast is not on spoken word but on what the eye sees and that is what makes this movie work not only in Iceland but worldwide. There is not word spoken for the first 20 minutes of the films and by then the viewer doesn\u0027t really care if the film is in Icelandic or in English or what ever other language.\n\nThe movie clearly shows that you don\u0027t need to be 20 years old to be in love and how some people are simply children of nature\n\nOne of the best films i have seen. 10/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
