She meets a man (Robert Taylor) who has been following her around a casino. He finally gets the nerve to talk to her and blurt out I LOVE YOU. She is, of course, repulsed. By chance he runs into a man (George Sanders) desperate to get a note to a woman. When Taylor hears who it is (Shearer) he offers to pass the note. Silly on a certain level, the the 3 stars are so good you forget the obvious machinations of the script and just watch 3 pros at work.\n\nSanders still loves Shearer who might love Sanders but Taylor loves Shearer as she is interested. Forget the plot Taylor is a sing writer with Frank McHugh and Shearer is guarded over by maid Elizabeth Patterson. Lots of fun with many funny lines.\n\nFor some reason this was a huge bomb when released in 1942 and it ended Norma Shearer\u0027s 22-year film career. It\u0027s not even a bad movie! She looks great and gives a lively and funny performance. Taylor is also in top form.\n\nCertainly worth a look" }
