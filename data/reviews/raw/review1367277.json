It\u0027s so lovingly done. If the final scene (and Mancini\u0027s hauntingly evocative theme music) does not rend your heart then check your pulse to see if you\u0027re really alive. A worthy coda to a life of fine film-making by Da Sica.\n\nI\u0027ve always been a huge Mancini fan but the song (so aptly named \"Loss of Love\") he wrote for this film is my personal favorite. I read that he often played it in concert -- except to the one I attended at the Hollywood Bowl, shortly before he died. His daughter Monica recorded a vocal version with lyrics that were better left unwritten.\n\nApparently, until just recently, this film has been largely unavailable in the U.S. but now you can rent it from Netflix." }
