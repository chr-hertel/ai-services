In particular, the bone-shaking noises the machines communicate with are highly unsettling.\n\nThe plot follows the H.G. Wells novel somewhat closer than the 1950s movie, for what that\u0027s worth. The tripod war machines are the most noticeable example. There is at least one touch you won\u0027t appreciate at all unless you\u0027ve read the novel: the aliens\u0027 interest in a bicycle wheel in one scene is a nod to Wells\u0027 improbable conceit that the Martians (for that\u0027s who they were in the novel and the George Pal movie) had never invented the wheel! - their machines ran on a complicated system of sliding arms and cables.\n\nDakota Fanning, who plays the little kid with her emotional problems and trendy coping devices (\"This is your space. You are safe inside it.\") is the best thing in the movie, by far. She gives a professional, nuanced, performance. But Tim Robbins delivers the best line in the movie: \"Occupations always fail.\" \n\nWhat with all the ghastly bad publicity about him lately, it\u0027s a little tricky at the beginning seeing Tom Cruise and not thinking, \"That\u0027s Tom Cruise. He\u0027s insane.\" But you get used to it after a bit.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
