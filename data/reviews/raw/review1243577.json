This is from one of Jacksons B horrors called Dead Alive. I just thought it was awesome to see it there. Other wise pretty kick ass movie, lots of action although it was about 40 min too long. I don\u0027t know where he could have cut it but if it was just a little bit shorter it might have been easier to sit through. I don\u0027t have problems with three hour movies but i think some of the scenes between Ann and Kong were a little drawn out. If three hour films are making a comeback then maybe movie time intermissions should make a comeback too.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
