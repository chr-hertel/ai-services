Here we have one woman, Kate Holbrook (Tina Fey), who cannot get pregnant and then enlists another woman, Angie Ostrowiski (Amy Poehler) as her surrogate, or in the more contemporary sense, as her BABY MAMA. Angie leaves her dope of a common-law partner and moves in with Kate and the two go from cat fighting to slumber parties in no time. They\u0027re having babies; they\u0027re talking boys; they\u0027re singing along to Cyndi Lauper\u0027s \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\" in the living room. The estrogen practically slinks off the screen in stilettos. If only this expectant comedy didn\u0027t deliver such expected results. \n\nThe female bonding originates with Fey \u0026 Poehler\u0027s offscreen friendship and makes for some fabulous chemistry and spontaneous hilarity but it never successfully hides the gaping story holes. Having paid an exorbitant amount of money to a firm that screens its surrogates thoroughly should have essentially eliminated Angie as an option, as she has no functional understanding of what it means to take good care of herself. Before long, perhaps to intentionally rattle us from the unoriginal unfolding of the odd couple one would ordinarily expect, Angie\u0027s intentions come into question in such a manner that it becomes practically impossible to continue letting the good times just go on. Good clean fun is replaced by awkward angst.\n\nThis contemporary comedy draws our attention to the business of babies. It does so however in such a hackneyed fashion that if it weren\u0027t for the talented mama\u0027s at the forefront of it all, it would be little more than a painful delivery.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
