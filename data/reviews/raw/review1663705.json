To sum it up I was glad that I saw the American version (The Departed) first a while back ago and although it was very good , one can not deny that this was indeed the true master. Infernal Affairs is proof that to find increasingly good films we are all looking abroad to places like Hong Kong and Japan. This movie was a cleverly constructed piece of art with no room for silly nonsense and a buddy cop feel to it. The 2 main lead characters not to mention the main gangster were all out-standing. The acting was truly superb and flawless, the film had a certain attitude of its own which made it great! although I am aware that it went on to spawn two more sequels I will definitely make an effort to check it out. Too basically conclude , Infernal Affairs is how to make a good text book thriller with no time wasting and silly sub-plots running about and because of that time will just fly by and it will want you leaving more. Make sure that this movie is on your \u0027100 movies to watch before I die\u0027list.\n\nINFERNAL AFFAIRS : 8.9 OUT 10\n\nFOR NOW THIS IS THE SHADOWMAN WISHING YOU GOOD LUCK AND GOOD NITE !", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
