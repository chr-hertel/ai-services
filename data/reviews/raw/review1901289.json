But that wont happen,because you would rather try to question the strangeness of movie.Well,its quite interesting to know what makes Lynch,a director different from others in Hollywood?? Anyone who has followed Lynch\u0027s work regularly can answer it and few of those comments are like ambiguous,genius,stupid,strange and so on. Even the critics or movie connoisseur fails to explain the weirdness behind his stories. So its only Mr.lynch,who know what he is presenting in front his audience.May be he wants to bring his nightmare live on screen or he just likes to fool around his viewers,as after dedicating 100-120 minutes they don\u0027t get anything.....at least in terms of story!!!\n\nBut then those who hates David Lynch\u0027s films will be most satisfied by BLUE VELVET,because it is least ambiguous among others.Its much better than Mullholland Dr. and Lost Highway because it don\u0027t let its viewer gets diverted in between.....\n\nStory basically deals with two teenagers who in their excitement get involved in the mystery surrounding the night club singer Isabella. Well whatever be the storyline but the matter is presented in a very stunning manner which is quite appreciable.\n\nNo wonder its among the best of David Lynch\u0027s movie and very nearly a masterpiece.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
