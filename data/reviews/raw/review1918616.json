Gene Hackman plays an admiral willing to sacrifice his career to rescue Wilson, but all does not go as planned. Like BAT*21 before it (also starring Hackman, but in the shot-down role), LINES makes a concerted effort to show us one man trying to survive in an extremely hostile landscape, during a war to boot. We all saw the Serbs gunning down ethnic Albanians on TV and read about their atrocities. This film brings that all-too-recent war back to life. The special effects are absolutely eye-popping, although how Wilson survives hundreds of people shooting at him is a bit much to take. A great ending, similar to that of BAT*21. See both films to compare and contrast, especially to witness how far special effects have come in a few short years.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
