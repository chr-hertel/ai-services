I think so.\n\nFilmed before the killings, (most of it anyway) but released after, it made you wonder why the signs weren\u0027t noticed earlier.\n\nCharlie preaches the typical hippie shtick and his wide-eyed, spacey followers talk about love and knives in the same thought. If there was ever a graphic anti-hallucinogenic drug ad, this was it.\n\nThis needs a new DVD release with updates and special additions. Someone get on it. It\u0027s worth it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
