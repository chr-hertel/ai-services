From beginning to end you will be holding your breath. This Movie is a Masterpiece. If you do not go to see this movie you will be miss something unbelievable. I too was skeptical with all the hype, but everything from the stunts, to the acting, to the messages of morality went straight to my heart. I want to see this again!!!!! In Conclusion this has brought my faith in Hollywood back. For the last few years it has been going down hill, but this movie makes me wanna jump around and scream for more. The Dark Knight is breathtaking. This movie is a work of Genius, I can not wait to see it again, in fact....Im going to go back to the movies right now and watch it again!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
