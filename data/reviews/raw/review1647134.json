Martin is singer Bob Gregory, who is about to be deported. We never get the full story, except his parents never applied for citizenship. Presumably he was born elsewhere but raised in the U.S. On his way to the boat to leave the country, his cab collides with the one carrying gorgeous Patricia O\u0027Malley (Hayworth) who is on her way to the boat, too, so she can marry a rich man (Mowbray). They both miss the boat, and Bob ends up not only staying with Patricia\u0027s family but falling in love with her as well.\n\nThe film is filled with music and some great singing by Martin, who by the time I was a child, wasn\u0027t doing this type of singing any longer. He had a fantastic tenor voice. Rita\u0027s hair looks black here but she\u0027s no less beautiful. She only has one dance, but it\u0027s basically hip movement - we don\u0027t get to see much else. She and Martin make a handsome team and give relaxed performances.\n\n\"Music in My Heart\" is probably a cut above a B, considering the cast. Since Cohn was grooming Rita for stardom, he surrounded her with good talent. Not that she needed anyone else around her - she always glittered like gold.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
