And you can enjoy it even when you are over 40. I, and the people next to me (many of them real adults!), laughed all through the movie. There was even some applause at the end (and this was not Caracas, Venezuela, but Boulder, Colorado). It is laughter that (I think) you do not have to be ashamed of: You do not laugh because people are denigrated or humiliated (as in so many other movies, which, in my brain, leave a bad aftertaste), but because, well, because things are simply funny.\n\nBy the way, I do not think that the R rating is justified. The \"sexual content\" was basically limited to the f-word, and maybe someone who does not know what cocaine is would be slightly surprised. But the movie is not sleazy, and the drug use (which does not play a big role anyway) is not glorified, neither in the positive nor in the negative sense. But beware, I am German, and German sensitivities are slightly different from the Americans\u0027.\n\nI don\u0027t want to tell you anything about the story or the characters, as the less you know, the more you discover for yourself and the more fun you\u0027ll have. Go, take your spouse along, and, if the f-word does not shock you (or your kid--well, your kid probably less than you anyway), take your 13- or 14-year-old along too. A real feel-good movie!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
