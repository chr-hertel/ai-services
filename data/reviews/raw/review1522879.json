However, when the film was made, it was a pretty good picture and his fans loved it. Nowadays, you might be bored by the overly simple plot, but for 1911 it was actually pretty good in this regard also--with some slapstick humor and an \"evil stepmother\" theme that was pretty popular in its day.\n\nMr. Bunny (he\u0027s not a rabbit--that\u0027s his real name) is a rich widower who has an obnoxious little daughter who he dotes over continually. However, he is advised my his aunt that the child needs more discipline in the form of a strict governess. He agrees and is sexually fixated on the nasty governess\u0027 hair--so much so that he not only ignores how mean she is but asks her to marry him! This plot line isn\u0027t very believable and when seen today, this is a bit hard to take. However, the marriage is averted when a housekeeper takes action--convincing the brat to cut off the nasty governess\u0027 hair while she is sleeping. Since Mr. Bunny only loved the lady for her hair, the wedding is off and the man and child live happily ever after! A strange plot, I know, but a lot of fun to watch--especially when the hair is whacked off and the old battle-axe is left with nothing to recommend her.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
