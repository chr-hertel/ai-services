But I was, for the most part disappointed. The entire mystique of the text is the relationship of Humans with their Daemons. The reason millions continued reading the next 2 books in the series was the human/daemon devotion to one another. It\u0027s the heart and soul of the entire trilogy, and it\u0027s NOT the central focal point in the movie. It\u0027s barely mentioned. The chronology is inexplicably altered in the film as well. Why can\u0027t Hollywood co-opt novels in an intelligent way? Did they learn nothing from \"Lord Of The Rings\"? Any fan of those books will tell you that Peter Jackson\u0027s adaptation was so utterly clever in it\u0027s adherence to the \u0027IT\u0027 factor of the text. Hollywood truly believes the masses are fools, mouth breathing, move-their- lips- while-they\u0027re-reading fools. They must, otherwise \u0027Compass\u0027 might have retained more than a fifth of the novels luster. If you haven\u0027t read the book, then my review is lost on you, and all I can suggest to you is to read it, or buy the audiobook on iTunes(my new favorite medium for fantasy novels such as this and the Potter books) Those who HAVE read it I\u0027m sure will agree with me once they\u0027ve seen the film. Bear fight rocked, but it was too short. Overall, it\u0027s just another NICE movie about a little kid with a grand destiny. AND without spoiling anything, The film ended about 30 pages shy of the books ending. Those not in the know have no clue what they are really missing.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
