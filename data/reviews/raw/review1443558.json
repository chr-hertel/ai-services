The books, while occasionally interesting, are clearly aimed at a very young audience, and are predictably paced. An adult can pretty much read the entire series in an afternoon.\n\nThe movie, on the other hand picks and chooses the best episodes from the book series and blends them together into a passable story. The actors playing the children are convincing. On top of it all, the movie is visually stunning, portraying a bleak, timeless landscape that is sometimes present-day and always retro in a \"Brazil\" or \"1984\"-like way.\n\nKudos to all involved with this production for taking very marginal source material and turning it into a real treat, including Jim Carey, who does his usual over-the-top performance. It\u0027s perfectly appropriate in this film and he deserves points just for enduring that obviously painful makeup job.\n\nGo rent it. You\u0027ll like it. As mentioned in other posts, a large portion of the movie may be a little advanced for your younger children. Show it to them, anyway. They\u0027ll enjoy it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
