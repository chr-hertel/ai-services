And although I think Martin Scorsese should\u0027ve gotten his Oscar for another movie than this (so the decision was right not to give him one here imho), I also think he made better movies than Departed. Then again Departed delivered and satisfied more than this!\n\nThe acting from Di Caprio is good (much better than in Gangs), although some of the scenes (or better the script) seems to let him down. Even a scene in a cinema hall, really happened (the movie is based on real characters, fyi if you didn\u0027t know already), it just didn\u0027t translate that well on screen, imho! And the real characters? I do think (and I\u0027m not the only one, as friends of mine have told me), that some actors/actresses have been miscast. The fact that I\u0027m not fully aware of all the H. Hughes stories shouldn\u0027t make a difference in my viewing pleasure, but then again they might have made this experience a bit lighter (and heavier at the same time, because of the length) for me ... Not a bad movie/biopic by any mean, but nothing I was excited about afterwards either!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
