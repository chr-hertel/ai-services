It\u0027s pretty obvious in watching this that the screenplay is junk the director doesn\u0027t know how to direct actors at all, and as a result the acting is terrible too. It brings new meaning to the word \"trite.\" There are a few scenes that look good on the screen, such as the part with the Japanese planes flying over the kids playing baseball and the like. Never mind that there probably weren\u0027t many kids playing baseball first thing in the morning on Sunday, but whatever, the image was at least striking. I\u0027ll give it that. It can\u0027t really make up for the junky love story, however.\n\nNow, why I use the word shameful. This isn\u0027t some fictional event, it was an actual event in relatively recent history (in the grand scheme of things) in which quite a few people actually died. Not only that, but it started in motion a chain of events that was very serious, resulted in a tremendous amount of sacrifice, and should be treated with at least some respect. It deserves better than a crap-o treatment by Michael Bay, the king of schlocky movies.\n\nI\u0027m hoping that in a few years people will forget that this thing was even created.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
