Various films from Psycho, Peeping Tom, The Boston Strangler, Seven and The Silence of the Lambs are discussed by directors and experts on real serial killers. They give various reasons as to why they are so popular today, although I don\u0027t agree with everything brought up. I do find it funny that the mainstream has taken so well to these \"thrillers\" while the actual \"horror\" films are still hated." }
