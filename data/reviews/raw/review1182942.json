I\u0027m not a big fan of American history, but this particular period is interesting, and The Roaring Twenties; at heart a swansong to the decade and the tradition of gangster flicks is definitely one of the better films set in the twenties. The star and director team behind 1949\u0027s masterpiece \"White Heat\" team up here for the first time and both show the flair that would go on to make White Heat what it is. Cagney\u0027s strong persona is expertly captured by Walsh\u0027s camera, and even during the film\u0027s less interesting moments; this is enough to keep it afloat. The story ties in all the classic gangster film elements including love, business, gunfights, rivalry and the male ego. The plot follows three WWI veterans; one of which becomes a lawyer, another a bootlegger and Cagney runs a Taxi firm. The latter finds a lucrative business, which involves him brewing and selling alcohol, which was illegal at the time under the prohibition act.\n\nJames Cagney is definitely the star of the film, but bubbling just beneath him is an excellent Humphrey Bogart. Cagney\u0027s Angels With Dirty Faces co-star turns in another excellent support turn here, which just hints at the acclaim he would go on to achieve. It\u0027s always interesting to see an actor before they really hit the big time, and Bogart\u0027s performance is one of the main attractions here. One of the things I loved about the way that the story is executed are the news style bulletins that pop up every now and again to inform the audience of the wider plot developments. These give the film a very retro sort of feel, which also help it in it\u0027s bid to remind viewers of the era (at the time of release) that had just gone by. In many ways, this film was ahead of it\u0027s time and this is shown by the fact that many modern films, most notably Goodfellas, work from the same plot structure and many of the same ideas. In short, almost every aspect of the film works and the end result is a gangster flick that hasn\u0027t been treat badly by the test of time. At times, the plot dwindles a bit and there\u0027s a few too many singing scenes; but on the whole, if you like gangster flicks and classic films, you\u0027ll like this.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
