Kyle maclachlan plays jeffrey,a student who returns to the village to see his sick dad,he then happens to fins an ear in the grass and reports it,but his curiosity gets the better of him and with some help from the sheriffs daughter he decides to find things out for himself and along the way meets dorothy,played brilliantly by isabella rossellini,who is a slave to the excellent frank,played by dennis hopper who has kidnapped her son,events unravel as fear and darkness become reality. \n\nThe film has a more A to B narrative that most of lynchs movie but the film still has its twists and surreal moments,hopper is immense here as a criminal with so much hate inside,he breathes through an oxygen mask for a few seconds and then goes on a barrage of abuse and torture,this is a classic in many ways.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
