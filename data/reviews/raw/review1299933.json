How he manages to keep you laughing and crying and shouting back at the screen is amazing! Again, we are entertained by the interaction between Madea and Uncle Joe not to mention the eye candy of Boris Kodjoe and Blair Underwood. I hate that Blair was a bad guy but he was sooo good at it and she got him back!!! As a single parent of two children myself, I understand why she was so hesitant to get involved with Frank... but if I had a man as attentive, not to mention FOIN, as Frank (Boris Kodjoe), I would consider letting him into my heart! YES!!! And anyone that hasn\u0027t seen their family recently might end up calling their whole family tree after seeing \"Reunion\". This man is truly blessed!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
