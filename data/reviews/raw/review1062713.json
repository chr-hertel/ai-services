I was blown away, I couldn\u0027t decide what I was mesmerized by more, the characters or the sheer prowess of these actors. I didn\u0027t grown up in the Southern culture, I married into it, and wish I had learned to understand it better and so much earlier. I was literally transported to the small town in Alabama where my ex-husband grew up as I watched these characters do their dance. It was riveting. Ray McKinnon has created a masterpiece and his wife in the role of Chrystal was like watching someone go through life walking on broken glass, you can\u0027t help but wonder what on earth keeps them moving but that smallest glimmer of hope.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
