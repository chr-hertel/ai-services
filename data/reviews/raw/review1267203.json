I guess it would be tragic if a film this well shot and expensive was turned down. Think about it, for one, Leonardo DiCaprio, as usual, delivers a crappy performance that is almost laughable, and so does Kate Winslet and the other people in the cast. Secondly, there is no great story- it is just a love story in the midst of an event that everyone knows about. Thirdly, the only reason it won Best Picture at the Oscars was because of the ending which is often mocked in commercials and the main song which is recognizable to anyone. The only reason it was a Box Office success was because it\u0027s the Titanic! It is a major event- no one was looking for a love story! Nothing goes for this movie except special effects and a nice song- PATHETIC!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
