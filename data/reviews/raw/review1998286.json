You get it. Maybe I can go to horror film conventions and have a crappy table in the corner somewhere signing autographs for $5 when I\u0027m in my seventies... For the rest of you: I hope you find some joy in your lives-SOMEWHERE!! We were out to have fun and we did. BTW-I watched close-up and first hand much of the second unit photography and the effects were AWESOME!! John Carl Buechler was the guy doing all that stuff and he was also the second unit director and steadicam operator. If you don\u0027t believe he was up to the task of making the effects better than they are in this film, check out his credits on IMDb. While I was on set, news arrived that the film lab had accidentally destroyed most of the second unit\u0027s film. Bittersweet-lost forever to the dozens who would witness the film, insurance payoff meant that the film had already turned a profit...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
