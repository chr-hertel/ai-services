In Constantine he helps a cop investigate her twin sister\u0027s suicide. This puts them in the middle of the battle between good and evil.\n\nIt\u0027s not easy to say so much about the plot, there isn\u0027t that much of it to begin with. Based upon a comic book, it suffers from an overload of exposition regarding characters and events. It never really evolves from being an introduction to a full fledged feature film. Still, I couldn\u0027t help liking it anyway.\n\nThe film looks great, for starters. It\u0027s dark and moody, the settings are pretty much stripped down to the bare necessities, and ...well, I kind of like that. The camera work gives the film an edge that works very well and makes it interesting to watch. Style over substance can be quite disastrous, but here it works just fine.\n\nThe acting is OK, I guess. Keanu is very uneven, though. Sometimes he really seems to be struggling, but from time to time, he\u0027s actually very good. I found Constantine\u0027s character pretty interesting, with a not always likable persona. I definitely wouldn\u0027t mind seeing more of him and the world he lives in. Of course, it would be nice if they could focus more on the script now that all the introductions are out of the way. Constantine is no masterpiece, but it\u0027s still fun if you\u0027re into this sort of thing.
