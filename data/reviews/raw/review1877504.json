Malcolm Gets stars as a man desperate for companionship. Seeking it in a bar, as we all know, is a mixed bag. In this case the object of his desire is an equally desperate drug addict. Every time Zeno asks for some new form of drug, that desperation builds until mistakes are made. Gets is always watchable, here he walks down a path many men can relate to. I felt so uncomfortable knowing Zeno needed to escape via some drug, eventually settling on poppers as his only means to get through the sex act, leaving Gets even more lonelier than before the experience. The painting of his dead lover watching the entire act was unnerving. \n\nIf you haven\u0027t seen Steve and Adam, (which Gets steals) you\u0027re a loser.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
