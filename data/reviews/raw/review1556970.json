I remember liking it but I rewatched it again just a couple of days ago... and wow. I was totally blown away.\n\nThere is definitely more than meets the eye in this wonderfully told story. I don\u0027t want to give anything away so I won\u0027t say much about it, but there is so much depth in this movie and the messages (such as striving for a goal and the difficulties of it) are just so brilliantly told through the characters and events.\n\nFurthermore, the environment completely captured the now decreasing atmosphere of tranquility and peacefulness of suburban Japan back in the 80s to the mid 90s. After the movie was over, I couldn\u0027t turn it off and had to watch it through to the credits. I was totally taken back by the wonderful environment created by this movie.\n\nI can\u0027t tell you how much I appreciate this movie enough. All I can say is: If you haven\u0027t seen this movie, you should DEFINITELY check it out.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
