Visually stunning and honestly tear-jerking. \n\nThis is among my favorites in the war film genre. It clearly shows us the drama and power of WWII. What do you expect, Steven Spielberg directed it. It\u0027s supposed to be this wonderful, if not really perfect. Future Batman Christian Bale stars as a young boy named Jim \"Jaime\" Graham, who is separated from his parents, and kept inside a Japanese camp. His performance was great, even for a young actor who is less known at the time. John Malkovich and Miranda Richardson are great too. But among the things that stunned me in this movie is Spielberg realistic and stunning recreation of the great World War. The film is also wonderfully shot in Shanghai, capturing the the feel of being in the People\u0027s Republic of China. \"Empire of the Sun\u0027 is really a fantastic tale that\u0027s sure to inspire, delight, shed some tears and uplift the soul of its viewers.\n\nRating: **** out of 5.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
