Since then, I have watched it over 5 times. I think the best thing that happens to this movie is the ending.\n\nAfter the whole searching process and all the intrigues of Alex\u0027s, Matthew finally got a call from Lisa, who then asked him meet her at the park. Matthew didn\u0027t make it and he went straight to the airport to catch her.\n\nThe situation in the airport was a chaos, but Matt still found her. As he walked towards Lisa, everything was silent and \"the Scientist\" of Coldplay started to play.\n\nMatthew knelt down behind Lisa, who just got a call from her \u0027best friend\u0027, Alex. She was definitely stunned to hear the truth. Matt was still behind her, with tears in his eyes. Somehow, she finally noticed that there was someone behind her and when she turned, she saw Matt.\n\nBoth of them shed their tears, hugged and kissed each other, but no words were spoken, because words just ain\u0027t enough to express their feelings. So, the director chose a perfect song for that, \"the Scientist\". The ending was perfect, except that I think it should take place at the Wicker Park.\n\nAnyway, the movie was greattt....", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
