Paltrow plays the elegantly attractive but misguided young woman sympathetically, her machinations developed in a witty screenplay that gets as much humor as possible out of all the situations that she sets up. She does a much better job here than she did in Shakespeare IN LOVE, a role I personally thought she was unsuitable for--never once convincing in her disguise as a boy.\n\nJEREMY NORTHAM is excellent as the man she considers her best male friend and their relationship is developed nicely which leads to a very satisfying ending. All the other performances are excellent, particularly ALAN CUMMING as Mr. Elton, JULIET STEVENSON as the wife he deserves, EWAN McGREGOR (almost unrecognizable in unbecoming wig) as Frank Churchill and SOPHIE THOMPSON (sister of Emma Thompson), who is hilarious as the dim-witted Miss Bates.\n\nWith an Oscar-winning score by Rachel Portman and excellent color photography, EMMA is beautifully directed by Douglas McGrath, who gets all of the subtle wit and tender humor of the romantic situations in a most enjoyable way. Rich characterizations make it all the more worth seeing and the script is a real gem.\n\nHighly recommended, especially for any fan of Jane Austen\u0027s works.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
