This movie is abysmal - I just watched Ebert \u0026 Roeper crucify it - and they are right - special mention goes to Carmen Electra\u0027s horrendous acting- Jenny\u0027s husband directs the film - neither has any talent. This is a train-wreck that\u0027s not even fun to watch. Ugh. If the person who already reviewed the movie recommended it as a film to see at Sundance, when there are so many good films at that festival, his/her friends must hate them now. Avoid at all costs. The acting is horrible, the writing is awful, the camera work sucks - this is one of the worst movies ever! It\u0027s depressing that this got made when there are so many talented actors/writers/directors out there who can\u0027t get their films made. One hopes this will be the last time we have to see a Jenny McCarthy movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
