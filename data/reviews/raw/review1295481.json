The summer is very hot and an immigrant is waiting for his wife to arrive. While waiting he meets a Finnish girl and some drama occurs.\n\nThe director makes his debut here and he has much to learn and mostly about telling a story. You\u0027ve seen everything many times before and so has he. Too many times. But the good thing here are the actors and especially the photo. The camera sometimes \"freeze\" a moment and puts more poetry in it, than it has through the narration.\n\nThis is a first try, not without talent. But the filmmakers should maybe not go to the pictures that often.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
