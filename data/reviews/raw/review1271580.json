I don\u0027t know. With Glenn Close \u0026 Ray Finnes \u0026 John Heard -- and that other guy on Invasion -- well, the cast is deep. This movie keeps surprising you \u0026 you will NOT be bored or let down. I suggest you see it \u0026 forget about the drugs \u0026 suburbia \u0026 see how eventually \"you get what you give.\" The soundtrack includes 1 track from Snow Patrol \u0026 1 from Placebo -- both very great choices. It\u0027s not a pure comedy but the parents are truly real life caricatures. I live in NYC \u0026 I have truly met some parents who ARE these movie characters. Laughable, but unbelievable, yet real. There are no sudden endings that spring from nowhere. The movie unfolds \u0026 the characters always stay true to their parts. Please, check it out.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
