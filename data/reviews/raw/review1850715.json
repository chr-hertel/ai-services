What ever our religions are, we still human being have hearts which beats with kind and mercy and we\u0027ll never do that.\n\nSo why cruelty,what is the point of attacking Islam ? Do you want the world to hate us ? -although the world already do- be my guest! but in one condition (Don\u0027t Lie)or( misunderstand )\n\nDo you really want the truth, then come and live in the middle of the event to see closely with your eyes only, and then you can tell what you want. not to tell what you hear or what you see in the media which most of it is fake and we know it. I\u0027m ready to show you what you want with no effect from me. .. you didn\u0027t deeply live our circumstances so don\u0027t judge us .. \n\nFitna movie - which is a pathetic trying- didn\u0027t move any confidence in me as a Muslima or change it, because i trust my self and i know who i am and what my religion is,and i say to his maker and to his followers :(He laughs best who laughs last).\n\nIt\u0027s just bother me when people talk and do so much work, with NO real aim in this life.also i do have a right -as you people- to explain my Islam point of view to the world ,Objectively and Honestly.\n\nNot the Muslims who are bads, but the bads are the ones who want to destroy Islam only because they hate it or build their opinions on some actions wrongly related to Islam. And if there are some people harmed you by the name of Islam, let me tell you they are not us your problem with them not with us.\n\nI write these words to every soul and every heart with respect and politely.\n\nWe don\u0027t force you to like Islam or to have it ,If you can\u0027t accept us or understand us ,then please just leave us alone,so you can at least comfort your selves.
