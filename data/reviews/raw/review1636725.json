In truth, all it does is waste two hours of your life. Why should we care about a surprise at the end of the film if the entire story up until the conclusion is pointless and unengaging? All we get is tedious plot advancement that wears thin and then all you\u0027re left with is stupidity as you wait for that alleged surprise ending to be sprung. This movie started in a hole with me because of the baffling need to inject the usual Hollywood liberal propaganda to start the movie. We pointlessly go from an evil and corrupt gay Republican Senator to whining about censoring flag draped coffins returning from Iraq to the real plot of this confused and ridiculous movie.\n\nI feel sorry for Halle Berry. This thing is on a sad par with Catwoman." }
