Certainly it has enough \"songs\" to be considered a musical. It is listed here as a comedy which it is, but it is as much a musical. Whoever records these facts for the site should be more careful when categorizing a film. Also, what is its cumulative box office? Was it a number one box office film when it was released? A film has sociological significance for its period and that is covered as \"burlesque humor\", but it also has commercial significance. I don\u0027t need ten lines to ask these question, but the site insists I write them; so I am ad libbing here in an attempt to fulfill this requirement.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
