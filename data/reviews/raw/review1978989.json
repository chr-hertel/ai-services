It improves in the second half, when most of the action gets confined inside the villain\u0027s underground headquarters located on a remote island, and on the whole it ranks as one of the most enjoyable Bond knockoffs of its time. The basic model here is clearly \"Goldfinger\", from the playfight between the hero (Tony Kendall, looking a bit like Connery) and a Pussy Galore-type tough \"bad\" girl who knows judo and leads a female army (though here they are brainwashed via injections), but can\u0027t resist him and turns \"good\", to the more serious fight between the hero and the No. 1 henchman while the clock to an explosion is ticking. \"Kiss Kiss Kill Kill\" obviously does not have the budget of the James Bond films, but it does have its own charm, and there is a spectacular shot near the end when the camera stays focused on an explosion until the \"cloud\" completely dissolves. Maria Perschy is beautiful. The English dubbing is excellent. (**1/2)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
