At the end of this fine cartoon they acknowledged that not only the pigeons, but dogs and a cat had been awarded medals in helping win the war effort. Have there been any movies made in the past to tell these stories? I can\u0027t remember. If anyone could though it should be Disney, they seem to have the wonderful sensitivity to do stories like that. This is stuff that should always be brought up to the forefront to let future generations know the great ingenuity of past generations. What\u0027s wrong with that? Keep the past remembered! Honor those who deserved it. Make more movies, yes - even cartoons, like this. Bravo!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
