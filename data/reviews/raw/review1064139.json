And here is a summary of the ups and downs.\n\nThe Good \n\nIt\u0027s only fair to begin with this, given that it is also the most obvious bit for the innocent viewer. Brad Anderson is simply awe inspiring in this totally atmospheric joint, so dense and sinister you can feel it grow on you. From colors to angles, they all form this self sustaining being which pulsates constantly with death - because this is what the movie is about, no beating about the bush here. Furthermore, Christian Bale - who so resembles Ethan Hawke in this slim version - is just as much of a decisive factor as Brad\u0027s directing, simply because he is so absorbed by his character that he displays an utterly convincing performance.\n\nThe Bad \n\nHowever, no matter how dense or tense of an atmosphere you\u0027ve got, when the viewer (like myself) can\u0027t stop thinking of another movie (Fight Club) while watching this one...it\u0027s bad. I just kept on watching and expected something to happen, something that might\u0027ve elevated the thing, something that would\u0027ve given it some actual meaning, something beyond the macabre curtains of the world. But no, it feels so streamlined that it brings too little of an original story to actually be appreciated on the whole. It\u0027s all well tied up, but totally by the book.\n\nAfter putting it in perspective, the conclusions seem obvious to me: meager concept, marvelous achievement in making it be. Whether to watch it? Yes, I suppose so, but generally some patience is advised for, especially given the conditions (images so penetrating, that I could actually feel their terrible stench...such misery).", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
