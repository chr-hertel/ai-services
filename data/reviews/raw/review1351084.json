This movie, however, had none of this. All that we got was the cheap thrill of several minutes of Eva Longoria\u0027s cleavage (an issue of Maxim is cheaper than a movie ticket). There is an embarrassing lack of plot, suspense, back story, character development, continuity, etc. I would get into specifics, but quite frankly I\u0027ve already-maybe willingly-forgotten most of the movie.\n\nThe entire time I was in the theater, I was kicking myself for not just spending the afternoon watching a 24 season on DVD. Save your money on this one, folks. Unless you really, really, really like Eva Longoria\u0027s cleavage.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
