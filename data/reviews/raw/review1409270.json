Also, Larry King\u0027s statement, in his interview with Star, that Barbara Walters doesn\u0027t lie is equally annoying. Who does he think she is? She tries to act holier than thou but she is totally unprofessional. As far as I\u0027m concerned Barbara is the most irritating one on the show. On one of the programs, they had an audience full of military soldiers on leave from the war and she inappropriately talked about a stain that she gotten on her favorite outfit at a party that she had attended that weekend. She went on and on about it, oblivious to the fact that it was trivial in comparison to what was going on in the lives of her audience members. Also whenever she was on the show, she acted high and mighty like she was better than everybody else. She would interrupt and monopolize conversations and expect the others to acquiesce to her \"holy\" presence. In her one-on-one celebrity interviews, the actors that she interviewed who \"cried\" when she started prying into their personal lives with her nosy questions were sickening. She does not have a \"special\" interviewing technique that makes people cry. some actors will just do anything to get attention and publicity. How she has gotten as far as she has in the media is puzzling. This is a woman who is constantly mocked for her ineptness in speech, yet ABC continues to provide her with a platform to do interviews, news stories, etc. If she were black this would not be the case and If Star Jones was white she would not have been treated so disrespectfully. The way Barbara Walters and ABC \"chastised\" her for the way she left was unacceptable and hypocritical.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
