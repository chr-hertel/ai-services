It really related to some of the things that happened in my past and present. In 2003, I pulled a knife out on my mother and stabbed her. In the beginning of this movie, Augusta does the same but doesn\u0027t stab her mother.\n\nI was a great kid in my younger years but I got involved with the wrong crowd and really messed up my life.\n\nI\u0027m still struggling to do whats best for me but i\u0027m trying my hardest. I have my step sister/best friend/ idol to help me through my hard times. Shes the best.\n\nMy older sister Kaiti, Ryan and I all watched the movie on the 13th on lifetime! It was wonderful. We reminded ourselves everyday for 2 weeks.\n\nI told my older brother Mark about it and he made fun of me saying \"Are you sure it wasn\u0027t the movie of your life.\" Ehh, what an ass.\n\nWell I have to go but I just wanted to say a little something about the movie and how it relates to me in this life that I lead!
