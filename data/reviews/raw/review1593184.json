It\u0027s a popcorn film, if you can hold down popcorn while watching people be viciously and gruesomely attacked by slithering snakes. It\u0027s exactly the type of movie to watch with a few buddies on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nSam Jackson is pretty good, but his presence is lacking at times, as the film\u0027s story(if you can call it that) focuses on many more character\u0027s, including Kenan Tomphson\u0027s hilarious character. This is a funny movie, and sheer ridiculous situations and scientific impossibilities abound(a snake manages to eat a dog in about 2 seconds).\n\nDon\u0027t expect to be blown away. It\u0027s not a scary movie, but it\u0027s a good b-movie with a big budget and pretty good special effects. i enjoyed it quite a bit.\n\n8/10.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
