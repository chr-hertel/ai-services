An American Haunting is a wonderful thriller. I was half expecting to see another blair-emilyrose rendition of a tired genre but was pleased to discover an indie company releasing this film. Even the indies have seemed to scream CORPORATE OFFICE SHANT as of most recently. Ricky Gervais, in character, would\u0027ve even had good things to say about this film. The overall subtext of it is insane. Donald Sutherland and Rachel Hurd-Wood shine together as a disengaged Father and Daughter and their on screen uneasiness parallels his own personal journey throughout the film. He was quite riveting and viewers are never truly sure of the motivations behind his character. Greed, money, or something much more sinister lurks beneath his fa√ßade for no one will grasp what\u0027s really happening until the last frame rolls. All that we\u0027re left with is a resonating fear of film\u0027s theme. An America Haunting is indeed one of the most provocative horror films of the past decade.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
