Yet what really made this show for me was its absurdity and the great one-liners. Although it hasn\u0027t been broadcast in the U. S. in years, some of the transcripts are easily found online, and I have to say: the humor still holds up. (I recommend giving them a look if you can\u0027t view the show, you might be pleasantly surprised.)\n\nThe characters and setting may have been misleading: the rhythm and tone of the show are much more reminiscent of adult cartoons like \"The Critic\" than lighter comedies like \"Sabrina.\" That\u0027s probably why it was canceled.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
