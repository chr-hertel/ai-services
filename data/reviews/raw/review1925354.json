I didn\u0027t get to it, but I did get to the movie. \n\nAfter cinematically traveling to India via \"Before the Rains\" a couple of weeks ago, Brick Lane took me to Bangledesh. With continuous flashbacks to her home country, I followed Nazneem,a young Bangladeshi woman to the London ghetto in the early 1980\u0027s.\n\nAs was common in her culture, Nazneem left home at age sixteen to pursue an arranged marriage She has two daughters, who we meet as young teens, one of whom is as rebellious and difficult as any American teenager we\u0027ve known (or been). Nazneem is dreadfully unhappy in her new life partly because she misses her sister back home. The other reasons have something to do with never having lived life on her own terms, losing her first born and a touch of early mother loss, too.\n\nLet\u0027s just say that the different manifestations of love are examined in Brick Lane through the experience of Nazneem. How her heart opens and how she matures is unexpected. Without giving too much away, there is a drop dead gorgeous character named Karim who has something to do with it. Like a good book, and I suspect this is one, there are delicious surprises. Characters endear us in the end that we couldn\u0027t stand at first and others we admire, fall from grace. The story is rich.\n\nSo, I\u0027ll be getting my copy of Brick Lane by Monica Ali and will let you know how it measures up to this beautiful movie. \n\nWeeks can go by without a worthwhile movie to see, but to have Before the Rains and Brick Lane in the same month. Now, that\u0027s a gift.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
