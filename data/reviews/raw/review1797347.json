This was quite a watered down approach to making a horror film I had ever seen. It felt like he was scared to have any women killed by men - and I\u0027m a girl. I hope they don\u0027t make another one ever again. \n\nThe first one had more of a story and point to it. What was the purpose in bringing Jay Hernandez\u0027s character back just to kill him right away? The first film had scenes where it showed the killers taking the victims apart. None of that in this one with the exception of another chick sitting in a bath tub slicing away this weaselly little girl - even that didn\u0027t show much. The kids in the gang now appear to be a bunch of pussies that are afraid of a guy with a gun? Last film they were throwing rocks at two guys with guns. Another thing - people don\u0027t want to see a girl talking to some old guy in a mansion or talking to some guy at a party, they want to see the victims getting torn apart unless they thought this was PS I Love You.\n\nThere is no reason to see this film whatsoever. This is the first film severely watered down.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
