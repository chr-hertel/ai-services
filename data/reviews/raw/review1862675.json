Not knowing anything about the show, but finding the title hilarious, I figured \"Oh what the hell\". I\u0027m glad I did. As a matter of fact, I bought the season one DVD shortly after watching my first Frisky Dingo episode. Now I\u0027m just craving for more. I find the characters hilarious, especially Killface. His dialog alone is worth watching the show.\n\nWatching shows like The Venture Brothers, I was happy that Cartoon Network was actually creating \"smart\" cartoons geared towards adults. Frisky Dingo is absolutely hilarious and a must see.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
