It\u0027s really more of a film noir, I thought, and I liked that angle. I say \"film noir\" because of feel. This western had stark black-and-white photography with tons of shadows and it had a dramatic scene near the end that was very noir-ish. I was very impressed with the ending, and that\u0027s all I will say as to not spoil it for others.\n\nThe DVD has the option of fullscreen or widescreen. Please consider the latter, because that is how it was presented: in \"cinemascope,\" and you\u0027ll want to see photographer Joseph Birac\u0027s work in all its glory.\n\nFor Barbara Stanwyck fans, this might be a little disappointing because Barry Sullivan is the star of the film, not her, despite the billing. Sullivan plays \"Griff Bonnell\" and he is the principal figure in the movie, although Stanwyck\u0027s presence and character in the story are very strong as \"Jessica Drummond.\" \"Griff,\" along with his brothers, played by Gene Barry and Robert Dix, have more lines than Stanwyck, who doesn\u0027t even come on screen until 20 of the 80 minutes have elapsed. \n\nAll the characters are pretty interesting, however, no matter what their screen time. Those include some strange supporting roles, particularly two lawmen who don\u0027t sound and act like lawmen: Hank Worden\u0027s marshal role in the beginning and Dean Jagger\u0027s stint as the sheriff who has designs on Stanwyck.\n\nTo repeat, this is an odd story. I mean, how often does one see a tornado in the middle of a western movie? Some of the lines in here were quite profound, too, and some were uttered really stupidly. It\u0027s a curiosity piece, that\u0027s for sure.....but definitely worth watching if good photography and odd characters interest you.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
