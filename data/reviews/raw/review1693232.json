I\u0027m not a fan of Arabic movies, and you\u0027ll never find me at the movies waiting in line to buy a ticket to watch an Arabic movie, but I\u0027ve heard so much about this movie that I decided to give it a try, and now after watching it I can honestly say that I have never laughed this much in a movie, It was VERY VERY VERY funny, and I\u0027m still remembering bits of the movie and laughing about them... I\u0027ve seen Helmi before in some lead roles but none of them is like this role, although it is the typical \" silly funny good guy whose trying to do everything right \" role, but this time he\u0027s done a great performance with lots of wit and humor. I also loved the little girl, she\u0027s really gifted and her acting comes out naturally.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
