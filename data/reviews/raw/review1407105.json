TVO always had a knack of incorporating education into really bad story lines \u0026 characters. I guess you can say it\u0027s one of those classics that 30-somethings will never forget. That and \"Math Patrol\" or \"Hilarious House of Frightenstein\". I\u0027m not quite sure if the latter actually taught us anything though.\n\nFunny thing: I was recently watching \"Dead Like Me\" - episode \"The Cook\". I noticed that the waitress at Der Wafle Haus looked exactly like Miss Newton from \"Write On\" (about 30 years older, mind you). The cast list names the actress as \"Deanne Henry\". Could this really be \"Dianne Dewey\" of \"Write On\"???\n\nDoes anyone know what ever happened to Dianne Dewey (Miss Newton)?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
