I received tickets online to go to a showing at the local Magnolia theater, which only shows Indie films. It was definitely worth driving through an hour and a half of traffic to see this film. The movie turns to three different directions but keeps the plot on track most of the time. It\u0027s by three different directors who all have their own styles that work for this film. The first segment, the director does a great job introducing us to the characters and setting up the universe for us. the second director has a hilarious sense of humor that definitely show us the \"Crazy\" in these crazy people, and almost makes us sympathize with these killers. And the third director brings us back to the action, and takes the audience down a winding and twisting crooked road that doesn\u0027t stop until the credits start. I was so glad to hear that this was getting a national release and I hope that people will go see this and experience a truly terrifying, but surprisingly humorous, scary movie.\n\nKego", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
