However, as I watched it, I found myself frequently turning my attention to other things and pausing the film. I was, in short, a bit bored. It wasn\u0027t a bad movie by any stretch, it merely didn\u0027t entertain me as much as it should have. I did have a few moments of glee when I saw some of the elements that WERE from the cartoon, but the story differed too greatly for my enjoyment. Aeon certainly looked the part facially, but she she had as much sexual tension with Trevor as a sack of wet potatoes. There was no chemistry between the actors and no underlying tension. Further, I found elements of the plot overly predictable and rather tired. If you\u0027re a fan looking for a faithful reproduction, don\u0027t look here. If you\u0027re someone looking to kill a couple of hours and watch an okay film, this one\u0027s for you.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
