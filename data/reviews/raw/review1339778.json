Not a bad thing as the rest of the cast shine in this, a particularly good turn by David Bauer as the nauseous, slimy criminal lawyer, Carlton Rood. You just can\u0027t wait for this creepy piece of work to get what\u0027s coming to him.\n\nWhen Simon does turn up, the plot has been well laid out, Carlton Rood has got crooked, murdering businessman, Joe Sholto, off scot-free, due to his legal machinations. Simon soon devises a scheme to turn the tables on both men to bring them to justice. \n\nGood well worked out story with a suitably pleasing conclusion. Although Roger Moore\u0027s American accent when pretending to be a writer, does leave something to be desired!" }
