Eight years before, Robert Johnson had made a deal with the devil in a crossroad in Rosedale. In the present days, after the death of an architect and a surgeon successful in their careers that had claimed to be haunted by hell hounds, Dean and Sam investigate and find that ten years ago they had made a deal with a demon in a bar to have success in their lives together with a third man. Their further investigation leads them to Evan, the third man that exchanged his soul to save his beloved wife that was dying with cancer. While Sam protects Evan from the invisible hounds, Dean summons the demon in the crossroad to trap and exorcise him.
