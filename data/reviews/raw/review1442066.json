Stop encouraging these half baked films. They aren\u0027t what they say you are. They are shallow and lifeless.\n\n\"But they try!\" you say..... \"Not nearly hard enough\" i say\n\nOnly when we all stop supporting these \"films\" will the studios and filmmakers get the idea and perhaps start actually making an effort.\n\nAnd seriously....the worst bats special effect since the first batman. And what a lovely lens flare on the credits......When will everyone stop giving accolades to these horrible horrible films that do and say nothing?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
