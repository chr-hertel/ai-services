Perhaps I shouldn\u0027t have. Then I\u0027d at least have some kind of baseline to compare \"Beerfest\" to. \"Beerfest,\" for me, is without question the worst film I\u0027ve ever seen. No plot, over-the-top \"comic\" acting, crude sexual humor and sight gags, and -- the worst sin a comedy can commit -- decidedly unfunny.\n\nThis film was offered, unadvertised, to an audience for free. The name of the film was not revealed until the lights went down. The thought that ran through my mind before the opening credits was, \"What kind of movie doesn\u0027t demand the price of admission?\" I found out. As the old saying goes, you get what you pay for. After 45 minutes of torture I could stand it no longer and walked out. I\u0027ve never done that before, and now I know what it feels like to be subjected to a movie so awful that walking out is the only option for one\u0027s sanity. Thank God I didn\u0027t put forth even a penny for seeing this movie.\n\nIf you\u0027re a grown-up, do yourself a HUGE favor and skip this film. It\u0027s directed at an adolescent mentality that even some teenagers may find abhorrent. My rating: 1 (out of 10). My regret with the IMDb rating system in this particular case is that I cannot do as Roger Ebert occasionally does, which is to assign a truly terrible film a \"No Stars\" rating. That is exactly was \"Beerfest\" deserves -- not a 1, but a zero.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTE, POSTED HERE ONE WEEK LATER : I wrote this before the film\u0027s official release, which is to say, before the major critics had had a chance to see the movie and write their opinions. Those reviews are now available (check the IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, etc.), and I\u0027m not surprised that they find it an abomination." }
