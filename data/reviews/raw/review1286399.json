The book had a lot more content, in the movie Joaquin\u0027s early years were completely removed, also the end in the book is not as good as in the movie. The subtitles are good but you will certainly miss some of the essence of the Peruvian phrases, they are very witty and sarcastic, nudity in this movie is treated very nice, not vulgar but artistic instead.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
