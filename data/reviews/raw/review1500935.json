The movie was funny and thought provoking, and the message was top notch. Reeves does a very nice job in this movie, portraying his character VERY well. Never before have I experienced this suedo-anime style, which was remarkably refreshing. In a day and age where stagnation creeps into every project Hollywood has on the table, A Scanner Darkly was like a breath of fresh air. Also, it\u0027s good to me that they show drugs as they really are: not some instant fix button that makes you rich without consequence, not some getaway that lets you escape without anything bad ever happening, and not as some \u0027ultimate evil\u0027 not even as the true villain. No, like the movie suggests, it is WE that fanned the flames on the drug market, the sellers, buyers, users, none are innocent victims, and we all have to pay the price. Sorry if I stood on my soap box for too long. Go see a Scanner Darkly.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
