Everything about this movie is right on the mark, its elements fusing masterfully to create a work that far surpasses what might be expected of the typical comic book hero film.\n\nThe movie wastes no time grabbing our attention with every kind of method that works, from intense action sequences to intelligent, necessary character development. Nolan once again selects an all star cast to create compelling characters that we can care about. Although the plot is basically a traditional good guys vs. bad guys routine, the movie is chock-full of character quirks and situational complexities that lend themselves toward the unfolding of not a typical action-thriller, but rather a comprehensive work of art.\n\nThere are so many reasons to go see \"The Dark Knight\". The writing, the performances, the direction, the effects and the movie\u0027s setting...they\u0027re all top-notch. I found nothing about this movie disappointing, and I\u0027m usually a pretty critical guy. Go see it. It\u0027s a juggernaut of talent right across the board.\n\n9.95/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
