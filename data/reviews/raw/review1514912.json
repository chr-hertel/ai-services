I\u0027m so glad I\u0027m not \u0027Kazacky,\u0027 I\u0027d be really insulted.\" And that comment speaks volumes about this film. If you don\u0027t \"get it,\" I\u0027m so sorry because it\u0027s the funniest damn movie in many years- maybe the funniest one I\u0027ve ever seen. To belabor the humor is to take away from it.\n\nI\u0027d call Sacha Baron Cohen the \"new Chaplin,\" but I think I would have had to have lived in Chaplin\u0027s times to have laughed this hard at Chaplin.\n\nThanks Borat.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
