This movie is a 6th-grader\u0027s feast! I say movie, not film, because it would never rank (pun) being called a film, much less draw dignity from any critics or reviewers.\n\nAside from that, it has an interesting plot twist and a few moments here and there. Once you get past all the bodily functions you might even have a bit of fun seeing this once... but don\u0027t watch and eat your dinner at the same time!\n\nIn the end, this was a quick buck aimed at the grade-schoolers using 2nd rate, unemployed, or desperate actors... more power to them I suppose. At least they didn\u0027t pretend to have made a serious work.\n\nPut this in your \"Pre-Teen\" category, or, not quite a \"Teen\" movie...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
