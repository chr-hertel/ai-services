I have to say that as interesting as the film is, your narration and the music is what drew me in. The tone of your voice together with the music was a perfect match. You did a great job mixing everything together.\n\nSturla is a true optimist. Faced with all the difficulties and having the right to feel beaten at times, he still persevered.\n\nGerry is, of course, Gerry. Professional, determined and funny. He went through hell but still was able to give an excellent performance and retain his sense of humor.\n\nEveryone involved with Beowulf and Grendel should be very proud of their accomplishment. The adversity that was overcome to make this movie is amazing. Wrath Of Gods brings to light what sheer determination (and some luck) can do to make dreams become reality. This film would be an excellent teaching tool for any aspiring filmmaker! Congratulations Jon, very well done!!!
