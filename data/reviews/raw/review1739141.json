I first new about it when i was watching a program about it in 2005 and until this year its finally come out after almost 2 years of waiting!!!! \n\nThe only bad thing was that the TV advert kind of ruined it because when i was at the cinema watching a film, when the adverts came on I laughed at the jokes in it like spider pig. But when i watched the film the spider pig wasn\u0027t that funny. But at least the bits not shown we good.\n\n8/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
