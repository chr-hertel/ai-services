Sheriff Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) again has trouble convincing Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) that a shark is attacking. Right away this movie throws reality out the window--Vaughn was convinced at the end of the first movie--why is he so ready to disbelieve him now? This movie ends with a bunch of annoying teenagers adrift in the water with the shark ready to attack.\n\nThis movie concentrates more on the Brody\u0027s home life and their kids. None of it is terribly interesting but it\u0027s better than the scenes dealing with these utterly boring teenagers. Those kids don\u0027t talk like any teenagers I knew (and I was a teenager when I first saw this). Basically this movie has a terrible script which nobody can make work. Also it\u0027s too long and pretty dull--I had my finger on the fast forward button a lot during the last hour. No real fireworks happen till the kids are attacked during the last half hour. Also look for the scene where the shark opens his mouth and you can plainly see the machinery operating him inside! I seriously gave up on this when the shark knew enough to drag a helicopter down(!!!) that was there to save the kids!\n\nThere are a few things (very few) to recommend this. It is well directed by Jeannot Szwarc--particularly when you consider he was chosen to replace the original director at the last minute. Scheider didn\u0027t want to do this movie--he was forced into it--but he was professional enough to still give out a good performance. Lorraine Gary is back as his wife Ellen and she\u0027s good also. Hamilton is very good especially considering his character does a complete turn around from the first movie! The shark attacks are well done and pretty scary--especially when Tina and Eddie are attacked. Still, all of this doesn\u0027t help a film that\u0027s far too long and has a terrible script. This can be wisely skipped.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
