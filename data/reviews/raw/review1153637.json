I have to say, I wasn\u0027t very impressed. The story is rather dull with no twists or clever aspects. Being told in reverse order doesn\u0027t add anything to the film - in fact the movie, which is a pretty standard and pedestrian revenge flick, would have been improved by unfolding in chronological order. As for the camera work, which has been raved about - it comes across like a 1st year film student discovering all the effects with a newly purchased digital camera. The novelty of the swooping and trembling POV runs out of steam very quickly. Worth a rental, but does not live up to the hype.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
