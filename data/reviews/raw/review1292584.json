They didn\u0027t even nominate her, now that\u0027s just cruel. Lopez was so fine in that in movie she was fantastic. She should of gotten something for her performance man. I had that movie since I was 10 years old. Ever since then, when there is nothing on, I watch J. Lo sing her a** off. That was a great movie, hands down. Olmos was awesome in there too. The greatest part was when Olmos and Lopez were arguing about Lopez\u0027s character getting married to their guitarist Chris. I watch that part over and over again LOL. The real Selena would be extremely proud of her if she was alive today.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
