THE HILLS HAVE EYES is relentlessly suspenseful and downright scary... horror fans, especially those who are eagerly anticipating Alexandre Aja\u0027s work after the amazing High Tension may be slightly let down by this movie, but Aja still delivers, with beautiful cinematography and great performances from the cast, especially Dan Byrd and Emilie De Raven as brother and sister. A close family is terrorized by deranged mutants in the desert? It\u0027s a risky plot, especially coming out right after THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and other similar slasher fests... it might actually depend how some people feel about the run-down, been there done that plot to enjoy this film. This was the first movie I actually had to hold onto my seat through, though. I haven\u0027t so much fun or been so scared in a while during a horror movie. It was intensely made and will leave a mark on viewers, whether you enjoy it or", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
