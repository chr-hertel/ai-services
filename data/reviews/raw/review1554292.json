There is no comparison. In fact, if you are into Brosnan\u0027s work, you will find this character very interesting, extremely well-developed, very multidimensional.\n\nThis spy story has a complexity and maturity about it that does not exist in ANY of the James Bond films. The Bond films are about Bond being well-dressed; exotic locales; over the top gadgetry; the obligatory notion of \"getting the woman/women\"; and pure adventure of car chases, airplanes that explode in the air, etc.\n\nThis \"Tailor\" movie has realism. You are riveted by the characters, their struggles, etc. Even though there is breathtaking scenery in the city of Panama, that does not dominate the film. At times, matters take place in parts that are not so scenic.\n\nWhen you see this movie and Brosnan\u0027s excellent performance, it makes his Bond performances seem wooden and one-dimensional. There are also other Brosnan movies in which he was a lot looser: Laws of Attraction, Thomas Crown Affair (1999), The Nephew. These movies with Brosnan stick out in my mind better than the Bond movies.\n\nAlso, Rush was good too." }
