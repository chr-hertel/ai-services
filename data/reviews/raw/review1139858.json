The movie has a sense of humor on occasion, and a central puzzle that keeps the viewer scrambling to put the pieces together.\n\nOn the other hand, it also glorifies the culture of violence that it purports to critique. The commentary track on the DVD shows that the filmmakers are blind to this: did they ask themselves whether their scathing attack on \"frat boys who take themselves too seriously and shave their heads\" was actually presented in such a way as to appeal to said frat boys? Are the endless scenes of men beating each other up necessary to make a point? I quickly started to find them tedious, and began to wonder for whose benefit they were being offered.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
