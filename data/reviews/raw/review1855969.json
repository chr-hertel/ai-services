While living in the house he is befriended by both a P.R. \u0027handler\u0027, Margaret, and the single mom next door, Sarah, who may or may not be interested in him romantically. Over the course of his house arrest, Gary becomes convinced that he is being haunted by the number nine.\n\n\"Reality Television\" tells of a television writer, Gavin, trying to get his pilot made. The house he lives in is the house Gary later stays in. During the process of post production and the \u0027upfronts\u0027, a television executive, Susan, pushes for Gary to ditch the unconventional lead actress of his project, Melissa. This segment was somewhat inspired by writer/director John August\u0027s own experiences in the television industry.\n\n\"Knowing\" tells of an acclaimed video game designer, Gabriel, who is lost when his car breaks down, a situation shown in Gavin\u0027s pilot. Gabriel leaves his wife and daughter with the stranded vehicle and meets up with Sierra, a mysterious woman.\n\n\"The Nines\" is a film definitely worth watching, just for the weirdness of it and how thought-provoking and unlike any film you\u0027ve ever seen. It\u0027s in the vein of, let\u0027s say, \"Being John Malkovich\" and \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\" This is the film where you won\u0027t stop thinking about it and that you\u0027ll talk about it with the people who have seen it.\n\nIt\u0027s not a film that you\u0027ll forget after the credits start rolling. Now that you get the point, it\u0027s time to talk about the movie. Even so, it\u0027s hard to describe this movie in words. When you ask people if this movie is good or not, they\u0027ll either like it or not, but it\u0027s hard to explain their reason and it\u0027s hard to explain why I love this.\n\nThe performance by the three main characters from the three stories, Ryan Reynolds, Melissa McCarthy, and Hope Davis, were all fantastic, having themselves to change their personality so much. It\u0027s pretty amazing. But of course, the movie will arise more questions than answering them. It\u0027s like \"Donnie Darko,\" per se. This should be a cult hit, even though it isn\u0027t right now.\n\nThis is a really weird film and it\u0027s hard to explain anything, as you can tell. All I can say is watch it because the way the stories are told, the thought put into all of this, and the strong performances are already some reasons to watch it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
