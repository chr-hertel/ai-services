Well, it wasn\u0027t, despite a cast that included Glenn Ford and Henry Fonda. Well, even with \"big names,\" there is no guarantee a film will be enjoyable.\n\nThe comedy was very weak and the storyline wasn\u0027t much: simply a bunch of aging cowboys (\"bronco busters,\" to be exact) trying to tame horses, with one of the horses giving them a particularly hard time. Meanwhile, a couple of women harp on those guys to settle down. Halfway, through, I was bored silly. That\u0027s the main problem of this film: a weak story.\n\nAt least there were some good visuals to enjoy, mainly the wonderful background scenery. Sue Anne Langdon (\"Mary\") was nice on the eyes, too.\n\nTo be fair, if I could see this on 2.35:1 widecreen on DVD, I might change my opinion on the photography alone.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
