In the first place, Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) and thief Neil McCauley (Robert DeNiro) are good friends before they realize that they have to be enemies. And even when it becomes clear to them that they\u0027re on opposite sides of the law, the viewer still can sympathize with both men: we understand that McCauley doesn\u0027t want to be a criminal but has no choice, and we understand that Hanna finds law enforcement unpleasant but is trapped in his position. Never going overboard on violence or degenerating into silliness, \"Heat\" is a modern classic and a triumph for all involved. It was, in my opinion, director Michael Mann\u0027s best movie ever, and a very interesting look at Los Angeles. This is one movie that won\u0027t disappoint you.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
