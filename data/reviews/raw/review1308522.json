It works very well as sort of an homage to The Sopranos. There are numerous episodes of money collection and people \"ducking\" people to avoid paying. To be honest, I don\u0027t think I would have found it funny if I didn\u0027t enjoy, let alone know about, The Sopranos. Family Guy has gone a little down hill, but it\u0027s most certainly still in the upper echelon of TV shows out there. I\u0027ve also found that seeing episodes on repeated viewings are actually funnier. I hope this show doesn\u0027t get canceled again. I also hope this comment helped out." }
