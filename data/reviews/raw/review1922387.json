Others have commented on the absence of the \"other worldly\" element. But i think the reason this movie fails is the lack of connection between the two main leads - what couple, of any sort, refers to each other by their surnames? I did not hear one one Fox or Dana. If this movie was meant to cement the partnership then maybe we need a third one because this effort was sorely lacking its human element. I won\u0027t say this film is waste of your time but lets look at it this way; If your are new to the franchise will it excite you to see the TV series? If you are a convert do you to still believe?" }
