It is a farce in the true British, and dare I say, Shakespearian, tradition, and contained great performances all around, especially from Heath Ledger, Oliver Platt, and Omid Djalili, but that is to take nothing away from the other actors, who all played their parts wonderfully well - I did not even mind Sienna Miller, so I must have enjoyed it! Okay, so it would never win awards, if you are looking for a light, easy going film, that does not tax the brain too much, then this could be the one for you! One thing I cannot understand, is the US rating for the film. It is in no way offensive, and I would not hesitate in letting a child of say 9 or 10 watch it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
