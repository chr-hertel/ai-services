But there was another unique Subgenre before: Sword n\u0027 Sandal Movies. Many of later well known Directors like Mario Bava, Sergio Leone, Enzo Barboni, Duccio Tessari and many more worked and learned in this Sub-Genre. Sergio Corbucci was one of them either. He should later become famous for directing Spaghetti-Western like Django, Navajo Joe, Il Mercenario, Companeros and many more. Romulus and Remo was one of his first directing jobs and IMO he did it very well. But Corbucci wasn\u0027t the Highlight in 1961. People went to cinema to watch the clash of two Action Heroes of that time: Steve Reeve (Hercules) as Romulus against Gordon Scott (Tarzan) as Remo.\n\nBoth Actors were allowed to show their muscles and they have some pretty good fights. Next to them there are two attractive women Virna Lisi as blonde Princess of the Sabina Tribe and Laura Solari as an Amazon Warrior. The Story is about the mythology of the founding of Rome \"The Eternal City\". Romulus (or Romolo) and Remo (or Remus) are twin brothers who were wet-nursed by a female wolf. Surprisingly the Movie follows more and the less the mythology with few inventions. In the storyline there are some flaws but IMO not as terrible as in other Sword n\u0027 Sandals. The Action and the Fights are all well shot. There is a high body count but don\u0027t worry no blood. During watching it I got the feeling to watch a Spaghetti-Western with a lot of Horse riding and swords instead of guns. Most of the scenes are typically for this genre: a fight in a gladiator arena, a pagan scene, a torture scene and many more. \"Romolo e Remo\" is a fine entertaining Example for this Subgenre with a nice music too.\n\nUp to the mid 60\u0027s the Sword n\u0027 Sandal Movies weren\u0027t produced any more in Italy. The audience wanted to see something new. Gordon Scott and Steve Reeve disappeared from the screen. Musclemen weren\u0027t popular any more. In the 80\u0027s a new Muscleman conquered Hollywood: Arnold Schwarzenegger.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
