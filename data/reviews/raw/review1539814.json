The most successful comedic playwright since Shakespeare, Neil Simon, has half a dozen of the most popular American comedians of the 1990\u0027s in this 1996 production. The director, Jay Sandwich, was the main director of the two most popular American television shows of the 1970\u0027s and 1980\u0027s (the Mary Tyler Moore Show and the Bill Cosby Show).\n\nNeil Simon always mixes together four or five plots and keeps them moving briskly. In this case three of his four separate plots go nowhere. Only one pays off.\n\nThe successful plot involves Sidney (Kelsey Grammar) and Diana (Patricia Clarkson). Diana is a successful television star hoping to revive her marriage to Sidney that broke up eight years previously. Sidney has been living as a gay man on the Greek island of Mikonos for those eight years and has come to meet Diana for an entirely different reason. The performances here are subtle, sharp, sensitive and sweet.\n\nJulia Louise Dreyfus and Johnathan Silverman try to work a plot about a newlywed who loses her husband at the airport. Dreyfus is pure slapstick, twisting,turning and rolling her eyes to simulate her hysteria at losing her husband. Silverman arrives too late and is too laid-back to improve things. At one point Dreyfus is supposed to be drunk and says to a waiter, \"I\u0027m drunk, can\u0027t you tell?\" In fact, she acts drunk throughout, so it is hard to tell.\n\nMichel Richards and Julie Haggardy do more mainly physical slapstick as a man with a bad back and a wife who loses her husband\u0027s Wimbledon tickets. This seems to go back to television sketch comedy of the 1950\u0027s. One could imagine Sid Caesar or Milton Berle wringing the same laughs from the material. Richards is in his element with the physical comedy, so there are a few laughs here. Brits, Paxton Whitehead and Jane Carr brighten up this episode.\n\nMadeline Kahn and Richard Mulligan go on a mismatched date which leads nowhere. It reminded me of the old television show \"Love American Style\". There are a few faint smiles but no laughs here.\n\nI would say, if you\u0027re a Neil Simon fan, see it for the wonderful acting of Kelsey Grammar and Patricia Clarkson, but don\u0027t expect anything from the other stories. As a whole, it is sub-par Neil Simon, but at least 25% of it is solid Neil Simon at his best", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
