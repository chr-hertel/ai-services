If ya read this.... when are you going to let me design a kick ass movie poster for you!? Anyways I too, also worked on this wacky comedy, which was a lot of fun putting together the \"fixed shots.\" It\u0027s been a few years altogether since I\u0027ve had the pleasure of meeting Michael, who is a great director in the works (also go getter/hustler I might add) ...who I admire. This was my first feature film I worked on instead of just being an extra on films. I was hoping to see a new trailer up, from which I remember was a re-edited version of the film. The Movie captures the loonyness \u0026 insanity that truly is Los Angeles \u0026 the movie industry...\" lala land.\" I hope to see the final version soon. Long live Mashugana! -Jose", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
