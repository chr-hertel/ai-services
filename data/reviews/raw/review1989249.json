Even the film\u0027s most famous line, \"Klaatu barada nikto\" (which is spoken in the remake as well), is more known to genre fans thanks to Sam Raimi\u0027s brilliant comic interpretation in Army of Darkness (a movie Derrickson has said to be a big fan of, by the way). The new version doesn\u0027t live up to the original, but it does have enough substance to qualify as a popcorn movie of the smarter kind.\n\nThese being our post-9/11 times, major changes are required: instead of Washington, it is Manhattan that Klaatu\u0027s spaceship lands in; the robot Gort is a heck of a lot bigger; and the alien visitor itself is actually, well, alien. It isn\u0027t until the creature is hospitalized with a gunshot wound (you know, the US military: shoot first, ask questions later) that the gray skin falls off and a human shape (well, Keanu Reeves) is revealed. This shape has something to say. As usual, the Secretary of Defense (Kathy Bates), standing in for the President, doesn\u0027t care about listening, and those who do (a group of scientists, played by Jennifer Connelly and Mad Men\u0027s Jon Hamm among others) might not have enough influence to stop Klaatu\u0027s Earth-saving \"process\". After all, he doesn\u0027t have that high an opinion of the human race: \"If you die, the Earth survives\".\n\nComing after Emmerich\u0027s The Day after Tomorrow, Spielberg\u0027s War of the Worlds and Shyamalan\u0027s more understated The Happening, Derrickson\u0027s picture is another bleak portrait of our society, which finds itself, to quote the characters, on the brink of a precipice. Whereas the \u002751 version was a warning against a potential nuclear war, the update is more concerned with the environment, although, and that\u0027s one of the movie\u0027s weaknesses, it doesn\u0027t go very far in pinpointing its message. Subtlety isn\u0027t generally a defect, but too much of it can be. In terms of narrative, one might also wonder why writer David Scarpa put in a clich√©d mother/son story-arc which slows down the movie considerably (besides, Jaden Smith is quite annoying in the entire first half of the feature).\n\nAs for the other aspect that could have been problematic, namely explicit references to Wise\u0027s movie, it\u0027s actually a strength, as Derrickson make sure that classic scenes (the blackout, for example) get the 21st century treatment they deserve. The new Gort, in particular, is worth the price of the ticket alone, making Transformers look like an Ed Wood movie. Only the classic meeting with Professor Barnhardt fails to deliver, and that\u0027s because John Cleese is the weakest link in an otherwise fine cast (even Prison Break\u0027s Robert Knepper manages to transcend stereotype). The biggest question, of course, is whether Reeves can pull it off. The answer, which was already present in the trailer, is a confident \"Hell, yes!\": he\u0027s no Michael Rennie, that\u0027s for sure, but his trademark lack of emotion, which came close to ruining Dracula and Dangerous Liaisons, makes him the perfect choice for the role of an alien. In fact, it\u0027s not hard to believe that the producers never thought of anyone else when the project started taking shape.\n\nBottom line: 1951 - an essential genre picture, with a great script, lots of suspense and a chilling central performance; 2008 - an enjoyable revisit, with great visual effects, a relevant but underdeveloped message, and a scarily effective Keanu Reeves.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
