Three other words? Direcctor Michelle Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind).\n\nGive these two a powerful cast with Patricia Arquette, Tim Robbins and Miranda Otto and you\u0027ve got yourself a winner. Alas, the real star of the film is Rhys Ifans, who plays the bizarre Puff, a modern-day Tarzan who discovers the human race after decades of wild life. This weird and ironic tale also includes a lonely wolf woman, highly intelligent mice and a man pondering about his life right after his death. Trust me, it doesn\u0027t get any better than this.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
