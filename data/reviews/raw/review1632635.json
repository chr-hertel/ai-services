Or expand the male character by showing him at work a bit more. The director has left it up to the viewer\u0027s imagination too much. The male character left Seattle for a supposedly great job in Chicago, but we never saw him in an office setting or interacting with other work colleagues, except for the scene at the cocktail party. Also, I would\u0027ve liked to see more of a background of the two characters, such as starting off the movie with both of them still in Seattle preparing for the move to Chicago, so the viewer would have more of an indication where the characters were coming from \u0026 where they were headed. I believe a scene from this movie was filmed at my son\u0027s school and I would like to know where I can get a copy of the movie. I have looked in some stores, but they don\u0027t have it. Was it just a made for TV movie or was it also put out on video/DVD? If I can purchase it I would like to know where/how? If it is strictly a made for TV movie, will it ever be on TV again?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
