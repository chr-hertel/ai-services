Rob Zombie\u0027s take on this genre is the way it \u0027should\u0027 be done! Yes, you can compare it to many 60\u0027s and 70\u0027s flicks that came before, but he pulls it off in such a way that makes it seem fresh again. I know what goes into an apple pie. I know sometimes there may be a bad piece of apple or two, but that doesn\u0027t stop me from eating apple pies. I love apple pie! And this is the best gosh darn apple pie I\u0027ve eaten in a while! Those who love this flavor (and you know who you are) will see this movie again and again. Those who don\u0027t (and you know who you are), STAY HOME!!!).\n\nAbout the music in the film; it mirrors the movie. Have you heard the songs before? Yes, a million times in some cases. Have you heard them put to film in this context and see it work? No, you haven\u0027t. In the past, my stomach would churn when I heard \"Freebird\". This time it brought tears to my eyes. I will never be able to hear that song without thinking of this movie. Will my stomach still churn? Probably, but it will for a different reason now.\n\nHat\u0027s off to Rob Zombie and the gang for sticking to their guns and making a flick with no apologies!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
