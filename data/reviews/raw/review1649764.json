You\u0027ll immediately laugh from the second Jamel Debbouze gets on stage. And believe me when I say you\u0027ll laugh until the end.\n\nThe jokes aren\u0027t far fetched and always at point. You would think that Jamel Debbouze would loose his funny vibe, after becoming well know on the big screen BUT what was I wrong. He really knows what he\u0027s talking about and didn\u0027t make any mistake.\n\nI\u0027ve watched this show every day since the first day I laid my eyes on it and I\u0027m sure you will all love it too. I so hope he\u0027ll ever do another one\n\nMy score: DEFENATLY 10/10!" }
