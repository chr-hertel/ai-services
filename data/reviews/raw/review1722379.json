So it was like a meat stew....with no meat. No build up in any of the scary sequences so there\u0027s an illusion of half-assed suspense but it\u0027s not there at all. Which makes the entire movie 100% predictable. Straight-forward gore, which is not what Halloween is supposed to be about. I mean yeah it\u0027s a re-make and he was supposed to make it \"his own\" but in the reality of it Rob Zombie\u0027s \"own\" is not part of this series\u0027 formula so it doesn\u0027t work and it\u0027s certainly not effective. Immense amounts of cussing so much that it got irritating. Usually I don\u0027t mind, I mean, I\u0027m a Quentin Tarentino fan so swearing isn\u0027t even on my list of pet peeves. But in a movie like this? It doesn\u0027t belong because it doesn\u0027t contribute anything worthwhile.\n\nHe added in scenes from the original and butchered them horribly. The execution of almost every death and \"suspenseful\" moment was rushed and half-assed. Directing was pretty bad along with the editing. I guess that comes with trying to fit so much into a hour and fifty minute movie but still, he should have thought over the final cut a little more before releasing it. He also decided to add in scenes from the original, something I was looking forward to seeing re-imagined. Probably is he rushed these scenes as well and didn\u0027t give them even a bit of justification. The acting throughout the entire movie was either not believable or extremely over the top. Dialogue was bad, you couldn\u0027t believe it. Like, you just thought to yourself; \"People don\u0027t talk like that, wtf?\". Scenes were all over the place and there were many 5 second tidbit scenes that had nothing to do with anything. Like he\u0027d just randomly switch to something else that a character(s) was doing. It usually had nothing to do with the story and didn\u0027t further any story development so you just went \"Huh? Okay....\" Finally, the ending was a bit of a disappointment. It ended so abruptly and prematurely.\n\nNot sure what else I can add except that I\u0027ve always loved the Halloween films, even when Busta Rhymes painstakingly graced our presence with Resurrection. It\u0027s sad because I\u0027ve spent the last several months defending this film and trying to get people to just shut up with their ignorant opinions until they saw it. Now that I\u0027ve seen it, I feel like kicking myself in the ass for all the comments I\u0027ve made haha.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
