The action, what there is of it, makes no particular sense and the romance is dull and pointless. Some lines of dialogue, like the one about \"no paragraph about Welshmen\" (used twice!) are actually stupid. However, the commenter also went over the top himself when discussing the movie\u0027s condescension. Robert Wagner doesn\u0027t say \"Ah, Madame Butterfly\" to a waitress. She\u0027s not a waitress, she\u0027s a famous Japanese diva that he met on the flight to Japan, and it\u0027s explained in the first scene that she\u0027s known for playing Butterfly. So there\u0027s nothing condescending or inappropriate about it, but this detail is so clumsily placed (like everything else) that I can\u0027t blame the viewer for misunderstanding it." }
