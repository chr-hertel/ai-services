I watched the most recent one and laughed so hard that I went back and watched all 10 \"episodes.\" These are great, mainly because we get to learn more about what they deal with at Dunder Mifflin, especially when if comes to Micheal. While Oscar and Angela are funny, the highlight is Kevin. Watching him and Angela fight is one of the funniest things I have ever seen. Check it out if you have a chance. The best episode is the one where Kevin writes a memo about how Angela stinks. Definitely worth giving these three more time on the TV show.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
