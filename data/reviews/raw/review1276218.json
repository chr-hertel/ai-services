Similar to what he does with MDB, Haggis simplifies the story until it\u0027s down to basically broth but complicates the actual execution, a dozen or so characters careening around in LA \"crashing\" into each other with racism as a focal point.\n\nThe film focuses mostly on Graham (Cheadle) a detective within the LAPD (a great performance!) and his navigating a corrupt organization. There are side stories, including solid performances by Matt Dillion and Terrence Howard, but all in all the scenes are so contrived the meaning is laughable.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
