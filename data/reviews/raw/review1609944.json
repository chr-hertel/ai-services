I\u0027m not sure what... but it spoke to me in a weird way ... and very few movies have done that so ill be buying it one day ...not for the $19.99 that hastings has been asking for it but a couple of bucks sure ..lol....if your wanting to watch something that will leave you saying \"what did i just see?\" then go for it, it does have things to offer an open mind ...\n\n(4), vocalist GOD IN A MACHINE", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
