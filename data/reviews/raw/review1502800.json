The writing and the dialog in SCISSORS by Ryan Murphy perfectly captures each character\u0027s actions and emotions and the film moves along with each frame keeping the audience in both hysterics and wonder as to what will happen next. The cast is simply tremendous to the character development which is seen on the screen.\n\nHowever, I did feel that act two was a bit long and should have been edited in a crisper fashion because sometimes you just wanted to take the mother and strangle her for not seeing what was happening around her to her son. And it is the son who shines through and manages to make his way out of the chaos to a new start. Jill Clayburgh is so wonderful in her role and the final scene in the film with she and Joseph Cross is one to remember as finally the son is given something that will bring him happiness.\n\nEvery frame that Annette Bening brings to the screen is a marvel to watch such a great actress...Evan Rachel Wood continues to become a stunning presence on the screen and Brian Cox is truly \"the mad doctor\" here to an array of patients that would keep UCLA\u0027s Neuropsychiatric Institute in business for years. RUNNING WITH SCISSORS makes you take a look at life with the pain of \"coming of age\" and you realize that you were not alone in feelings of anger and at times, abandonment. I look forward to the future \"kudos\" this film hopefully will receive.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
