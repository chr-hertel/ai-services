It grabs you from the beginning and brings you into a story that is fast paced and complex, yet you never get lost and are always ready for the next step.\n\nLucy Liu is cute and bubbly, Josh Hartnett is cool and quirky, Bruce Willis is cold and dead-on. The supporting cast fits in perfectly around the story and main characters.\n\nThe film is visually stunning and although it might totally stand out on its own, it definitely strenghtens the film category it falls into.\n\nThe story and plot are remarkable, and you\u0027ll never see the hit coming.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
