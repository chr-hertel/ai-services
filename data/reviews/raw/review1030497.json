A truly original and inspired take on the whole Dracula thing. What makes this film even more weird is that it is silent but still works. The sets are out of this world with doors and windows at odd angles to each other and of weird and wonderful design and the vampire monster is truly horrific. I just wonder what these guys would have done with todays technology cause in a nut shell this film raises more hairs than most of your more modern vampire flicks out together. Creepy shadows abound as our young hero falls more and more into the grasp of Nosferatu. Its a must see for any horror fan as their is something to be said for going back in time to look forward. This film is undiluted, contains none of the usual normalities that tend to dog down modern horror and whats more the state of the art special effects (1922) style take some beating. Do those doors really open that way?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
