It features many actors. It is fun, colorful, full of life - many plans lie ahead including parallel physiques. You will like this film. At one scene the brain of an experiment explodes in pieces. You will love it when they get together in the conference desk and speak in \"altered states\" until they explode.

For example, how can I control the power of a solar revolution in Earth, or day? You know that the power of a solar revolution is one day: it contains 24 hours or 1,440 minutes. How can a prostitute, for example, control an Emperor? With his body, by being sexy he can control an Empire, if he controls the Emperor.
