While it had some educational value that was about the only value it had. Other sci-fi movies can\u0027t even compare for example Gattaca. It\u0027s not that the movie wasn\u0027t entertaining when it was supposed to be serious, it was just trying to be too serious of a movie with a very low budget, it seemed.\n\nThe quality of acting was awful for several reasons. One it was just the actors were way to into it being really serious and stuff so it made just really easy to laugh at it. Secondly these actors obviously haven\u0027t had much experience, it just shows. The flow of the movie was alright. It made sense but it could have gone a little faster. There were some moments when it just got too long because it was supposed to be \"intense\" but instead it was just aggravating. The science of the movie seemed alright to me but the plausibility of something like that happening on a massive scale just doesn\u0027t seem real. It definitely could happen, like the anthrax through the mail event but it seems very unlikely to me. The ending was way too clich√©. You knew that president of course was going to live and that everyone else lived happily ever after. It was just too perfect.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
