I have seriously looked everywhere for it- to buy--but I can\u0027t find it! What a shame-a true classic, that is shelved. I have searched E-Bay, AMC, Turner Movies, Direct TV and even Blockbuster. It\u0027s just no where to be found. I read that it is very rare to find a copy-and I believe it-and so can you! If you get a chance, and like a fun, clean family movie grab your chance when you see it. You can bet, I\u0027ll be searching until I have a copy for myself and family to enjoy. It doesn\u0027t really fall into any one category, but it leaves things to your imagination while being a comedy, parody, mystery spoof. Like I said-grab it when you can, it\u0027s definitely worth the hour and a half as far as time.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
