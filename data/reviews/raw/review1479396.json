Usually I\u0027m disappointed with film efforts that attempt to translate his work to video. How odd that an author with such historical influence and so many derivatives should seldom be done justice.\n\nSo, it was with considerable pleasure that I became acquainted with the present effort, Dagon. I\u0027m a hard but fair grader. I give it seven stars. This is all the more impressive since it was obviously done independently and on a slim budget that would shame a major studio effort by contrast.\n\nDagon is well worth a viewing or three.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
