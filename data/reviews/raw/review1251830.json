It was called \"The Original Amateur Hour\". On television the host was Ted Mack. On radio it was Major Edwward Bowes and on cable it was Willard Scott. Almost 50 major stars of movies,records,stage,screen,and television got their start on this series. This was a show that made the \"gong\" famous(long before Chuck Barris)as well as \"the wheel of fortune\" and the phrase: \"round and round she goes,and where she stops nobody knows.\" From there,the contestants would show off there talents in between the commercials. Yes,it was a simpler time,indeed. The Amateur Hour made the transition from radio to television in 1948,joining the Dumont Network,then went from NBC to ABC and finally over to CBS. The series was shown on all three major television networks where it ran until 1970,where it was last shown as part of CBS\u0027 Sunday afternoon lineup of special shows,in its final season after 22 years from 1948 until 1970.\n\nLike \"American Idol\",the \"Amateur Hour\" was a phenomenon among the highest-rated shows on radio and then on television. In 1992,a new version of the series was revived on cable and was hosted by Willard Scott of \"The Today Show\",where it lasted one season. Like \"American Idol,\"the public chose the winners,calling operators on duty or sending postcards. Three-time winners won cash scholarships or other prizes. Unlike \"American Idol\",or another show on the same level,\"Star Search\", \"Amateur Hour\" was short on glitz. Contestants performed on a simple stage and exchanged scripted pleasantries with Bowes(who hosted the show on radio)and his successor Mack(who hosted the show on television). No fireworks,no bombastic sound or lighting effects. Ted Mack was forever introducing one-man bands,impressionists,bottle players,bird callers and other acts that were considered entertainment value at the time.\n\nSome of these first-time of struggling amateurs who got their start on \"The Original Amateur Hour\" are a who\u0027s who of great American artists of the 20th Century. These artists included Frank Sinatra, Gladys Knight, Nick Carter, Pat Boone, Connie Francis, Jim Stafford, Ann-Margret, Robert Klein, Raul Julia, Maria Callas, Beverly Sills, Joey Dee And The Starlighters,The Primettes,with a teenage looking Diana Ross,long before she was ever discovered by Motown,and Penny Marshall in a tap-dancing number. There were others too including Robert Merrill,and also a young man by the name of Louis Wolcott,who came to be better known as Louis Farrakhan,minister of the Nation of Islam. By the way,Farrakhan,it should be noted can really play the violin. There was others as well of these great stars that appeared on the show when they were still virtually unknowns. This was a show that became the forefront of the talent competitions shows that were to come. This was a show that nourished those showbiz dreams and went on to become something even bigger beyond belief-long before \"American Idol\" came to view." }
