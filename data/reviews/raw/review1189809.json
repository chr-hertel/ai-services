Robert Mitchum(Jeff McCloud),\"Farewell\u0027,My Lovely\",\u002775, played a real calm cool veteran star of the Cowboy game shows and was very successful, but was beginning to show wear and tear. Arthur Kennedy, (Wes Merritt),\"Peyton Place\",\u002757, was originally a ranch hand trying to buy his dream house for his wife Louise Merritt,(Susan Hayward),\"With A Song in My Heart\",\u002752, and loved her husband very much. However, when Wes Merritt got together with Jeff McCloud, all hell broke loose and Louise did everything she could to hog tie her husband down from very hot women, wild horses, and bulls with angry tempers. Great film, don\u0027t miss it, it will be around for many generations to enjoy.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
