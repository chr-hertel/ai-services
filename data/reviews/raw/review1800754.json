Being a synonym of independent shock films dedicated to the symbiosis between flesh, machine and technology - for which he was know throughout the eighties and nineties - his last two movies seem to deviate slightly from this kind of thematic.\n\n\"An history of Violence\" circles around the idea of how violence surrounds us and how it can be part of the history of an entire country. An ordinary family is chosen, in a small town with quiet lives and a tight community, where everybody knows everybody - all but the white fences are shown. Things seem to change when an unfortunate event puts Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) doing what he didn\u0027t seem do be capable of when he kills two criminals. From this point on we\u0027re confronted with the changes within this family as a whole and those in each of the characters.\n\nThe independent feeling that Cronnenberg carries with him, no matter where he goes, gives a perfect psychological mood to the picture - as with \"Eastern Promises\"- and the pace, always very calm,tells us that this is not a movie about action but violence. Stray by a little and it will fail. In the core of the movie is one of the things he himself pointed out, this idea that it shouldn\u0027t just show violence to the audience, it should provoke people in a way that they would have to make a choice between rejecting what they see or embracing it and desiring it. This is very pertinent since we are used to see people killing portrayed with all the lust and style.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
