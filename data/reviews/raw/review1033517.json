This did nothing to change that basic opinion. The basic plot idea is well worn. A psychopathic killer tortures his victims before killing them. There are enough creative plot points to make this worthwhile for fans of the genre.\n\nI felt that the acting was quite poor. I thought the performances by Cary Elwes was over the top. I like Danny Glover as a rule, but his performance was off in this movie as well.\n\nThe real failure of the movie was the implausible plot. I can suspend disbelief and expect to with horror and sci-fi movies especially. This one went too far for me. Some of the horrors that were rigged up by the mastermind felt more like those from the Riddler or the Joker in the campy 1960\u0027s Batman TV series than a contemporary, serious horror movie.\n\nBefore the movie was over, both my 16 year old and my wife were mocking the script (and I didn\u0027t start it!).\n\nI think horror fans will enjoy this, but it wasn\u0027t my kind of movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
