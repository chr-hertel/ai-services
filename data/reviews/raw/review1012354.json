One of the greatest trilogies ever to reach the screen, and THIS is how they make the follow-up? The two Jedi knights Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) come to help out negotiating a truce between the trade alliance and a small planet kingdom. While doing this they encounter a boy who has the possibility to become the greatest Jedi ever.\n\nOh my god! That\u0027s all i thought while watching this mess of a movie. I have had my expectations shot to pieces before, i know what it feels like. But never has it hurt like this. I had waited for so many years for the follow-up to the original Star Wars-trilogy. And what do we get? 133 minutes of wooden actors reading lines that could make grown men cry, and action scenes that look like a video game.\n\nThe thing that bothers me most about this movie is that all the feeling for what actually WORKS is gone. The first movies might not have been the pinnacle of cinematic perfection. But they had that feeling that made them such a great experience. It was adventure, drama, emotion and action mixed in a way that was every young man\u0027s dream! Here instead we have whiny little kids race-driving, silly aliens and actors that seem to be completely lost. The magic has gone missing! When this is written the third part in the prequel trilogy has not come out yet. The second part was a clear improvement over this one, but unfortunately not enough so. The only positive thing i can think of is that now expectations are so critically low that the third part would really have to hit rock bottom for it to be a disappointment. This is kindly enough rated a 4/10.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
