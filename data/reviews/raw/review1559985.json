This can be more described like Indiana Jones Lite. This is a good movie.\n\nNational Treasure has a interesting story. There is a mighty treasure that is considered to great for any man on earth. A group of knights make a pack and hide the treasure. It has been hidden for centuries. Now Ben Gates(Nic Cage) intends to find this treasure.\n\nThis movie just delivers. This given a PG rating is a really fun movie. Anyone can enjoy this as there is no profanity, and no bad language here to worry about, so bring the kids. There is some fun action sequences here as well.\n\nGates intends to steal the Declaration of Independence for there is a map on the back. How would that be done? The plan is intelligent and clever too. It\u0027s a blast to see how he can do the impossible.\n\nThis movie is also given an attractive cast. The acting is in fine form. From known regulars as Jon Voight to Harvey Keitel, to new faces as Diane Kruger and Justin Bartha, we got a good movie.\n\nThe Last Word: Good clean fun. National Treasure is a really fun ride. Enjoyable for the adults and clean for the kids too. Movies like this are fine. A movie that is good for all ages and is not animated. Recommended.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
