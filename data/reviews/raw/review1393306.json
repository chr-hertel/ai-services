And the chance meeting of Pepper and Charlie in the first show is a switch from usual story lines. You have to wait for the 3rd season to see the main characters together!\n\nI just can\u0027t say enough good things about this show. I love every character except the new station manager. He\u0027s too much of a goof, but I guess he blends in more for the comedy of the show than the old station manager.\n\nPepper Dennis the serious reporter that always seems to run in to a snag. The cast of her sister, cameraman, make-up woman and the rest of her family all work very well together. Not to mention Charlie!\n\nI hope this show is renewed and is on for a very, very long time!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
