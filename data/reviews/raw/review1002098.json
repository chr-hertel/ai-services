My neighbor (an 11 year old boy) loves it! He\u0027s a huge Harry Potter fan and digs martial arts and thinks American Dragon is \"really cool\". This cartoon combines Karate Kid and Harry Potter and is very clever, almost too clever I think at times for kids but again, I had trouble following Yuggio and I\u0027m 34. American Dragon is Asian influenced but not Annimae, thank god, it still has that Disney coated gloss. Some of the jokes are hilarious but may go over the kids heads but I love cartoons with adult humor. There is a lot going on in this cartoon with a WB teenage drama mixed with magical creatures and superhero - Jake saves the day endings. Kids have a short attention span and there is enough here to keep their minds excited for the half an hour. Great fun!" }
