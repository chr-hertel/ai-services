But in the book, the point of infiltrating the fortress was to rescue Colonel McCandless, who knew about that mine planted in the western walls. Because the new plot is to rescue some girl, It just doesn\u0027t hold up. And historically, there WERE no major uprisings in India after the Napoleonic war, so any historical accuracy is out the window. Sean Bean, Darugh O\u0027 Malley and Toby Stephens all did well, but any time one of the girls or that French guy opened their mouths I just thought \"You probably should\u0027ve done more than one take of that scene.\" I liked the flashback to Sharpe\u0027s Triumph when Sharpe was almost killed by Dodd, but the idea that Dodd would have been allowed to live for 14 years is just ridiculous. Equally as ridiculous is the idea that the french would help Sharpe not 3 years after Waterloo. The explosions were fabulous and the production values were the highest they\u0027ve been for any Sharpe, but the story, script, and supporting actors were the weakest they\u0027ve ever been. If only they\u0027d done \"Sharpe\u0027s Devil\" instead. This gets a B/B-", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
