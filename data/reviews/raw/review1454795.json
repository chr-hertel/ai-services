This movie does not aim to move by persuasion (through music, escalation of dramatic action, etc.) but by unrelenting monotony of images that Zhang feels \"ought to move.\" The literal manifestation of the opera aria \"Walking a thousand miles..\" in the main character\u0027s trek through remote China will amuse but for a second; there are many films in which going the distance figures as a significant motif-- Elizabeth Bennett, for example, walks around a lot-- as does Forest Gump. For them it means closing certain distances. Here, the journey is tedious and obnoxious not as a \"visceral representation of the interiorities of the fathers,\" no, but rather as a stilted and somewhat queasy overextention of the camera and the story.\n\nFor those still in the closet of, if a movie is ethnic specifically about an ethnic pastime (opera here), if this said movie reaffirms the bonds of blood amongst estranged kin, and finally, if this movie has smokey-bluish mountain scenes (of anywhere, location hardly matters) then not giving patronage to this film up lands one in the uncultured dog hole--- let it go already. Try some of Zhang\u0027s earlier works, which still pulses with life blood, and which earnestly document the exit and reentry of shattered lives in the world.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
