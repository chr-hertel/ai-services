Trys to hard for noir", "reviewBody": "This movie was AWFUL! It tried way to hard to be \"film noir\" which I am a huge fan of. It was to the point that if it tried just a little harder it would have been a comedy/take-off/farce of film noir. The acting was poor, the plot convoluted and the cinematography was mediocre. Too much of the plot was about everything BUT Elizabeth Short. Hmmmm...just like Pearl Harbor was about everything but Pearl Harbor. Must be a Josh Hartnett thing. If you want to see a newly made INTERESTING film noir go rent \"BRICK\" or see an old Humphrey Bogart flick. My first clue should have been that there were only two there people in the entire theater. I guess or area isn\u0027t great for good films. HAVEN was only in a theater here for one week. Looked good but I won\u0027t get to see it until it\u0027s on video.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
