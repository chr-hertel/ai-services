The plasticine characters are marvellously created, and they move so flawlessly, picking up on every sound detail produced by the people, (its incredible!)\n\nThe dialogue is just as wonderful: Some of it is scripted, other parts come from real interviews. This makes it all the more funny and fascinating. The characters (gorilla, hippo, tortoise, and a very frustrated Brazilian leopard) are very memorable.\n\nThis is a very clever creation, and a lovely reminder of the beauty of stop-motion animation.\n\nTruly deserving of every award it won. Well done to the artists, and especially to Nick Park--a true genius! He will forever remain one of the greatest magicians in the world of animation *****out of 5", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
