Had it been on TV it may have achieved some sort of cult status; it is, however, so COMPLETELY derivative: from Firefox for example; 2001\u0027s HAL; Darkstar\u0027s (Dark Star?) philosophical AI; sequences from JAG; all of the \u0027rescuing-a-downed-pilot-from-behind-enemy-lines\" sequences and etc and etc. (I\u0027m sure I saw Chuck Norris and Sly Stallone lurking in North Korea!) Director Rob Cohen. Hmmm... Lots of producer credits, including many for TV. Is this his first outing as a director? I must investigate that. I wonder if someone else at the helm might have made a difference? Nah. The whole project seems flawed.\n\nHaving said that, it could have been much better. All its antecedents should have made for a better plot line, and they certainly used competent GCI - see some of the POSITIVE comments for this film.\n\nInteresting that the pilots are shown as having the autonomy to morally and ethically consider \u0027collateral damage\u0027 too extreme to actually carry out a mission. Indeed, there\u0027s an interesting conflict between the humans and the machine - in this case perhaps between serving military personnel and the \u0027military machine\u0027.\n\nStill, all-in-all, none of the perceived central themes are developed beyond a two-dimensional aspect. I really would have enjoyed a more cerebral screenplay with meaningful dialogue.\n\nOh well, it IS an action movie and two stars for the action. Did I forget to mention the actors? Yes I did. Make of that what you will.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
