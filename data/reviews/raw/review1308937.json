Behind Bedroom Doors is one of the few I\u0027ve come across with those attributes.\n\nThe new girl next door scams on the neighbor\u0027s human nature and weaknesses where seduction and sex concerned. Chelsea Blue,(I mean Brooke LaVelle) is the choice actress to play the part of the blackmailing seductress, and plays the part magnificently. Chelsea Blue is a very talented and extremely beautiful actress. The movie get\u0027s an overall 10 just because she is in it. Her partner in the movie, Monique Alexander is a definite cutie. The two should do more work together. In this movie, though, Monique, who plays Gigi, doesn\u0027t have a whole lot to do or say. That\u0027s too bad. She seems like she has more talent to be shared. I like the girl who was the (possible) DA\u0027s wife next. I forget her name, but she\u0027s pretty good looking, and not a bad actress. Nicole Sheridan...I\u0027m still trying to figure out what some people are so excited about. It\u0027s obvious there are parts of her bought an paid for. Which is okay, but is she finished? Sorry, but come on! I\u0027m afraid her performance here would have dropped the rating some, except Chelsea\u0027s talent and beauty overrides any negatives. Overall, This movie is a good one.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
