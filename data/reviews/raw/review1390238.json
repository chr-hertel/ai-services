Her lady like deportment combined with her unquestioned loveliness makes her a very sympathetic Lady Caroline. Mr. De Marney is similarly impressive as the sinister, titular character. \n\nBut the film belongs to Katina Paxinou as the redoubtable Madame De La Rougierre. I believe Mr. Le Fanu would approve of her performance. In any case, her first appearance, as depicted with her malignant face peering through a rain lashed window pane, is as startling an entrance as one could hope for.\n\nLaurence Irving\u0027s art direction is superb, (and some of his sketches for this film are included in Edward Carrick\u0027s \"Art and Design in the British Film,\" Dennis Dobson, London) fully realizing, as it does, the stories\u0027 atmospheric requirements, and amply demonstrating how superior sound stages are to location shooting.\n\nAll told, this picture stands favorably alongside Thorold Dickinson\u0027s \"Queen of Spades,\" Terence Young\u0027s \"Corridor of Mirrors,\" Anthony Pelissier\u0027s \"Rocking Horse Winner,\" Leslie Arliss\u0027 \"Night Has Eyes,\" Jacques Tourneur\u0027s \"Experiment Perilous,\" and Martin Gabel\u0027s \"The Lost Moment,\" as one of a small group of visually distinguished Gothic melodramas of the 1940\u0027s, and far superior to the more recent television version, which despite the welcome presence of Peter O\u0027Toole and Barbara Shelley lacks both flavor and mood.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
