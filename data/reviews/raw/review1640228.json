The unpredictability and sensory overload provides the perfect setting for Sion Sono to unleash his brand of cinematic mayhem.\n\nPart satire, part gorefest, part detective story - the absurdist mood and sheer density of the film reminded me of an early Altman masterpiece, Brewster McCloud. Both films demand a second viewing just to absorb all the information being thrown at you. \n\nSono clearly prefers blood to bird poop though, and uses it rather effectively as he launches into several anti-capitalist diatribes throughout the course of the film.\n\nSo, is Suicide Club subversive genius or a sophomoric hack-job? You decide. One thing\u0027s for sure - J-pop is pure evil!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
