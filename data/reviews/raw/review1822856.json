MY SWEET CHARLIE was a sensitive and intense film originally broadcast on NBC directed by Lamont Johnson with a solid screenplay by famed television writing team Richard Levinson and William Link. The film stars Patty Duke as Marlene, a 17-year old, Southern, bigoted, uneducated girl, who, upon learning she\u0027s pregnant, runs away from home and finds refuge in one of those boarded up summer houses on the Carolina coast. Her solitude is broken when Charlie (Al Freeman Jr.) also arrives at the house. Charlie is a well-spoken, intelligent, African American attorney who is also seeking refuge because we learn he is on the run and it is the relationship that develops between these two polar opposites brought together by circumstance that forms the basis of this involving story as we watch instant mistrust and resentment between these two people trapped for very different reasons learn to trust and respect each other. Patty Duke won an Emmy for her superb performance and Al Freeman Jr.\u0027s equally memorable performance earned him a nomination as well. Detailed direction by Johnson and a meticulously crafted script are just icing on the cake. A groundbreaking film from the 70\u0027s that earned so much acclaim that it was actually released theatrically overseas. A classic, pure and simple.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
