These characters go through extremely painful experiences and thanks to the compelling performances by the amazing cast, they take the audience along with them - so it\u0027s not exactly a joyride, but it\u0027s a brutally honest one. You feel so tense in this movie, even when you think you know where the story is going.\n\nWhen a movie delivers some of the finest performances of it\u0027s release year, it\u0027s hard to single out which is \"better\", but here are a few things that blew me away:\n\nAunt Mozelle(Debbi Morgan) telling Eve(Jurnee Smollet) a story , in the mirror, of a tragedy that happened in her past. *BREATHTAKING*\n\nEve and Cisely in the final sequence of the film. *POWERFUL*\n\nLouis\u0027(Samuel L. Jackson) last scene in the film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
