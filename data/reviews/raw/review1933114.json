It contains A LOT of nudity so it\u0027s not safe for children. You will learn a lot about Paris and Berlin in the early days. It made wish I had lived there at that time. It shows that the gay lifestyle has been around along time. The showing of the Pregnant Prositutes that lined up on how long they were due for rich people in Limos to choose from was very disturbing. This is the only film I have ever seen that gives you so much information on things you would have never know about. It also shows why France still hates the Americans because of what we did at that time.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
