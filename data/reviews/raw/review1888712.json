Three lowly peasants kidnap a daimyo\u0027s daughter and demand a tax reform that will ease the economic burden for all the peasants in the nearby villages. It\u0027s all well plotted and interesting for the duration with great performances all around and near superb swordplay action. Gosha\u0027s two Samurai Wolf films as well as Sword of the Beast would make ideal companion pieces as an entry point to the director\u0027s output. Fans of Kurosawa\u0027s jidaigeki work are likely to appreciate it just as well." }
