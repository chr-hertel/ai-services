This kind of storyline was still fun but was now appearing a bit too often for my tastes. Can a great actor save an okay script? Most would say no but I say yes.\n\nHenry Jones not only plays an angel in this episode but his light character is also a time traveller who makes passing comments about meeting Ben-Hur. I am guessing that this Zone character gave writer William Welch a few ideas when Welch would script two Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea episodes (A Time To Die/No Way Back) concerning a time traveller - Mr Pem - played by Henry Jones.\n\nThe arrogant angel/arrogant Mr Pem both appear in rooms with only the voice heard and then they materialize in person. Both characters constantly vanish into thin air and re-appear at the drop of a hat. However, Mr Pem was \"remarkably stupid\" and the angel was far from foolish. Mr Pem was more amusing, more entertaining, than the angel but I can\u0027t help thinking that Mr Pem was born out of The Twilight Zone.\n\nAway from all this, you have to hand it to some of the often used MGM sets in this series. In the teaser we see that famous street, loaded with extras and nice old cars, that really puts the viewer into another time in Hollywood. If watching on a LCD monitor, press the zoom option (to get wide screen) so you can really take in that street, like me, you will want to jump into the screen and be at MGM. The next episode in screening order is much better than Mr Bevis, one of the best in fact...The After Hours" }
