I believe she is fine actress.... just not in the thriller range.\n\nThe Filming was trashy, and like I said the plot stale... though watching it I knew I was in for automatic cheese, I had NO idea how much worse this film could get...\n\nI highly do not recommend this movie... unless cheep Filmaking and poor writing is what you looking for", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
