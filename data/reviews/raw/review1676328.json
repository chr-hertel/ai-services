They lost me there. That and when hundreds of rats swarm a house, a kitchen -- I was on the side of the exterminator then.\n\nOne rat in a kitchen MIGHT be cute. Hundreds are horrible.\n\nI loved Patton Oswalt as Remy and Peter O\u0027Toole as the mean food critic. But Janeane Garofalo can barely be understood under her fakey French accent. (Which raises a good point: how come some of these French people have French accents -- but some have English or American? Shouldn\u0027t they be consistent?) \n\nThey were meticulous in creating a French restaurant kitchen, the scenery of Paris and the animation. I only wish they\u0027d put as much effort into the script.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
