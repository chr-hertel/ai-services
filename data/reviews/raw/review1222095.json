Subjectivity basically dictates the nature of our experiences and understanding of the world. Race, age, gender and class amongst other things make up our subjectivity. The fact that Aviva is the same character yet changes physically has an effect in terms of how we as the audience respond to her. For example, when I went to see it at the movies, there was a palpable feeling of discomfort and disgust when we saw the young Aviva with Bob, because within this context, Bob is a pedophile. When Aviva is shown as a woman, sex scenes did not create the same result. When she is a boy (\u0027huckleberry\u0027) the audience laughed, because he was wearing \u0027girls\u0027 clothes and of course the idea of him having been capable of pregnancy was comical. At the beginning of the film, it seemed that Aviva was adopted because she was not the same colour as her parents. As Aviva changed, the audience seemed to see the film in a different way, and each Aviva changed the nature of a situation so that we laughed, were uncomfortable or confused. As these subjectivities were changed around, the film seemed to be asking if what Mark said about palindromes is true. Is there such a thing as destiny? Could this have happened to anyone? Or does Aviva\u0027s subjectivity affect the credibility and outcome of the story?" }
