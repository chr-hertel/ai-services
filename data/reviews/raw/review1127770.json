If people criticized and reviewed the work done by politicians at the same intensity as they rate movies, perhaps we\u0027d be better for it.\n\nAnyway, on to Fantastic Four. I must admit it\u0027s a solid movie. It\u0027s simple. It\u0027s direct. And it doesn\u0027t suck (unlike this review).\n\nWhat do you expect? It\u0027s not a performance movie, it\u0027s not a character driven movie and it certainly doesn\u0027t hold any plot above the standard superhero comic adaptations. Take it as it is - and for the type of movie it is, it did a pretty good job. If you don\u0027t even like the genre, why are you complaining it\u0027s a bad movie? It\u0027s for the fans, by fans, and it delivers.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
