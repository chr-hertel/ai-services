Kasi Lemmons, the writer and director of the new film Eve\u0027s Bayou, apparently knows the rule and follows it. The movie\u0027s second line is an immediate hook: \"The summer I killed my father, I was ten years old.\" The Batistes are a prosperous middle-class African American family living in the lush Louisiana backwoods. Louis Batiste (Samuel L. Jackson) is the congenial breadwinner of the family, the town doctor with a philanderers bedside manner for the town\u0027s female population. His beautiful wife, Roz (Lynn Whitfield), holds down the homestead, well aware of her husband\u0027s infidelities. With their three kids, Cisely, Eve, and Poe, the Batistes live like most middle-class families. Though on the outside everything seems amiable, under the surface lies a totally different reality.\n\nThe family life of the Louis and Roz is in contrast to the life of Louis\u0027 sister Mozelle. Seemingly doomed to have all her husbands die, Mozelle views life with a grim pessimism tempered only by her faith in her supposed psychic powers.\n\nThe film begins with a party at the Batiste\u0027s residence, during which young Eve spies her father and another woman in a passionate interlude. When she confides this to her sister, she is met with angry resistance. Cisely, an attractive and overly sophisticated fourteen-year old, thinks the world of her father.\n\nWhen Mozelle for tells that a vehicular accident could claim the life of one of the Batiste children, Roz demands that all the children stay in the house. As would happen with most families, the group gets sick of each other, and young Eve brashly confronts her mother with the realities of Louis\u0027s straying. In the interim, Cisely begins waiting up late for her father to come home from work, and comes dangerously close to becoming a Lolitaesque target of her father\u0027s affections.\n\nNobody wants to confront these harsh truths, at least not in front of the children. As revelations build on revelations, Eve acts against her father in a variety of ways, inevitably weaving their way toward the preordained conclusion.\n\nLemmons makes a strong directorial debut. The film is admirably full of subplots and interesting scenes, yet still comes in at an hour and fifty minutes. The ability alone to keep a film under two hours long while avoiding a rushed feeling in the film is something that most seasoned directors seem to have problems with, and Lemmons ability to wrap things up is refreshing.\n\nShe also does a great job with the actors. Granted, Samuel L. Jackson does not need much work to be a great actor. Though his Louis is for him only a walk-through performance, he plays Louis\u0027 weakness in a manner so touching that we almost feel sorry for him. Lynn Whitfield isn\u0027t half-bad as Roz, either. If you look fast, you\u0027ll also catch jazz great Branford Marsalis in a small role as one of Rozelle\u0027s husbands.\n\nWhere Simmons works wonders, though, is in the portrayals of the two girls. While the young boy Poe is largely irrelevant to the film, Eve and Cisely are crucial characters which both require significant range. Jurnee Smollett and Meagan Good, respectively, won the roles, and both of them are amazing. As Eve, Smollett defines being a ten-year old. The irreverent curiosity, the testing of the limits of parental control, the overwhelming initial faith in one\u0027s father - Smollett\u0027s Eve runs the gamut without a hitch. As Cisely, Good perfectly expresses the confusion of a fourteen-year old girl dealing with the problems of adolescence. Both characters display an amazing depth, particularly Smollett. Overall, a great film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
