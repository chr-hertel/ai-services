With shades of Independence Day the film is well-crafted, suspenseful, and at times exciting, but the script leaves too many questions unanswered and never really delivers the way you\u0027d hope for. Starts with a bang and works well as a thrill ride likely to please action fans, but those looking for a fresh, inventive sci-fi feature probably won\u0027t be impressed. Hats off to the special effects crew, and watch for Tim Robbins who undoubtedly has the film\u0027s best role. **Â½" }
