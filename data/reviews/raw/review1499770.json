Everything was fast paced and complex. The thing that bothered me most is the mindless killings!! Honestly every main character was shot!! WTf?? And how many times was the f word used in there?? A lot. This movie over all is great, take away the mindless shooting and swearing and the movie is almost fantastic.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio did an excellent job portraying an inside cop with issues and pressure not to get caught. This is one of his better acting films. But of course he got shot, it was like watching Jack Dawson float to the bottom of the ocean again. Heartbreaking. But since everyone else dies, you barely notice he\u0027s gone.\n\nOverall: exceptional, great story line, to much blood, swearing, too much violence.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
