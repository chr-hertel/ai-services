I am so glad it is being made into a movie. This is one of those games that absolutely deserves its own movie. Along with Super Mario, (yes it was a movie), Resident Evil, and Tomb Raider, this game is one who should have had a movie long before. But this review isn\u0027t about the movie. But before I go on, I hope to God that the guy who did the voice of Master Chief (A.K.A Spartan-117) is the voice of MC in the movie. Anyway, the first time I played this game was with some of my close friends while drinking soda out of shot glasses. We were playing the field multi-player map, and we were having a blast. We would kill each other just to see Master Chief from the outside. His armor is so COOL! The vehicles are also awesome, especially the Ghost and Scorpion tank. Good grief, that tank is big! (P.S. If you play Halo 2 and find a Scorpion with the weird shield things near it on the level, destroy the shields with the tank. Park the Scorpion over where the shield is. When the shield comes back, WHEEEE!!! The tank will do an elegant aerial ballet. Fun fun fun!) The multi-player is just one of the amazing attributes of this game! The levels are will designed, with Covenant soldiers around every corner. Though it is easy, its one of those games that just keeps you entertained by watching how far the Grunts fly when you shoot them with a Needler! I hope I spelled that right... If I had to rate this game on a scale of one to ten, I would definitely give it a 4 million!" }
