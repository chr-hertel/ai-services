It is one that I will definitely enjoy again in the future and share with my family and friends.\n\nTo those in Hollywood that think you cannot sell a film without sex, violence, and F-Word fillers, THINK AGAIN! This is what the majority of Americans want to spend their most precious commodity (time) and money on.\n\nWhat a treasure find this film is!" }
