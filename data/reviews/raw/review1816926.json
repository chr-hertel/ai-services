The two leads are fleshed out so deeply that, by the film\u0027s end, you know exactly why these two men are doing what they\u0027re doing, without need of explanatory dialogue or rich narration. And it\u0027s complimented by two of the best performances of the year: Pitt\u0027s rogue, mysterious, and near-evil outlaw contrasted perfectly with Affleck\u0027s quiet, awkward, and off-putting coward. I think it\u0027s fascinating how Ford is the real protagonist of the film, and how his consuming desire to become Jesse James culminates in a devastating and fitting finale. Coupled with the beautiful cinematography (I particularly loved the shots with the hazy edges) and the terrific score, this is a character study of the highest order.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
