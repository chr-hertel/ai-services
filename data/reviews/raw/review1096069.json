I love how Frankie is, though; she\u0027s like, the leader of the pack and stuff...plus the actress is really pretty. But I don\u0027t like how Fliss acts...sometimes she just overreacts in the way she talks...\n\nOverall, the acting could be improved, and the script and writing could be tweaked a little bit. Maybe a bit more characters every now and then. But nevertheless a good show to keep me entertained during weekday afternoons :)" }
