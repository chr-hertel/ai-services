Is it a big budget, multi-million dollar film. No. But the cool thing is that it doesn\u0027t try to be. My boyfriend bought this because he loves zombie films and gets everything. I really didn\u0027t want to see it but then found myself really liking the priest, the girl in the house and the Jehovah\u0027s witness. They were like real people and the story was fresh and compelling. I even got quite a few chuckles out of it. It wasn\u0027t a bloodfest but rather a story with multiple threads and some nice surprises. The actors were competent but the script was what helped to raise this thing up beyond what I expected.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
