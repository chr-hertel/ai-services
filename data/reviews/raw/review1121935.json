Criticisms for story and lack of coherence are usually the main issues. The film has has a sad reputation overall, but the atmosphere and cinematography makes up for any shortcomings in the script. The cast-particularly Kinski and Abril really make the film. Depardieu\u0027s dedication is serious enough as the lead protagonist. Check the works of Kinski and you\u0027ll find no other film of hers giving the aura and beguiling beauty display in The Moon In the Gutter. Regardless,the movie is better than most coming out these days. I would rank it highly with films like \"Betty Blue\" and the works of Almodovar and Polanski.Hopefully, a proper DVD issue of some kind is imminent.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
