It deals with the issue of heroism and it\u0027s political value in wartime. Woodrow Truesmith (Eddie Bracken) is a 4-F who has been working in California in a plant because he could not get drafted. But his family and neighbors expect him to be in the army. His father was a war hero in World War I (he was named Woodrow Lafayette Pershing Truesmith after President Woodrow Wilson, General John Pershing, and the Marquis of Lafayette - supposedly Pershing\u0027s staff Major, Charles Stanton, made the statement \"Lafayette we are here\" when our troops arrived to help the French in 1918 - so that Woodrow was born about 1918). Bracken has lied in letters to his mother that he is a marine and a hero. He tells this to a small group of Marines, led by William Demerest (and including one named Bugsie, played by former boxer Freddie Steele) who decide to accompany him back to his home on their furlough. They go with him, and back up his lies, so that Bracken finds himself the town\u0027s leading hero - and a potential piece of political timber.\n\nThe town is run by two men, Al Briggs (the quiet but intelligent town boss) and Raymond Walburn, the richest man in town who is the mayor as well: Everett Noble. Walburn is always blustering, but he basically knows what\u0027s what. However it is Briggs who asks the right questions. When the reform party nominates Woodrow for Mayor, Briggs asks, \"I wonder if he really is a hero?\" And he starts making inquiries.\n\nThey have an unwitting ally: Woodrow himself. He finds the expansion of his lies too much pressure on him, and he questions it\u0027s value. But he can\u0027t buck his mother, his girlfriend (Ella Raines), nor Demerest, Steele, and the other Marines. They\u0027ve learned that Woodrow is the only hope for the town\u0027s future because it\u0027s currently somewhat shoddy and corrupt in it\u0027s goals and actions. They can\u0027t let Woodrow confess.\n\nWhat makes a hero? In HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO, set in the middle of WORLD WAR II, it turns out that heroism is not only found on a military front or battlefield, but can be found on the home front as well. It can take many forms, and sometimes it is at great personal humiliation and hurt. Bracken never had a better role (except for his other starring role for Sturgis in THE MIRACLE OF MORGAN\u0027S CREEK), and demonstrate the growth of his moral stature quite well. Demerest, Walburn, Raines, Briggs all do well (Demerest in an oddly different role - he\u0027s a soldier, not a wise guy), and Freddy Steele\u0027s \"Bugsie\" is a wonderful portrait of a slightly mentally ill soldier with a mother fixation. Steele had a a career in movies in the 1940s, mostly in bit roles. This was his best performance.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
