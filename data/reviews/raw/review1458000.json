There was nothing in this film that was appealing. With each setting, it seemed like the designers got better at creating the backdrop for where the story took place; however, the settings don\u0027t make the movie.\n\nThe biggest reason for its failure was the complexity of the plot. What was the writer trying to bring across with each scene he wrote. It seemed liked it dragged on longer than necessary. Besides the drawn out and complex plot, the ending was very tedious. \n\n\"The Cell\" did serve one purpose: it was a lesson for me to tell all to avoid renting this film." }
