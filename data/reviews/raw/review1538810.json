The movie started out with a great deal of promise, showcasing some of the ephemeral aspects of the movie biz. Tea Leoni was cute, intelligent, and funny as Val Waxman\u0027s ex wife, while Treat Williams as Hal Yeager, the studio head, and George Hamilton as his associate seemed well drawn, as well, especially their frank discussions about Val\u0027s has-been status. Further, Val\u0027s agent (not sure of the actor\u0027s name) delivered one of the flick\u0027s more notable performances. The movie built steadily through the scene in the restaurant where Val met with Tea after signing the deal and suddenly began berating her for leaving him to live with Hal. Many comedic possibilities that lay ahead remained to be explored when his attack of hysterical blindness sent the picture in an entirely unexpected direction. I didn\u0027t care for it at all the first time I saw it, but tolerated it much better upon a second viewing. I\u0027ve decided that this is a pretty good movie, with some funny lines and situations, although I think the blindness routine took the story down a notch or two.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
