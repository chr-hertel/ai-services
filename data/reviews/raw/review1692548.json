The fast-paced format drew me in, but I stayed for all the nifty scientific and culinary facts I was learning.\n\nAfter the episode \"True Brew,\" I gave coffee another chance, and became a Good Eats fan for life. I love how, well, anal he is about good food and good cooking, and although I don\u0027t agree or follow everything he says, I did incorporate a lot of what he\u0027s said into my cooking. And I do have a stand mixer with flames painted on the side...\n\nAfter five years or so of being a fan, I\u0027ve tried several of the recipes from the show, and all of them come out great. Though I get better results by watching the show *and* following the written recipe.\n\nNow that he\u0027s done an Okra episode, I\u0027ve got to re-evaluate my fear of Okra, which goes way back to when they served fried, breaded okra in my North Texas cafeteria.\n\nDarn that Alton Brown and his ability to get me to try new things!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
