It can ruin everything or it can throw magi dust on the one and a half hour, where you where bored as hell. \n\nI actually didn\u0027t find the this episode so special along the way, but the end is pretty breath taking and makes this little short movie as a hole stand out as little masterpiece. It leaves you with this magical feeling of not really knowing what the movie you just saw was about. Is it about sexuality, nature or just something unspeakable? The answer remains a question.\n\nThe acting is also not that bad, especially when you consider it is a TV-movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
