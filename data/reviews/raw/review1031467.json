When he was a successful singer and bedded Celia (Valentina Vargas, who didn\u0027t need to speak to make her part in \"The Name of the Rose\" to make it highly memorable), a nightclub dancer with a mobster boyfriend. Samuel Fuller\u0027s swansong, is interesting, despite Carradine\u0027s horrid songs.Not the best Fuller film by a long shot, but still watchable.\n\nMy Grade: C- \n\nDVD Extras: commentary with Keith Carridine; a 32 minute Behind the scenes featurette; Text interview; and Theatrical Trailer\n\nEye Candy: Valentina Vargas shows it all", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
