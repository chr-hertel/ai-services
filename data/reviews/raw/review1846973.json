Well, since it was out in the cinemas, at least. Always spotted another movie and went to see that one instead. So I just FINALLY rented it today. And I must say something, I am disappointed I didn\u0027t see it on big screen. It was amazing. A real \u0027chef d\u0027oeuvre\u0027. It was extremely touching, the characters are well played. I never thought I\u0027d be that emotive over that movie. I have now the urge of going to buy it as soon as possible so I can watch it over and over again. It makes my inner kid dream, makes my heart swell with hope and happiness. I definitely would recommend it to anyone who\u0027d ask me if it is good or not.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
