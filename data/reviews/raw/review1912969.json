Unfortunately I was very disappointed. Although HB\u0027s character is cool and well played, the supporting characters were too mellow in comparison. The villain wasn\u0027t particularly evil either and the golden army was really quite childish I thought. But those things aside, the whole story came off as quite cheesy and misplaced. It does not carry the kind of dark tone that the character deserves. I wouldn\u0027t recommend this film, despite it\u0027s obviously big budget, action sequences, occasional witty line and feigned attempt at greatness. Thumbs down.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
