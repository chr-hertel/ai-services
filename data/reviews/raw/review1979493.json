I knew that it was supposed to be marvelous and therefore I had high expectations right for the start. And, thank God, I wasn\u0027t disappointed at all!\n\nJulia plays a stalwart, authoritative, somewhat arrogant woman with amazing adroitness. She is so good in this role that you ignore all her cursing and yet love her. Albert Finney too plays his role well though I thought that he could have been better in some shots. Eckhart too does a really good job as a \u0027maid/lover\u0027 of Erin .\n\nWhat I feel that could have improved was the character development. I felt that nothing changed in the character\u0027s traits. Also, some of the sub-plots could have been handled better. Its a monster of a story and that\u0027s why probably it wasn\u0027t possible to focus on all the characters and give them more attention.\n\nThe story is absolutely tremendous with fabulous and witty dialogs. The \"It\u0027s called b00bs\" line is my favorite. The ending is satisfactory. The main punch of this movie is that it never gets dull even though its a bit long. Well, to be frank, I felt that they could have increased the pace in some of the scenes but that didn\u0027t make it completely unenlightening.\n\nOverall, I\u0027m going to give this an eight. Don\u0027t forget to catch it on the television. If this 15 year old loves it, then I feel that it would be relished by almost anyone.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
