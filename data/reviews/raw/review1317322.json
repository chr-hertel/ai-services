I love watching Brosnan in any movie, he\u0027s always good, but this was totally different. He\u0027s a mess, and plays being a mess very well. In fact he reminded me of myself a few times back in uni :) So yes, there\u0027s not a lot of violence, there\u0027s not a lot of action, but the dialogue is cracking, the acting is superb and very refreshing, and it\u0027s pretty funny too :) I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll come out of the cinema going \"Wow! I was blown away\", but you\u0027ll come out smiling having enjoyed a good film. Can\u0027t ask for more than that.\n\nOh, and if you\u0027re lucky, some moron will put the adverts reel in wrong and you\u0027ll get inverted, upside down, reversed (with reversed audio) adverts!! Brilliant. Nothing like watching a Jack Daniels ad where the drink goes back into the bottle from the glass with a gruff American \"Twin Peaks\" commentary :)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
