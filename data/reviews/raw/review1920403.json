It\u0027s subtly sinister without resorting to the overused shock tactics and crudely managed special effects so often used to shore up truly poor examples of the genre. i\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s intentional, but i found my sympathies going towards the so-called villains, which is some achievement. they have a warped morality and a sense of suffering. unlike the obnoxious elizabeth who may or may not get what she deserves.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
