You could see the magic between Annabelle (Erin Kelly) and Simone (Diane Gaidry). Even though Simone fought it because of her position, it was apparent that it was going to be a losing battle, as Annabelle was just too strong and too convinced that her feeling were the real thing.\n\nLove. Everything else we do in life is just a prelude to finding it. Some never do. When it happens, nothing else matters.\n\nThis was a beautiful film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
