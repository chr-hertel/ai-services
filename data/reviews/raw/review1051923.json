As fellow commenter Snow Leopard said, the film is rather episodic to begin. Some of it is amusing, such as Pickford whipping her clansmen to church, while some of it is just there. All in all, the story is weak, especially the recycled, contrived romance plot-line and its climax. The video I saw is so dark it\u0027s difficult to appreciate the scenery, but even accounting for that, this doesn\u0027t appear to be director Maurice Tourneur\u0027s best work. Pickford and Tourneur collaborated once more in the somewhat more accessible \"The Poor Little Rich Girl\", typecasting Pickford in childhood roles.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
