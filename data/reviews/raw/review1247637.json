Like many other reviewers i came across what can only be described as a piece of poopy in a gold wrapper. The front cover is great, and the comment on the back is mesmerising - \u0027it will scare the crop out of you\u0027...oh how i chuckle looking back at such naivety and ignorance.\n\nOne of the many things scarier than this movie is the acting skills of these \u0027actors\u0027. I think, no, i did actually cheer when they got slashed up by these \u0027scarecrows\u0027, who were wearing some classic fancy dress costumes. I used to drive quite quickly past cornfields as i found them to be pretty scary at night, but having seen this movie, i nearly wet myself (through laughing so much) just at the sight. \n\nI have seen scarier omelette\u0027s quite honestly, not mine though, i\u0027m a dab-hand at cooking omelette\u0027s, and if anyone associates this movie with my omelette\u0027s, let\u0027s just say that i would create a situation in which they would be forced to watch this movie 3 times in a row.\n\nIf anyone has any good corn movies they can recommend, feel free to inform me. It\u0027s a great comedy if nothing else, OK it is nothing else. Enjoy, but a little advice - before pressing the play button on your DVD player, throw it out of the window.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
