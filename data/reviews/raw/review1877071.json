I caught this crap right from the beginning! I thought I recognized Cullen, and the old Transco Tower. Then I thought I saw the old Allen Parkway! What is this. I perked up for a minute, and then why oh why did I start to pay attention to the \"acting\"? It was a terrible. The kung fu was pitiful, the plot was even worse. It was so stupid I had to call my best friend to see if she was watching the same crap I was, and lo and behold!!!! My friends, she was witnessing the same thing I was!! It was amazingly awful what this director has never to record this for prosperity. This movie is so damn dumb I hope no one ever takes it as a serious slice of real thug life....this was so sad. I did recognize some homies in the film though. Don\u0027t be mad cause your girl didn\u0027t like it. We are still cool! I hope y\u0027all got paid!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
