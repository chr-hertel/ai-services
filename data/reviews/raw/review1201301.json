Russell Crowe \u0026 Jennifer Connelly :) Very hard to top this movie for those fans who consider themselves to be(semi)intellectuals :) The complex subject of schizophrenia is explained in a way I have never seen before. Around this central theme, another very moving story evolves of true love by an incredibly courageous \u0026 wise partner as played very convincingly by Jennifer Connelly. The special traditions and customs of a typical upper class University add yet another fine flavor to this superb movie. Well deserved awards, but too few as Russell Crowe is simply magnificent :)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
