A masterpiece? No, of course not. The result is something so absurdly different from the original that there\u0027s simply no reason to acknowledge any connection between the two. Just think of Seisohen as something else. A different story with different characters.\n\nWe know that Kenshin wants to redeem himself for the blood he spilled during the revolution, but who knows why, in Seisohen he decides to go to China to kill even more people. The impression is given that Kenshin\u0027s lust for blood is so strong that he goes sneaking out at night killing people... because he can\u0027t escape his cruel destiny of a killer. The whole story behind the Reverse blade sword is lost. The motive of redemption through helping people is lost. \n\nIf you\u0027ve seen the original series, watching Seisohen will probably give you the feeling that all the main characters are on drugs, terminally ill or suicidal. You might ask: \"What the hell happened to everyone?\" or \"Is the Ghost of Christmas future showing me this?\" No, you\u0027re simply watching a different show. Something as absurd as a melodrama based on \"South Park\" or a comedy based on \"Schindler\u0027s list\". Just imagine.\n\nThe ending of Rurouni Kenshin is Episode 95: \"End of Wanderings\". That\u0027s it. Only watch Seisohen if you haven\u0027t seen the original, otherwise you\u0027ll be sorry.\n\nAn objective 2 stars out of 10 because the plagiarism and melodramatism negate anything achieved by the animation.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
