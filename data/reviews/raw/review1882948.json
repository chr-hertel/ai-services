It even gave me nightmares for a while and a film has\u0027nt done that since beetlejuice! (i was young when i watched it) i have\u0027nt read the book but a book would\u0027nt ruin this film that other comment about it is rubbish. It\u0027s one of the best newish horror films i\u0027ve see in many years and it re-newed my phobia of certain bugs. Its a perfect Friday night in film with the mrs but keep hold of the popcorn if shes scared of creepy crawlys!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
