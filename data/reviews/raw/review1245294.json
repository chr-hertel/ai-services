Marketing actually suckered me into buying these overpriced clay pigeons? Gantz is a series that had potential. The main reason I bought this was because it claimed to be shocking and because it looked like a promising gore-fest. Well it isn\u0027t. The fact that some of the episodes are bloody doesn\u0027t make up for the crap-tastic voice actors or the annoying character personalities. It\u0027s a shame when I can watch a grandma and her child die and feel no remorse for either one of them. That\u0027s how annoying the voice acting and character personalities are. I actually wanted to grab the main character by the neck and kill him just to end the series early. The enemies are kinda cool though. The weird bird characters in the robot suits were my favorite ones. The weapons are also very interesting. But the setting for the battles is retarded. I was expecting the Gantz players to travel to alien worlds, or just morbid parallel dimensions, but rather than do something like that they battle in the middle of Tokyo. Honestly if you can get past a not-so-shocking story, annoying character voices/personalities, the main character\u0027s obsession with breasts, and the lack of a creative battle ground then maybe you\u0027ll enjoy this. 4/10. It could\u0027ve been so much more.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
