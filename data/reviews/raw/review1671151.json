He was replaced by Susannah York as Superman\u0027s mother in an \"artistic\" decision that made absolutely no sense and destroyed the whole father-son element of the story, which gets a moment to shine in this cut.\n\nLois Lane (Margot Kidder) actually has a purpose here beyond \"damsel in distress.\" Once again, she is actually a part of the movie (it\u0027s refreshing to see her not screaming). On a related note, the entire Paris terrorist sequence is removed from the movie along with the subplot, making the film a more cohesive whole.\n\nGene Hackman and Valerie Perrine are, as usual, hilarious together (watch Miss Teschmacher\u0027s extended quest to find the bathroom at the Fortress of Solitude), and Christopher Reeve still makes us believe he can fly, in the air and in space. But somehow it wasn\u0027t the same without Richard Donner\u0027s name in front.\n\nP.S.: Watch the opening credits... it\u0027s that amazing laser effect again!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
