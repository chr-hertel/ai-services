Well, that\u0027s true, but many films have done that and the tale they\u0027ve told is sad (Ponette) or even harrowing (Ã€ ma soeur!). What this film captures is the divine reality that children and some adults are in contact with. It also relates the many other parts of a boy\u0027s role in a struggling Jewish Canadian family of the 20\u0027s, and does that quite well.\n\nHowever, the mystery at the heart of life, the divine connection, that\u0027s what this film depicts best.\n\nAlas, it\u0027s never been released in ANY consumer format! Who do we talk to about this injustice!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
