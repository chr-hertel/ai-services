As I have always said, a book is a book, and a movie is a movie, and there should not be any comparison in a review.\n\nThis was an interesting movie in many respects. It was a good thriller; like an episode of \"Law and Order\" and \"CSI\" together. I don\u0027t really like Dennis Farina, so I am glad he was just a peripheral player.\n\nI like seeing William Petersen long before he was tapped for his \"CSI\" role. I hardly recognized him at first. It is easy to see why he got the role because he exhibited many of the same qualities in this film.\n\nMichael Mann (Heat, Miami Vice, Collateral) does a good story in this genre and I really enjoyed his writing and directing of this film.\n\nVeteran actor Brian Cox made a great Hannibal Lecktor, and was so much more of what a serial killer should be that later reincarnations of the character.\n\nA really interesting movie that was only weakened by the fact that is was in the style of the 80s.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
