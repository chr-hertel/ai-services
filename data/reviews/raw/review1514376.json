The main singers were: Tennessee Ernie Ford (of \"Sixteen Ton\" fame) who sang country or a gospel hymn, Petula Clark (\"Down Town\", etc.), Carol Lawrence with her beautiful voice. Melba Moore who sang \u0027rhythm and blues\u0027 music. Then we had (have) the great Wayne Newton whose Las Vegas style brought him fame. Jerry Trent was the incredible dance talent who was fun to watch.\n\nErnie Ford, Petula Clark and Wayne Newton are best remembered singers from this show. But Carol went on to do well as a guest star in many a TV series. And Melba, who was known for her 4 range octave singing voice, had received a Tony for \"Purlie\" (1970). It was the beginning of her singing and TV career.\n\nThis show came out in 1973. I think it was very wrong timing. The music used was going out of style and retro wasn\u0027t in yet. If something similar came out today there would be a ready made backing of younger fans to join the older ones." }
