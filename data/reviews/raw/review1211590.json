And not in a good way.", "reviewBody": "I cannot believe a single person found ANY merit in this total waste of time.\n\nSeriously. The writing was unbearably awful - incoherent, muddled and just plain amateur. Really, I don\u0027t mean to go over the top here but aren\u0027t message boards supposed to be somewhat objective? The acting was no better than a high school performance and the plot line was so all over the place I could barely keep from laughing. \"There\u0027s a service tunnel from an old funeral parlor to the mental hospital?!!!?\" Are you kidding me? This would hilarious/genius if it was MEANT TO BE A JOKE. It only gets worse from there. Seriously. I promise. It wasn\u0027t even funny in that great Cabin Fever way. It was just terrible.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
