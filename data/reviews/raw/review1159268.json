Here, he explores how one\u0027s feelings can affect it: the life of the writer reflects directly on his view of his son and the wife of this one, and their respective (supposed) lovers, which actually are a representation of the writer\u0027s alienation, guilt and self-depreciation. It shows how memory can be more painful than any pain of the flesh, and even worse than reality itself. Like everything i\u0027ve seen from Resnais so far (Night and Fog, Hiroshima Mon Amour, Mon Oncle D\u0027Am√©rique and one of my favorite films, Last Year in Marienbad), this one is a very deep and original masterpiece.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
