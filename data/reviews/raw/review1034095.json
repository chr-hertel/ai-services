This was one of the most wonderful movies I\u0027ve seen in a very long time. Mr. Perry is bringing quality movies and taste back into our theaters. This movie portrays that we can go through a struggle and come back strong with help and guidance from our Savior. I would like for Mr. Perry to bring a show to regular TV, but I truly understand were some of our principles cannot be compromised. All brothers aren\u0027t bad and those that have flaws there is always room for change. Hallelujah, for bringing back the dignity and positive portrayal of our young black men. For our women, this movie\u0027s strong statement says that if we fall we can get back up. I was told that the house that Helen (one of the characters) lived in was Tyler Perry\u0027s real house. What a gorgeous piece of work. Everyone please go out and support such a wonderful work of art. Remember, we need this type of positive role models for our younger generation. Again Mr. Perry keep up the good work and may God continue to bless the positive ministry, you are instilling in our theaters." }
