I read his books (\"The Ashes of Eden\" was a great one) and listen to his CD \"Has Been\". But \"Groom Lake\", or \"The Vistior\" like it is called on the DVD i bought, is low average. On the DVD-Cover are Pictures of The Enterprise D - and this Movie has nothing to do with Star Trek! And the Photos on the Backside are from a other movie with Bill - \"American Psycho 2\"! This is kind of weird, and, well, a bit a shame for a great actor like Bill Shatner. He don\u0027t need such crappy tricks to sell DVDs!\n\nThe film itself is a B-movie, and if you like Sci-Fi-Movie, you maybe like this one. Yes, the story is a bit confusing and not really straight told. Yes, some of the effects show the low budget of \"Groom Lake\". But it has it\u0027s moments, and if you like Sci-Fi, you maybe like it. The only thing i really don\u0027t like are the shaky hand-camera-scenes.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
