She is a wonderful actress, on-stage as well as on the screen. We have few chances to see her, though. I think that\u0027s especially true in the United States.\n\nHere she plays a sympathetic role. Not only that but she is also very pretty and meant to be something of a bombshell.\n\nWalter Pigeon does not hold up the tradition of Drummond performers. He is always reliable but he\u0027s not much fun. He\u0027s not a rascal or a knave. Consequently, this seemed to me a talky endeavor with little action or suspense. But check it out for Leighton.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
