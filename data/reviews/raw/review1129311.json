In this episode, Jamie and Adam put some shark tales to the test to find out what\u0027s fact and what\u0027s fiction. Can you defend yourself by punching a shark? Can a shark punch through a boat? Can a shark break through a metal cage? Willing shooting a tank of compressed air (that\u0027s in a shark\u0027s mouth) explode a shark\u0027s head? Can a shark tow a boat? You\u0027ll never know if you miss this! If you\u0027re a fan of shark week, then you don\u0027t want to miss this. It\u0027s worth tuning in for just to see the hosts looking terrified, underwater, and surrounded by sharks.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
