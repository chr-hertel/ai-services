Instead, its one of the best Tactical Strategy games I\u0027ve ever played.\n\nIts deceptively simple. All you really need to know are these four things:\n\nIf you are behind cover, you won\u0027t get shot. If they are behind cover, they won\u0027t get shot. If you flank them, such that there is no cover between you and them, they will get shot. If they have an RPG (Rocket Propelled Grenade), cover doesn\u0027t matter.\n\nIts a slow game, I\u0027ll give it that. You have to move from cover to cover and outflank the enemy, and some of the missions can take quite a long time, especially near the end. Other times, it takes several minutes to go down an empty street simply because you have no idea when a baddie is going to show up.\n\nSo, yes, the pace is rather methodic, and you can\u0027t shoot the gun yourself. But its a strategy game, so those hits are pretty much standard for the entire bleeding genre. But once you get into it, when you start looking around and seeing exactly what you need to do, that\u0027s when you really get how good it is.\n\nAlso, it really feels authentic. The strategies make a lot of sense, and since this was commissioned by the US army (well, a separate version, which is more detailed and difficult), it makes sense that this would use modern strategies. \n\nBasically, give it a chance, because its worth it, especially if you are a strategy nut.\n\nYou should rent it though. If you don\u0027t like it, then you aren\u0027t down thirty-forty bucks, and if you do like it, you\u0027ll burn through it relatively quickly, and there really isn\u0027t a huge replay value. It took me about three days to finish the campaign, and its unlikely that the downloadable missions will take much longer.\n\n4/5 (5/5 for the strategy nuts)" }
