Obviously, from the comments on this thread, there are lots of people who find this dreck entertaining, but it is hard to fathom.\n\nSadism, racism, profanity, vulgarity, even bodily function jokes...yes, all the stuff that drunk or chemically-influenced college boys might find amusing...they\u0027re all here in profusion. About the only redeeming factors in this movie are the 30s music tracks, the clever animation, and the references to 30s films and musicians.\n\nThis film is an example of what happens when an inbred group makes a movie without any accountability or quality control. Avoid it at all costs. (Trivia bit: this is Danny Elfman\u0027s first score, and even here he is using Steve Bartek to help with his arrangements. Bartek did orchestration duty on many of Elfman\u0027s later \"legit\" scores.)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
