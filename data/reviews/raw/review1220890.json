Was fantastic to see more the the sadistic Jigsaw, Tobin Bell really made the role his own! I can\u0027t wait for Saw 3! This is probably one of the best sequels i\u0027ve seen, they way it incorporated the original into the movie is brilliant! Rise n Shine everyone....There was enough blood to satisfy even the most hardcore terror/horror film fan! One particular scene left me almost crying in fear and anguish due to it\u0027s horrific nature! here\u0027s a hint...it involves Amanda and her sordid past!\n\nRise n Shine people...Jigsaw wants to play a game!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
