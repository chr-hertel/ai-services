After all, it\u0027s well acted, well directed, and deals with some heavyweight, complex social and ethical issues.\n\nProblem is... is that what you really wanted to see? A drama? A deadpan, straight-faced, humourless, mostly action-free drama? \n\nI like dramas... I really do. Some of my favourite movies fall under the drama umbrella - Shawshank, Shine, Goodwill Hunting, Once were warriors, American History X, The Assassination of Jesse James, Ondskan...\n\nBut lets be honest with ourselves shall we? We\u0027re sitting in the theatre watching a movie about a billionaire vigilante in a caped bat costume fighting a green-haired clown. How much drama/realism can you truly inject into that mix before you lose any and all sense of good entertainment? \n\nSadly, not this much. And I\u0027m at a complete loss as to how this movie got such a high IMDb rating (9.4 at the time of writing). The only thing I can speculate is that an entire new generation of over-enthusiastic, and apparently very easily-pleased, youngsters just reached movie-going age and skewed the results.
