It\u0027s zany like Malcom in the Middle with a \"Brady Bunch\" format. This show presents itself as a family drama and a comedy at the same time. It brings forth family crisis and conflicts that could easily happen with any family and adds a strong touch of humor. In the word of the immortal Howard Cosell, \"it tells it like it is.\" Well directed, with a strong cast, this show is one of the best that Disney has aired. Daniel Magder (Edwin) and Jordan Todosay (Lizzie) are cast as the \"unsung heroes\" and they pull it off effortlessly. I\u0027m really looking forward to season two!" }
