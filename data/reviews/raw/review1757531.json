But the real clue in this movie is Linda Fiorentino\u0027s portrait as Bridget. She manipulates her young lover, dominates her husband, \"control\" with her sardonic laugh and her long, sexy legs the situation, she is the ultimate, intelligent, evil bitch among with Barbara Stanwyck in \"Double Indemnity\" and Kathleen Turner in \"Body Heat\" (after this performance Turner looks like Snow White!). For her standout acting she deserved an Academy Award (she wasn\u0027t nominee because the film was released for local cable and not for the theaters). Probably one of the most sexy and elegant female roles / performances ever", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
