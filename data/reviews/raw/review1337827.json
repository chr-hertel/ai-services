My best friend\u0027s mother bought three copies of it, one for her and one for each of her daughters, so I watched it over there. And in all technicality, even though I love the music, I LOVED the brass section more! They are so entertaining! They danced, and played their instruments, and sang away from the mic\u0027s more often than not, but danced and kept the audience entertained...when they noticed. They were pretty much all I watched when they were on screen. :) IT WAS GREAT! And I\u0027ve seen the cut and uncut versions, so I know what the full concert looked like, and it was GREAT!!!! WHEEEE!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
