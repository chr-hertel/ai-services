This is the definitive Batman movie because It actually explore Batman\u0027s Origins and went a lot deeper than other previous films have attempted. This had a much grittier, darker and realistic feel which I thoroughly enjoyed the way the material was handled with great respect and care and to try and make it all realistic??? excellent approach!!!! I thought all the actors were wonderful, Liam Neeson as Ducard/ Raz, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon, Michael Caine as Alfred, and Christian Bale as The Bat. Michael Caines one liners were just hilarious. I thought katie holmes did well in this film, The Tumbler was awesome, and the way Batmans voice sounded when he was in the mask, awesome! Especially when he shouted \"Rachel!\" that was beautiful. I thought it was a bit sad when they broke up but then again, Batman was destined for a greater Love, which resides in Catwoman. I especially loved it when Bruce told off all the rich phonies! Ha! Awesome! It was just an awesome movie all around and is one of the best Movies of the Year!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
