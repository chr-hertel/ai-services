She answers, \"hope.\" I don\u0027t think that even she realizes at this point the true reason for her decision to become a courier, but she recognizes this fact after suffering through guilt and anguish over the choices she\u0027s made that impact tragically on the lives around her. Charlotte is a young woman whose future is being shaped by war and evil. She wants to be brave and go forward with the hope that her future will be good, but she is not happy to be passive, she wants to fight for it the only way she can. Also, Charlotte gives hope to the two little boys when she risks her life to write and deliver the letter \"from Mama and Papa.\" I think, too, her decision to return to France and seek out Julien demonstrates that Charlotte has learned that life just happens; it cannot always be planned out neatly. While Charlotte thought that the hopes and dreams of her future depended on a life with Peter, she learned that her life was actually unraveling around her while she strove to play out the one and only agenda she could see at the time.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
