That educates and shows who people become thru culture. And we all feel good after a sweet performance from Scarlett Johansson.", "reviewBody": "\"The Nanny Diaries\" certainly has to be a feel good summer movie, it\u0027s entertaining and sweet and a coming of age story as told thru one characters point of view. The ever beautiful and attractive Scarlett Johansson stars as Annie Braddock a suburban New Jersey girl who just graduates college and she has dreams of becoming an anthropologist. Yet beyond that much isn\u0027t clear so Annie moves to New York City to take a job as a nanny and first she feels freedom! Only to soon have reality crash in once she\u0027s hired by a Manhattan socialite and sophisticated classy upper east side narcissist called Mrs. X(Laura Linney) who does nothing, but shop and eat out all day and attend glamour events. So it now falls on Annie to look after five year old Grayer(Nicholas Art) and it\u0027s very tough as to Mrs. X Annie never does anything right. Also Mr. X isn\u0027t much better played okay by Paul Giamatti who really is nothing more than a successful business man who\u0027s hooked on any attractive female in a skirt and short shorts. Yet all along the way attachment and friendship is developed between Annie and Grayer a real coming of age story for Annie to see this society in an anthropological way and learn from it and come of age. As in the end Annie convinces Mrs. X to be a loving mom and Annie sees her real passion is grad school not a nanny. Really a touching comedy that educates showing people have to learn thru experience and culture what life is right for them and that dealing with different cultures is a loving and life remembering experience. Scarlett Johansson gives a very sweet and people pleasing performance that she just glows on the screen making this a sleeper hit comedy.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
