I never read the best-seller but still found the plot to be compelling.\n\nChiyo and her sister are sold to 2 separate geisha houses to be trained to enter that way of life. In Chiyo\u0027s she almost immediately runs afoul of Hatsumomo, who is already a geisha. Hatsumomo is jealous of Chiyo\u0027s potential as a geisha and they have a life-long rivalry.\n\nBecause of Hatsumomo\u0027s conniving and her own attempts to reunite with her sister by running away, Chiyo becomes the slave of the woman running her geisha house. She almost give up hope, but the kindness of \"the Chairman\", who buys her flavored ice and gives her some money, revives her spirit and Chiyo vows she will someday be a geisha.\n\nWhen Chiyo is trained as a geisha her name is changed to Sayuri, and she immediately attracts the attention of many men, but she longs only for the Chairman. Her rivalry with Hatsumomo continues, as Hatsumomo and Sayuri\u0027s patron both want their protégé\u0027s to be \"adopted\" by the woman running the geisha house.\n\nAt film\u0027s end, Japan\u0027s loss in WW II changes everything. Geisha\u0027s become westernized and some are more prostitute than geisha. Sayuri, however, retains hope that someday she might be reunited with \"the Chairman\" and fall in love.\n\nI think this film has an excellent chance to be nominated for some of the more technical awards - cinematography, make-up, score and others - at the Oscar\u0027s. The woman playing Sayuri, Zhi Zyang (?), was nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Actress and she too could be nominated for an Academy Award", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
