So on their listings of previous episodes, there was one devoted to propaganda shorts encouraging participation in the armed forces of World War II. One of those was a nearly 2-minute musical short cartoon from Leon Schlesinger called Any Bonds Today? that had Bugs Bunny singing the title song recently written by Irving Berlin \"asking you to buy your share of freedom today-y-y-y\". The wabbit also briefly changes into Jolson with black-face before being joined by Elmer and Porky for the finale. As directed by Bob Clampett, this was pretty entertaining and still provides some pleasure at seeing an emerging popular cartoon character displayed in an important Public Service spot for mass audiences at the time. For any offended by the few seconds of burnt cork on Bugs\u0027 face, be aware that this was accepted public humor at the time with no malice whatsoever. So for anyone interested in World War II history or that of Warner Bros. cartoon rarities, I highly recommend Any Bonds Today?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
