This show dramatizes the complexity of how that happens. We might even get some ideas about how to make things better! Insights are good things.... \n\nThere are definite comedic points in the interplay of the ex-cop team leader and the politico head of the project, the team leader and the women.\n\nAt times, the forensic examinations reveal really interesting tidbits that are very clever.\n\nIt is fun to watch this show, and given some more time, the characterizations will get better. Good stuff to be aware of.\n\nEnjoy!" }
