As I am rating it from a child\u0027s point of view and have not seen it since then, keep in mind that as an adult, the enjoyment may have run out. I thought that it was a fun film, and it seems to be well-received by a wider audience too, based on other reviews and remakes/sequels. I also have seen at least four cars over here in England that look like Herbie and have various \u0027HERBIE\u0027 personalised licence plates and markings. It\u0027s a fun film (for children, anyway), and the old VW is pretty cool.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
