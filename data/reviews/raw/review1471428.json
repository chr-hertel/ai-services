They combine their talents to bring the story of a man who poses as a knight to compete in jousting tournaments. When you add a dose of jealousy, humor and romance \"A Knight\u0027s Tale\" becomes one of most interesting and intriguing films this year.\n\nFollowing his breakthrough role in \"The Patriot,\" Heath Ledger continued to amaze audiences with his command performance in \"A Knight\u0027s Tale.\" Ledger\u0027s role in this film deserves to be recognized with an academy award. With less than 10 films on his resume prior to the film; Ledger is a young veteran who combined his charisma, character, intelligence, integrity and intensity to create one of the best atmospheres in \"A Knight\u0027s Tale.\" Addy has come a long way since performances in \"The Full Mounty,\" \"Jack Frost\" and most recently \"Down To Earth.\" These films all have one thing in common: Addy\u0027s tremendous talent. Addy has brought credibility to each role he has played; however, with \"A Knight\u0027s Tale\" has been his best performance to date. Addy\u0027s breakout role may have been in \"The Full Mounty\" but it is with \"A Knight\u0027s Tale\" he has arisen as a true star.\n\nSewell\u0027s performance as the villainous Count Adhemar made me sit up and take notice of the actor because he played the role to perfection. Sewell\u0027s villainous role is the best since Will Patton\u0027s performance as Gen. Bethlehem in \"The Postman.\" Unfortunately, this is the only Rufus Sewell film I\u0027ve seen but now I have reason to rent his movies.\n\n\"A Knight\u0027s Tale\" contains excellent support from Sossamon, Fraser, Bettany and Purefoy. Sossamon along with Fraser are bright young actresses whose roles make \"A Knight\u0027s Tale\" a box office hit; while Bettany and Purefoy have tremendous screen presence. Watching these actors perform in supporting roles, gave me reason to smile because it was like the completion of a 2000 piece puzzle.\n\nWith similarities to \"Gladiator,\" this film has far surpassed my expectations. The writer\u0027s took \"A Knight\u0027s Tale\" a step further with the creation of a love triangle, humor and professional jealousy. I commend the writer\u0027s approach to these areas as they made it enjoyable from start to finish. I was impressed with addition of humor and music which included songs such as \u0027We Will Rock You.\u0027" }
