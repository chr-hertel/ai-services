The Hell itself is good place to draw a beautiful painting. The few action scenes are acceptable. Lightening and Photography is surprisingly nice and Francis Lawrence has the promise of an intelligent director with perfect sense of scene creating. The Fall of the twin Dodson both in hell and in the rooftop is visually crazy. John\u0027s pursuit of devil-son is perfect special effects scene.\n\nThe performance in Constantine is standard, with an exceptional work from Rachel Weisz, Tilda Swinton, and Peter Stormare. Choosing Peter Stormare as Satan is perfect. unlike dragonic or demonic figures of Satan shown in other movies, this time we have a the body of a normal but extremely ugly and disgusting person who has all unmoral and devilish features of mankind.\n\nConstantin\u0027s philosophy can be viewed from different religious aspects. Muslims do not believe in angels free will as other religion do. That matter and free will itself (wether human or not) are the subject here. If you believe in this movie\u0027s philosophy you have to believe in Gabriels choice. But if Gabriel really believes in that way of redemption. Why she shoes so much interest in John\u0027s redemption(Which is in her happiness for his moral ascension in the end).\n\n\"The Road to Salvation Begins here tonight\". Before Gabriel tells this to Constantine she smiles to John\u0027s anger. There is kindness in her eyes, tone, and aura. Her Breath and blow throws john away. The way she does it is kind but to John its painful (He crashes into the wall).\n\nI really had to write the part above because it meant something more than the film it self. The way Tilda Swinton acts as Gabriel (especial;y in this scene) is rare performance. She uses her innocence ,charisma ,and facial reactions to tell a fact. Whether acceptable or not, it is striking and mind using. \n\nJohn has a chance of going to heaven but Devil brings him back here. After his return he hits Gabriel but doesn\u0027t try kill her and on the rooftop he tells us about his new way of believing and understanding and finally he brings a gum instead of a cigarette out of his pocket and starts chewing it. For him and us chewing a simple gum can be redemption and all those heroic efforts(such as exorcism)can be damnation.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
