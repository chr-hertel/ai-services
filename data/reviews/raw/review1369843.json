As horror movies go it has the suspense and the gore, not to mention the hot girls (cop in leather jeans yes please!) the beginning, however, I felt was very slow to start and I have to say the acting was pretty lame. Sean Bean is used to minimum effect and the exchanges between Rose and the cop are pretty forced. Some of the CGI is pretty damn dodgy, particularly in the opening scenes although it does improve as the movie goes on. It\u0027s worth a look, but only if you\u0027re a fan of horror movies, or of course the game. Although it does improve as the movie goes on, you are very aware of the time passing and there are some moments that are just pretty damn ridiculous, all in all not the best film I\u0027ve seen in a while.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
