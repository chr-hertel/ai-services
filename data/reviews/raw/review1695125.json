This film was a horrendous mess. Horrendous. I can\u0027t even begin to explain how the time travel aspects were brushed over, and how the special effects took prescience over what should truly matter in a film such as this - The plot.\n\nHow dare they pretend that someone could tamper with something as sensitive as \"Time\", and have an absolute disrespect for the physics of the nature.\n\nTake a serious moment out of your day, and walk/drive to your local Blockbuster (hell; get it online) and rent the film \"Primer\". Best film I\u0027ve seen in 10 years, done for 1/100 the budget, and had the wherewithal to stand the test of time.\n\nOverall rating: 3/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
