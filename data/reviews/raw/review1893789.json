Unlike the spoiled \"stars,\" who went to work acting in order to gain fame and fortune, who stomped off sets in fits of temper or while having childish tantrums, it is refreshing to learn from this biopic that Miss Davis could leave people with whom she worked and friends she knew well alike rolling on the floor laughing. When she goofed on the set, instead of bickering, instead of being an ego-maniacal shrew, Davis came up with hilarious one liners when she missed hers, like, \"I\u0027ve just given birth in the ladies room,\" (in response to her co-character\u0027s line, \"What\u0027s so serious?\"--the film crew can be heard cracking up in the background, while Davis herself is grinning ear to ear). That\u0027s one of my favorite aspects of Bette Davis\u0027 whole personality: how she could so easily deploy humor to ease others--even during the worst years of WWII.\n\nTo learn how bold \u0026 brave a 25yo woman was to stand up to Warner Brothers in pursuit of nothing more than good scripts reveals so much about Bette Davis\u0027 life dream. Davis doesn\u0027t leave her dream to our imagination. She tells Dick Cavett in 1971 that she was determined to be the best actress or quit. To imagine that a five foot two, eyes of turquoise blue woman could take on heavy socially controversial topics through the delivery of some of the finest scripts is daunting. Tiny as she was her shadow is towering today.\n\nThe only comparable biopic about US Cinema\u0027s First Lady is \"All About Bette,\" brilliantly narrated by Jodie Foster: it\u0027s a bit more intimate and concise.\n\nDon\u0027t stop here with this biopic: view them all in order to develop the fullest bodied vision of one heck of a woman. There\u0027s much more to her life than what meets the eye through her 100+ corpus of fabulous films. Indeed, Davis\u0027 contributions to humanity are yet to be sung." }
