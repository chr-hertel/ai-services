So many nods to classic horror films, so many cheap sight gags, so many gay jokes. This little independent film from the UK manages to be better than all 4 \"Scary Movie\" films combined and then some. It was a real treat indeed. The humor is hardly brilliant or mature, yet the film is just so damn fun. And you WILL find yourself laughing out loud quite a few times. Kudos to Chistian James, Dan Palmer, and everyone else involved in this insane hilarity.\n\nMy Grade: B+", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
