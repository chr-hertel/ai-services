Probably a good thing or the gags that come fast and furious would be too much over the film\u0027s running time.\n\nOnce again, MARGARET DUMONT is the butt of Groucho\u0027s most outrageous observations as he proposes to make her the patron of the arts for the opera house. She takes all of his humor in good stride (as always), making the perfect \"straight man\" for his jokes. HARPO and CHICO get plenty of opportunity to shine in a number of slapstick behind-the-scenes moments. The famous stateroom scene and the \"party of the first part\" routine are the funniest highlights. WALTER KING demonstrates comic skill in a good supporting role.\n\nAs for Carlisle and Jones, they get a chance to show their vocal skills although tenor Jones is still a bit stiff as an actor. As usual, the romantic interest is just a filler between the Marx Bros. routines.\n\nSumming up: Margaret Dumont\u0027s exasperated patron of the arts is one of her funniest roles--and the film is one of the best for the brothers, a good mixture of music and their brand of slapstick fun.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
