The ending made me", "reviewBody": "want to get ill on apple cider. The movie itself is pleasantly entertaining, but the ending! Gak! Bette Davis gives it all up for Bob Montgomery! Why? He\u0027s sexy, yes, but where\u0027s he been for three years and what is he offering her? It was depressing to see her standing there nodding while holding the suitcases. It\u0027s the chauvinistic Production Code in full force. I think Mick LaSalle in Complicated Women described actress Kay Francis playing a scene that called for giving up one\u0027s career for a man as a \"soul death.\" How right! In a pre-Code, Davis would have simply said, \"Well, look me up when you\u0027re next in town and we\u0027ll hit the hay. Meanwhile, I have a magazine to edit!\" (By the way, was anyone else as horrified as me to see Norma Shearer throw over suave Montgomery for dorkus supreme Neil Hamilton (the Comissioner from TV\u0027s Batman series, for cripes sake) in \"Strangers May Kiss\"? That aside though, a cute little film with lots of comedy with Davis and Montgomery interacting with the small-town Indiana family whose wedding they have come to cover for a women\u0027s magazine. The old man and his outdoor cider jug and Mary Wickes are among the highlights. Watch if you can ignore the silly ending.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
