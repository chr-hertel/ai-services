Not even good enough to make Xena or Hercules! Actually the acting isn\u0027t much better. All the characters are annoying, especially the good guys. Ex: The \"dwarf\". He\u0027s just as tall as everyone else, and has a red nylon beard. Why?\n\nThe plot is awful! Aparantly the script was written overnight, while the writers were looking at the two words: Dungeons and Dragons, and then they came up with this... Sometimes it just doesn\u0027t make any sense. Oh, I love the way the heroes help the queen to become the supreme ruler of the Empire, by crushing the council, giving her absolute power, all in the name of Freedom! Why?\n\nThey should make a law, that anyone who would like to be a Hollywood producer, should watch this movie, as an example of how not to do it! I guess it is a funny movie, if you just want something to trash, but that is also the only thing its good for." }
