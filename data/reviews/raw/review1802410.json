From personal experience I understand, and I know how hard it is to promote a film in this world. Don\u0027t I dare to ask myself, what would be the right way to promote a film like 4,3,2. After several months from the film\u0027s release, I finally got the chance to see the it. Once again, I would like to take down my hat in Mr. Mungiu\u0027s front, for the wonderful work he\u0027s done. The Mexican Trio, the self made kings of Realism in modern film, that perhaps had ruled the silver screen for the last few years, can now step back and let the throne to Mungiu. His film makes Babel, Children of Men, or any other film that deals with real fact, looking like a commercial for pop-corns. With all my respect and gratitude from a film Director to another, even though I find myself on the quest for something else completely: Thank you! This is a \"Must See\" opera that will bring any serious filmmaker to a huge dilemma: What should we look for next?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
