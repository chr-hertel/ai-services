VANISHING SON, BANDIT (a spin-off of SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT) and THE MIDNIGHT RUN films. MIDNIGHT RUN FOR YOUR LIFE was fantastic. Christopher McDonald as the Robert DeNiro tough-guy bounty hunter with a heart was charming, funny, very entertaining. The beautiful Melora Walters (prior to BOOGIE NIGHTS and MAGNOLIA) is sweet as the lovable Lorna. I loved this movie, and luckily was smart enough to video tape it in 1994. I recently dug it out and enjoyed it again. It is a shame they don\u0027t make great movies like this for TV anymore, but it\u0027s great to see Christopher McDonald and Melora Walters still going strong.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
