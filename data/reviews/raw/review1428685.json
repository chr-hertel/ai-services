Simply in terms of acting style alone, it cannot be faulted. According to the writer Sheridan Morley, Edith Evans\u0027 famous interpretation of Lady Bracknell was apparently developed in memory the many grand ladies that had kept her mother\u0027s family in domestic service for many years. One can well believe it. And director Anthony Asquith has not made the fatal error committed in many recent film versions of Wilde\u0027s plays, of \u0027inventing\u0027 extra material to take away their staginess. Their staginess is part of the way the pieces work. Now, all we need is a proper restoration of the Technicolor original and we\u0027ll all be happy.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
