Hardly ever wavering from the tick tick tick pace. Aesthetically beautiful, the director went through great pains to set the stage, and forgot about the actors. Many missed moments that had far greater import than the actors portrayed. Not their fault. The director\u0027s style is obviously on story and scenery. The actors were secondary. \n\nThe WWII significance was all but lost as well. It had far less emotional import than it should have had.\n\nIt seemed like the whole things was shot with one lens.\n\nOverall slightly above average. The story held it together.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
