And I can\u0027t be the only one who doesn\u0027t like this game.\n\nFirst of all, graphics and music are fine, but unless they\u0027re awful, I hardly care about these when I\u0027m playing a game. The scenarios and music get old after 5 minutes, and you have to stay there for like 10 hours.\n\nSome people say no enemies beside Colossus makes this unique, I say it makes it boring and it\u0027s just the result of a lazy/cheap design. Even the Colossus are basically all the same, and really easy to defeat. I can\u0027t think of a way to make this killing Colossus more diverse, but I just believe it\u0027s a bad idea to make a game just about that. Oh wait... is not about that, is about looking for them, yes! For every enemy, you will spend about half hour looking for it, and 3-5 minutes to defeat it. Every part of this quest is plain boring and repetitive.\n\nI\u0027m the kind of guy who gets really fanatic with any game and goes around it multiple times, I can\u0027t get enough of video games, I never get bored. I must say I couldn\u0027t finish this game once. It is the only one game I own, I\u0027m not playing and I haven\u0027t finished. And it\u0027s 1/10th time consuming of the average game I play... is that boring.\n\nAnd also, the horse is really stupid.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
