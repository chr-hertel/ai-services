McGinley is very funny in his role.i don\u0027t want to say what that role is,because that would be spoiling things.but trust me,he\u0027s pretty funny.as with the first movie,this one is predictable,so there\u0027s no surprise how it will end.there\u0027s a bit of innuendo here,but no bad language.i\u0027m surprised at the low rating(2.8/10) which in my mind is nowhere near fair.for me,this is a movie that is pretty much good for the whole family.i give Are We Done Yet? a 6/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
