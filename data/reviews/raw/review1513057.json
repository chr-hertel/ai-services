I love how it shows the life and reality for blacks back in the 1920\u0027s. It is well directed and put together. I love the vulnerability of Halle Berry\u0027s character Janie, she is a very strong black woman in search for love, and at times searches in the wrong places, which I believe many women can relate to. It goes way pass the color of your skin. The actors and actresses in this movie are outstanding, Ruby Dee,Terrance Howard, Micheal Ealy and the gorgeous Halle Berry. Together they all have great chemistry and excellent communication. It has all the makings of a great movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
