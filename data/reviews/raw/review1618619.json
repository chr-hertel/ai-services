A brutal and realistic look at the deterioration of the human spirit, this film is unstoppable and amazing. Never in my life as an avid film viewer, has something made me feel the characters pain and terror like in this film. Ameara Lavey stars as Angela Aberdeen (angel of aberdeen), the bulimic stripper, who\u0027s slow and agonizing death, parallels the suicide of Curt Cobaine...Which is explained many times throughout the film, you just need to pay attention. Valentines\u0027 raw footage of Lavey is sometimes humorous, sometimes sad, but always dead on. The special effects team do an incredible job for the gore scenes and the other actor/actresses(especially Hank Skinny)just push the film beyond all limits with the colorful and real jets of vomit that soak your television screen over and over again. After seeing this film for the first time, i was stunned, shocked, and completely amazed. Lucifer Valentine is an amazing director and filmmaker.....Be prepared world...He WILL change the face of true horror and gore forever.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
