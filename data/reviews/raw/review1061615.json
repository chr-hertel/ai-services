Finally, after a year, after watching an old Clint Eastwood movie, I found the name. I remember Patrick McGoohan was the star after watching Escape From Alcatraz. I knew it had something to do with The Village. I actually thought it was The Village at first. This was the most unique program at that time. It was very imaginative and actually made you think. I was 12 at the time and watched it faithfully! I remembered no. 6 and this balloon like thing that seemed to come out of the ground and kill people. I haven\u0027t seen the series since it was aired. I read comments where there were only 17 episodes. I thought there were more. It was my favorite series at that time. I\u0027m hoping sometime that someone will either do a remake or the Sci-Fi channel would show the old series. I\u0027d love to see it again. I\u0027m surprise it hasn\u0027t been redone. Imagine what special effect could do today. I just hope if it is every redone, it isn\u0027t ruined like most remakes are! Anyway, I\u0027d like to thank IMDb for helping me find the name of this series. It\u0027s been bugging me for about a year." }
