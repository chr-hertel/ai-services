But I evidently never got enough of Batman, because I thought it was entertaining, in some of the same ways as that show. There are two parts that stay with me. First, when Denny\u0027s partner has been fatally wounded, and he makes a dramatic speech about how he always stood for the law, and obeying the exact letter of it. Then, he says something like, \"Boy, was I stupid!\" Which is his way of telling Denny to become a vigilante instead, which he does (though the TV Batman kind). Then, there\u0027s the scene where he tries to seduce the villainess into letting him go by kissing her, but she isn\u0027t fooled, because he\u0027s too honest to kiss her convincingly ! This was a great example of \"camp\", that was also \"underplayed\", by both the actor and actress.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
