First and foremost no one in the theater could hear what was going on. Yes, it is a spy movie, but no one sitting in the theater was going to give away any of their secrets. They were so serious about what they were talking about that they didn\u0027t want to tell us and we paid for them to let us in on what was going on. Finally I told them to turn up the volume and then we could almost hear what they were saying to each other. One of my friends that came up to me after the movie, and wished us a Happy New Year, then remarked to us that he didn\u0027t know a bit more after saw the movie than when he first went in, in which my wife quickly agreed with him. He then ask me if I knew what in the world the movie was about. Well, I can say that I did get a general knowledge of what was going on, but I did think that the movie could have been a lot better. If you like a spy movie then you might like this one, but be aware that you only have an outside chance of liking this movie. Some of the people in the movie left before it was even over, and I think they left because the movie just didn\u0027t make any sense and it was just to hard hear and to follow. Matt did a great job as did all the other\u0027s in the movie it was just too poorly shot. Although as I said if you really like Spy movies when believe me this Movie is for you. Let me say to all movie goer\u0027s Have a Good and Movie Going New Year!!!!! Regards, HK", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
