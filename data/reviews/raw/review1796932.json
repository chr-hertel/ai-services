The one about how you can\u0027t look away? This movie isn\u0027t that good. The only reason you\u0027re still there is because you brought your kids and you can\u0027t leave them alone in the theater. You might catch a nap.\n\nTim Hill should never work in film again after delivering this awful piece of junk. He manages to take a decent comic actor in Jason Lee and turn him into a robotic, unsure actor in this production.\n\nI didn\u0027t have much hope for this movie in the first place, I admit. If it weren\u0027t basically the only family film I could take my son to around Christmas, my wife and I wouldn\u0027t have gone. God, I wish we could go back in time and stop ourselves. I leaned over to my wife about 10 minutes in to tell her what a stinker I thought it was, but she beat me to the punch.\n\nI\u0027m not kidding. It\u0027s putrid. Only David Cross\u0027s terrific-as-usual work saves this review from being only 1 star.\n\nThe story is cloying, insulting and stupid, as might be expected for a movie in this genre (although the recent \"Curious George\" was blissfully intelligent and enjoyable). The acting is mostly poor. The decision to \"update\" the Chipmunks songs for today\u0027s audience was inadvisable at best and boneheaded at worst. It does not work.\n\nThe chipmunks of old were clever, mischievous and sly. These chipmunks are dumb, somewhat mean-spirited, obnoxious, and in a surprise, needy to the point of uselessness.\n\nEither as a retrospect, a tribute, or as a completely new production, this film totally fails. The final straw? My son couldn\u0027t wait to leave. Spend your money renting Curious George instead.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
