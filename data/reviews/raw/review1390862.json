I\u0027d say that this is probably one of the best animations from big production companies alongside with Ice Age, Shrek, Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo. They\u0027ve done a great job animating those animals. The characters are all adorable (very true to like fur and thorns + extremely big blue and emotional eyes). Movie gives a lot of true laughs. Little ones giggled over the cinema. This movie also teaches what truly matters in this life. I also noticed that children liked the musical score. Some of them started to clap their hands silently and hopped on their seats. And I truly liked the voiceovers. Very well and wisely chosen cast. Outstanding performances from Bruce Willis (RJ) and Steve Carell (Hammy). Overall rating - 9/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
