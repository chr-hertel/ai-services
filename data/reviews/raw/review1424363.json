I know people exactly like these in real life!! It is also educational as it shows in detail what the plus and negatives sides are of cannabis use. Thankfully, they are more positive than negative, and it is alcohol which is shown as the real demon here which is true in life. The only bad thing about this show was the marketing which was crap, as hardly anybody heard about this fab show while it was on TV. Waste no time therefore and go and buy the 1st series DVD, and I really do hope, and so do my mates, that they will all get together again and make a new series. After all, isn\u0027t that why there is a mysterious postcard inside the DVD, which has nothing to do with the first series.......", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
