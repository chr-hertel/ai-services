I watched it last night and cannot believe that it passed me by for nigh on 9 years.\n\nFrom the outset I was belly laughing at it. The plot was completely surreal and I was amazed that the whole story of Harold was lapped up and accepted by people.\n\nThis is one indie movie that needs to be bigger. Trainspotting was the benchmark for how a British movie should be made, but this one moved the bar. It has just completely trashed my \"top 5\" of movies and I cannot fault one part of the film. I just want to sit in front of my TV and watch it again and again.\n\nThe cast was perfect. All characters were realistic, and it was just pure entertainment from start to end. I insist that you see it NOW!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
