Again Japan shows us, that animated movies, doesn\u0027t mean \"child(ish) movies\". Quite the contrary. With it\u0027s very complex story, this one will even leave some adults scratching their head after they see it. That\u0027s because there are many interpretations for this movie. Which make it a somewhat difficult experience.\n\nStill a good one, but difficult to wrap your mind around it ... The story mind you, never get\u0027s out of hand or get\u0027s out of hand (in the sense, that it does make ... sense, in the end). If you\u0027re ready for a mind trip, this sure will be a great one to take/experience!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
