Not even close to being as graphic as advertised (just watched Friday 13 pt 2, much more graphic). Should have followed Oli to his torture and death (after all, he became the lovable character). When Pax ran over that girl at the end, it was cut too fast that he could have been driving over the typical watermelon cart. How did Paxton know that the stranger from the train was one of the killers when every intimate experience with him was with Josh? Pax also wasn\u0027t the one to see the skull tattoo on the killers arm, only the American killer.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
