Kyle MacLachlan was hardly recognizable since the last thing I saw him in was \"Blue Velvet\" and he was 20 years younger. I had to actually check it out to make sure it was Kyle. This ending surprised me and left me talking to myself. It was not a normal Hollywood ending where the innocent victim was saved in the last two minutes of the show. We are led to believe the black man, although convicted for a fire and murder 8 years earlier, might be innocent, we see he still got the needle. Such a show could backfire, and cause the American justice system a new set of problems to deal with. Not a show I would give a high rating to." }
