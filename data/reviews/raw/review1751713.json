There is not one redeeming quality about it, I kept thinking maybe I should just leave. But it was like a train wreck, I couldn\u0027t stop watching.\n\nThe film was obviously low-budget. Which might have been okay but even an low-budget film needs to reach a critical mass of quality - like being able to understand the actors. Whenever I could understand the actors, I wished that I couldn\u0027t as the dialog was unbelievable.\n\nThe characters were flat. The only two that were developed were Mason and Darren. The others might as well have been cardboard cut-outs for all the impact that they had. Mason and Darren weren\u0027t likable and I didn\u0027t sympathize with anything that they went through.\n\nIn the end, I wish I had thrown a fit and gotten my money back. I could have had twelve tacos with that money.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
