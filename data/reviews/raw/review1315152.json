However, I must correct one point. In the series, Paul Sand played the double bass, not the cello. Also, if a series like this is ever done again (and as a classical musician, I hope it is) then the actors need help in adequately faking the playing of their instruments. That aside, as a classical bassoonist and former double bassist, I LOVED it. I\u0027m surprised this show wasn\u0027t a hit. It was quite funny and was a good ensemble cast. Perhaps it was ahead of its time. But I very much remember the show as I was actually playing the double bass at the time in my high school orchestra (prior to switching to the bassoon). In fact, I studied briefly with a member of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. On a related interesting note, I remember reading in TV Guide where Paul Sand received some basic instruction from one of the bassists in the Philharmonic." }
