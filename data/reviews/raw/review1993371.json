Concept aside, this is a remarkable comedic comeback for Carrey, after the magnificent Michel Gondry art piece \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\", the mediocre but dark thriller \"The Number 23\", and the animated \"Horton Hears a Who!\" There are a lot of jokes in the film, and some of them are put to well use. But Carrey blazes above all else with his humor. He\u0027s still the zany goofy guy we all like, but not as hypercaffienated as \"Ace Ventura\" or that \u0027\u0027truthful\u0027\u0027 lawyer in \"Liar Liar\". Carrey has matured. But he\u0027s still very funny. This film may very well be Carrey\u0027s funniest film since the first \"Ace Ventura\", and that\u0027s saying something.\n\nThe story is somewhat formulaic and predictable. But it\u0027s all good as the jokes and mostly Carrey save the film. Sure, it has a preachy message hidden somewhere in there, but all in all it\u0027s a pretty good message: Say yes to (almost) everything and you\u0027ll have a better life. I couldn\u0027t agree more after seeing this film.\n\nSupporting actors are good here, but the standout is Zooey Deschanel. It\u0027s her innocence and natural charm that makes her appeal to the audience, and it is refreshing.\n\nOverall, it\u0027s a very good comedy that will definitely make you smile, feel better, and inspired when you walk out of the cinema. Definitely a watch, especially in these dark economic times.\n\nEntertainment value: 9/10\n\nOverall: 8/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
