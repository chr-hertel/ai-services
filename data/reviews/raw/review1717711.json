They seem more like delinquents than real gangsters (by today\u0027s standards), while Sheridan and Reagan try to resolve the problems they create involving a wrongly accused case of arson.\n\nRay Enright keeps it all moving rather briskly, but the script--with its focus on the kids rather than the stars--is a disappointment for fans of Sheridan and Reagan.\n\nThe cast includes the usual Warner stock company of contract players, including Bonita Granville, Henry O\u0027Neill, Eduardo Ciannelli, Frankie Thomas and Margaret Hamilton.\n\nSumming up: Routine crime drama interesting only for a glimpse of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan at an early stage of their careers.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
