This is all obvious to anyone who has had an unbiased, detailed education of that dreadful time period. On the surface, Jiang Wen\u0027s film touches on these acts to illuminate what it must have been like for the Chinese to cope with the Japanese \"devils\". But a thorough viewing of the film reveals so many more questions not just about the Chinese and Japanese but about the universal relationship between war and humans. Wen directs this film in a peculiar way. He uses comedy that forces us to laugh at things that we shouldn\u0027t. You find yourself smirking or smiling in moments until you catch yourself and remember that the whole scene in which you were laughing at was where character\u0027s lives were at stake. Most people will read this and not see what is so masterful about this approach. What makes Wen\u0027s quirkiness work is that it illuminates the naivety of human beings while at the same time brings these characters to life, which in the end leaves us trembling with emotion. It is a film that transcends common conceptions about war. A masterpiece.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
