The cast is \u0027all-star\u0027 from a British perspective and generally put to good use. It\u0027s not laugh out loud funny but it is fun. The general idea of bumping off those who\u0027ve upset you in life when you know you\u0027re going to die is a nice one. It got me thinking about my \u0027list\u0027 anyhow! I guess as a Micael Winner film it could be seen as a kind of comedy \u0027Death Wish\u0027!. Oliver Reed is particularly good fun as a world-weary assassin. Chris Rea in the lead role is not at all bad in a down-beat kind of way and it\u0027s a mild surprise that we\u0027ve not seen him in anything else since (at least I haven\u0027t). I don\u0027t think you\u0027d be disappointed if you see this film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
