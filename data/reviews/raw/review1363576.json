As you may well have guessed, the same thing happens all over again, and Phillipe Delambre\u0027s head and arm are swapped with a fly. Isn\u0027t that a funny coincidence, that the same thing happens again to the son of the original guy? What are the chances? The Return of the Fly quite simply doesn\u0027t have the same emotional depth or the same quality of plot at all. The Fly in this film is a giant lumbering idiot that just attacks people for no reason at all. They even add a stupid moment in the film where a man goes through the teleportation pod with a gerbil and comes out with gerbil paws. What\u0027s the point? To use up special effects.\n\nThe direction, plot, and acting are terrible this time around, and it doesn\u0027t have the same feel as the original. It was also a big mistake to make this film in black and white after the original film was done is full colour. Ridiculous.\n\n3/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
