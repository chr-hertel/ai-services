If you know nothing about what happened to Pinochet, you\u0027ll learn a little (but very little) from this movie.\n\nBasically, it\u0027s about \u0027retired\u0027 Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet\u0027s unexpected arrest in England during a vacation. The story covers a brief period of about 2 years.\n\nUnfortunately, there\u0027s not much to tell - or learn from this movie except for a little bit of history and some minor characterization. You don\u0027t really get to know Pinochet much at all. In 1 1/4 hours of storytelling, not a whole lot happens either.\n\nIf you don\u0027t know about about Pinochet\u0027s arrest and are interested in it, this movie can give you some information about it - but you won\u0027t get much else.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
