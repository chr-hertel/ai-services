There was maybe one curse word in the whole movie. I love that with a two year running around we can watch movie\u0027s that are a little more decent than others. We have a DVD Player that cuts out any cursing so it bleeped out only once. I love Tim Allen, he\u0027s so funny to me anyway, I\u0027m not hard to please. I thought that Luther was being a little selfish at the end. I don\u0027t think going on a cruise instead of participating in Christmas traditions was wrong, hey they could have save money. (but who wouldn\u0027t want to be with family \u0026 friends during the Holidays) I thought his neighbors should have respected that, but at the end when his daughter surprises the parents, he should have been a little more excited about his daughter being home for the Holidays. I\u0027m not hard to please when it comes to movies. I can tell the viewer that didn\u0027t like it must have been a man, only men down chick flicks:) I think thats what made it funny, that you don\u0027t see nosy neighbors that care so much to do the extreme things that they did. I hope this post helps someone out. God Bless!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
