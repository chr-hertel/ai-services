The acting is very good. The special effects are fantastic. The lost evilish world of Skull Island is also magnificent. They did a great job taking this film to the next level. The only thing that doesn\u0027t make this movie a 10 is its length, and excessive footage of things that just don\u0027t seem to fit with the story. There are a couple of segments where the film just didn\u0027t need to go. All in all it is a good movie with tremendous special effects, and amazing shots of early 1900\u0027s New York. It will make you laugh and cringe and it will make you say \"Wow!\" It\u0027s a shame Universal go rid of that ride...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
