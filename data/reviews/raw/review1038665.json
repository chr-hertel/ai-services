The movie beautifully captures the nuances and rhythms of life on a Pacific island, showing the depth of village culture today. It weaves in the realities of modern-day life (children getting western education, etc) with an age-old conflict that could have happened in a village five hundred years ago.\n\nThe writer and director, who is from Rotuma weaves in powerful themes to a simple story, such as that of female power and enduring justice, using elements from mythology. Most of the actors and actresses in the film are amateurs and they do a wonderful job of acting this first movie. \n\nI\u0027d highly recommend this film for a glimpse into Rotuma\u0027s people and culture.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
