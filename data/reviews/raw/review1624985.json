It\u0027s always an individual thing when it comes to art. While the film didn\u0027t strike the chords in some hearts, it really did in mine.\n\nIt shows the beauty and power of indie film --- so subtle, so real, so comfy, so touching. It\u0027s the story good enough to show the best of every actor\u0027s performance; it\u0027s the music apt enough to carry me through this emotional trip; it\u0027s the cinematography earthy enough to be my eyes; it\u0027s the editing ringing enough to leave me in thoughts.\n\nI admitted a big shock when I found out Ryan Gosling was exactly the anti-Semitic Jewish who once convulsed my mind in \"The Believer\" years ago. I couldn\u0027t even relate it during the whole watching. And that\u0027s when I was really convinced by his acting. What\u0027s more...he was so cute while dancing stiffly to \"Wanted\" in the party.\n\nQuoting Dan\u0027s theory on history evolution, teacher and student are also in a kind of opposite relationship. It\u0027s always soul-stirring and daring to overcome this opposite and develop a winning friendship.\n\nI always regard my childhood a little bit peculiarly precious since almost all my really good friends were teachers around twenty-five and the most precious one of them is as much a \"big asshole baby\" as Dan. I mean, I really shared my feelings and problems with them and they with me. OK, I was never a happy-to-think-of-nothing-else boy in a perfect family. It\u0027s been getting better now, but the damage was done...\n\nTeaching is always a great work for me. I adore all the good teachers who inspire students. There are \"Dead Poets Society\", \"Hard Ball\", \"Dangerous Minds\", but rarely have I seen a film in which a particular relationship between a teacher and a student was portrayed. This time it got me mesmerized and took me back to those reverberant old days.\n\nI was a student living inside the world of a teacher; I am a 23-year-old man willing to be a teacher. I altered my consciousness between the two characters and felt for them. I\u0027m just as happy to see their readiness to change as I was once sorry to be changed by force.\n\nSome might say this film supports some real \"baseheads\" to continue living in pain with no backbone to change, but...let\u0027s see the fact: in this harsh society, it takes so much courage and determinations to live in agony. We overlook it. We abuse our patience. We pretend to be fine. I tell myself maybe I should respect my own feelings more by delaying my responses while others are waiting for them. I\u0027m sometimes as polite as a freak...I\u0027m just seriously joking.\n\nI wonder what my Dan Dunne is doing right now. He\u0027s got no girlfriend at the moment. He sleeps on a cushion on the ground. He\u0027s a loser to all the school staff but a hero to all his students.\n\nHe inspired my life to the greatest extent. He and all those alike deserve a movie to portray their chickenshit life --- like \"Half Nelson\".", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
