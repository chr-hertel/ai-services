The movie was very entertaining and it was a movie that kids could watch also and laugh. Jim is a man that can play his roles and still have fun-or I am thinking he has fun! :D Anyway....The movie as they say was a barrel of laughs...specially the part where the anchor guy couldn\u0027t speak right-LOL..that part cracked me up. I just think people are to hard on Jim(this is for the comment that I read). Man, life is too sweet to be bashing a person for thinking they suck! There are better things to do than be mean- :( Lighten up people... :D Oh and another thing....I do believe that Jim needs a vacation- :D Work,work,work all the time sucks....", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
