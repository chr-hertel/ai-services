But I have to release my thoughts on this film. It entertains from start to finish, scaring the light out of me. I am a wimp when it comes to horror movies. Usually I don\u0027t see the point in scaring yourself. But usually I never see a film quite like DISTURBIA. I was NOT looking forward to seeing this movie, but I went because a friend wanted to, she hated it. I loved it.\n\nA rather depressed teenager who is quite misfitted \u0026 lonely a year after witnessing his Dad\u0027s death starts spying on his neighbours noticing an incredibly attractive new girl next door \u0026 a serial killer kidnapper as well. Him, his male friend \u0026 the new girl all become close friends \u0026 attempt to solve the murder man\u0027s mystery while his mother becomes the kidnappers target.\n\nI haven\u0027t seen Rear Window, I hear this rips off it. MY OPINION: If it truly does, why care? There are remakes \u0026 take-offs everywhere \u0026 it\u0027s bringing a great olden day tale to a new generation.\n\nShia LaBeaouf is greatly fitted for the lead role, his acting is great \u0026 he really makes you believe. All the characters have little hooks \u0026 characteristics that make them really enjoyable. Good characters \u003d Great movie.\n\nThe storyline is great because it leaves big enough room for the serial killer storyline without ignoring the characters personal lives, feelings, back rounds \u0026 different story lines all together. Sure the end is expected, but not unpleasantly so.\n\nIt has just the right amount of gore, without making you feel sick but still enough for some \u0027squeams\u0027. I love the movie because it\u0027s scary without being graphic, leaves you creeped out, suspensed, thrilled \u0026 yet has very little violence.\n\nThe start was not really fitting to the whole undertone of the movie \u0026 the songs chosen for scenes don\u0027t really fit. So I let it out, there are 2 flaws for an otherwise perfect (in my opinion) movie.\n\nIt manages to be a creepy psychological horror while still maintaining it\u0027s teen dramedy. For anyone who likes films with dream sequences, girls next door, surprise attacks, serial killers, depressed kids, teens solving mysteries \u0026 widows this is a must!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
