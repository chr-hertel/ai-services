Seeing Jen\u0027s butt was nice in the movie,, i thought Vincent Donofrio\u0027s part should have been bigger though. I also thought that John Favreau was a riot in this one,, even funnier than Vince Vaughn , if that\u0027s possible,, i hated the character of Richard i\u0027m sorry the guy was a total fruit. I liked the bowling alley scenes, very surreal. The condo which they share was a unique idea.. he has his \"space\" , and she has hers. I wasn\u0027t all that sad at the way the movie turned out. This is a great comedy, but also tells a very good story, about dating, and what couples go through during the process. I would definitely recommend this to anyone,, just one thing though,, couples should NOT watch this together, as i think it would provoke a big fight..", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
