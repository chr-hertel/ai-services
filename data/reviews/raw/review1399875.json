He\u0027s in trouble because three women in a swimming pool see future crimes. It all sounds preposterous and Spielberg has done nothing to make it any more interesting. In fact Spielberg is so absorbed with special effects that the convoluted and confusing plot seems to have been put on the back burner. With the plot failing to sustain interest and the characters difficult to identify with, the special effects become pretty tedious to watch very quickly. Cruise tries to look intense.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
