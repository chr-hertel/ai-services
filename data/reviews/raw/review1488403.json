If you have not witnessed the original Office, please do yourself a favour and watch it. If you like subtle cringe worthy jokes, and well crafted dialogue...you\u0027ll die laughing. In my mind Ricky Gervais is leading a strong resurgence of smart comedy, not relying on the easy dick and fart jokes. Witness \u0027the dance\u0027, a posh pair of boots, and a motivational speech that will leave you in tears. Also, check out Ricky\u0027s podcast on iTunes, as it is one of the funniest things I have ever heard...you\u0027ll will hear the shaved monkey that is Karl Pilkington on topics ranging from; toe-heads, jellyfish,freaks, how older people don\u0027t eat Twix, and monkey news. Do yourself a favour, listen, watch and laugh.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
