Ghosh spins the complete movie on a spellbinding dialog in a dark dreary house. He creates a suspense with the few characters who are sparse but attention grabbing. The Babhi played by Mouli Ganguli is impressive. Ajay Devgan who has reached a Veteran status is in a stage of his life where he can self direct. Ashwirya Rai as Niru draws more sympathy for her character than praise for her acting. The movie has abrupt ending as if Rituparno ran out of ink in his pen. He has to be commended for his talent in writing and direction. He is one of the few Film Makers who have a vision the likes of Madhur Bhandarkar of \"Satta\" and \"Chandni Bar\" fame, who can hold an audience\u0027s attention without the \"Masala\" ingredients. All said and done Ghosh is no Hrishikesh Mukherjee. The movie is short for a feature film and short on budget." }
