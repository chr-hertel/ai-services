HUH?? Was I having a nightmare or was this dreck actually being broadcast?\n\nThe show\u0027s entire content is made up of promo interviews provided by the studios, along with movie trailers, bad comics, and music videos. Between the cheesy music, the obsolete graphics, Allen as host, his wife(?)as producer, and the aforementioned filler, what\u0027s the budget...about $47.26 an episode?\n\nI somehow stumbled through the entire program and SWEAR that Allen said \"Comin\u0027 up neeeeext\" prior to every commercial break. Wasn\u0027t this guy a comedian at one point in his career? How about some original material, fella?? Anyway, if you want a belly laugh, stay with the show until the end credits and you will be rewarded with a can\u0027t miss REALLY bad edit as the music loop runs out. Maybe Byron does the sound editing as well to save a few more bucks?? \n\nThis really IS syndicated programming at its worst. I\u0027d prefer watching \"Conversation with Fred Lewis\" a 1980\u0027s infomercial for New Generation hair growth shampoo...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
