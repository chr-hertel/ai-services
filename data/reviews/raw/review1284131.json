The most inspirational and moving actor of the 21st century made his public television debut...his name was Monroe Mann, but we would come to know him by another name: The Incredible Acting Author Producer Rock Star Professional Juggler Playboy Businessman.\n\nMonroe was born in Port Chester, New York on November 7th, 1977. At the age of ten he was taken to a doctor due to the fact that he was still wetting his bed. This, and other interesting facts, are all divulged by Monroe live...on CNN...before the entire world.\n\n\"I see Oscars everywhere I look,\" said Mann. \"Every day I practice my Oscar speech in front of the mirror for twenty minutes, so that when I finally receive my Oscar I will know exactly what to say, and how to say it; this will make me look professional and grant me even more roles.\" This was, for me, perhaps the most insightful thing ever said on anything remotely linked to interviews. Simply put, Wolf Blitzer puts Geraldo Rivera, Oprah Winfrey and others to shame. He is a BRILLIANT interviewer...and Monroe Mann is (or, shall I say, \"was\" as he is now a very famous movie star) the perfect unknown candidate.\n\nWho is Monroe, you say? Well, if you\u0027ve been living under a rock for the past three years since his first film came out, he\u0027s the extraordinarily successful rock star, author, businessman/yuppie, script writer, producer and, above all else, actor. Even though he\u0027s only starred in one film - an uncredited bit role in the reviled 2002 film \"Swimfan,\" in which he had a 30-second non-speaking role - he has become the legend he rightfully deserves to be. He\u0027s an amazing talent. I\u0027ve never seen a drooling comatose so perfectly embodied before. But maybe he wasn\u0027t actually acting after all.\n\nMonroe has opened up an actor\u0027s school despite having no knowledge of the industry. He\u0027s also written four books (two published) about acting and his services in the military. He is a brave, brave man...and an inspirational example of how to succeed against all odds in Hollywood. Even if, technically, you aren\u0027t succeeding...the willpower is what counts, right? No? Well, better not tell that to Monroe! GO MONORE! P.S. In 2004 Monroe Mann finally managed to raise fifty more cents towards his next project, \"In the Wake of Identity.\" Let\u0027s all give 1st Lt. Mann (currently serving his country in Iraq) a round of applause. Somebody give this guy an Oscar! Monroe, you are wonderful! I love you! SEE YOU AT THE TOP! ROMP ON BABY!! Don\u0027t get lost in the wake of identity! Now let\u0027s all go WAKE BOARD!!" }
