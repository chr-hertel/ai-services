A lot of people interested in promoting Daniel Johnston\u0027s career (music writers, other bands, MTV) have spent a lot of time and effort trying to convince music fans that he\u0027s not an outsider artist혰a naive folk artist who is also pretty much insane혰but that\u0027s exactly the case. His music is not good in the conventional sense of informed, controlled, intentional and masterful. It is involving because Daniel Johnston is out of his mind and extremely idiosyncratic, but frankly, compared to an authentically talented songwriter like, say, Townes Van Zandt (to use the example of another unhinged singer/songwriter from Texas who was recently the subject of a documentary), Johnston is just an impressively motivated whack job with a small cult of dedicated fans and PR folks. And perhaps the most revealing aspect of this documentary is how so many people, back in the up for grabs era of the burgeoning underground/independent music scene in Austin, were cluelessly searching without a map for the next big thing and latched onto Johnston\u0027s delusional self-grandiosity, buying into it at face value. Musical pretensions aside, this film is actually an absorbing portrait of Johnston and his family and the tribulations they have endured going through life taking care of him. At one point his father was piloting himself and Daniel home in a private passenger plane when his son pulled the keys out of the ignition and threw them out the window and the plane plunged to the ground and crashed, and they both actually survived. Those types of incidents혰like the time Daniel broke into an elderly woman\u0027s apartment and frightened her so badly that she jumped out a window to escape and broke both her legs혰certainly makes for an arresting documentary, just don\u0027t feel obliged to buy into the film\u0027s endlessly laudatory view of Johnston\u0027s musical acumen." }
