Another shot at the toughest genre in film - the Psychological Thriller. The few really good ones make it worth sitting through the many lame ones. Sadly, \"The Night Listener\" is all lameness.\n\nSupposedly based on a true story about a recurring phone conversation with a 14 year old boy that may or may not have existed, director Patrick Stettner (\"The Business of Strangers\") has a nice cast and an bland script to work with. Robin Williams has proved to be very effective in this type of film (\"One Hour Photo\"), Toni Collette (\"Sixth Sense\", \"In Her Shoes\") is one of the best actresses working and the supporting cast of Joe Morton, Bobby Cannavale (\"The Station Agent\") and Rory Culkin (superb in \"Igby Goes Down\") would make most directors envious.\n\nWhere the film fails is the utter lack of story or suspense. Any idiot in Robin Williams\u0027 shoes would have walked away long before he goes off the deep end. Also, Williams\u0027 character is so pathetic throughout the film that we cannot even root for him to wake up and smell the Wisconsin cheese. Collette is very good, but both she and Culkin are underutilized.\n\nChalk it up as another failed attempt at this most difficult and elusive film genre. I am not giving up, just considering this as part of the price to pay for the next great one.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
