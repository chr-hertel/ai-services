The morals of this film are certainly well intended but the film goes over the top on pretty much all levels, which leads to a serious but God awful funny last scene. I enjoyed the performances by Shirley and Grey but wish the material had been toned down just a tad so that you could have taken them a bit more serious. Ralph Bellamy has a couple good scenes and his little dance got a couple laughs. Received an Oscar nomination for Best Score." }
