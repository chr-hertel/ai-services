So many directors tried. So many screenwriters tried. Jon Peters cried and cried. It seemed neverending. The possibility of the Superman franchise being brought back to life seemed less and less likely. It seemed like a lot of major players in Hollywood tried their hand at it. Still none of them could quite come up with the right formula. None of them took the best approach. Until Bryan Singer came in. I am literally astounded at how the people who try to dismiss this film will look for every little flaw they can find, but yet none of them will admit the obvious. It was Bryan Singer who succeeded in successfully resurrecting this great film franchise after almost 20 years which was an undaunting task. Hooray for Singer and looking forward to the next one!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
