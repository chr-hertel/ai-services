Sounds simple ? Well it is in principle but in practice its a different story: you\u0027ll be working your fingers to the bone in attempt to be a gaming rock god and hopefully get that elusive 5 star review ! Music wise there\u0027s selection of songs to please even the most demanding guitar enthusiast . Fast , slow, hard , soft , there are all kind of songs to try out , including jams from the likes of alice in chains,rage against the machine, sting, guns and roses and more .\n\nWhether you like to raaaaaaaaaaaaaawk or not, you\u0027ll enjoys hours of addictive rhythm action with guitar heroes 2. I know i did.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
