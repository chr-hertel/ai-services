As I now live in Miami and the local media are giving this movie huge exposure, it has been more high profile here that in, say, New York or Los Angeles.\n\nI think Michael Mann generally is a great director yet, in this particular case, he has perhaps strayed too far from the original for his own good. Miami\u0027s colors are vibrant and beautiful yet, everything here, even when it\u0027s sunny, looks a drab green or blue.\n\nEven with a weak plot, it\u0027s very hard to understand the dialog overall, up to almost 50% of the time!!??!! The actors are so \"restrained\" that you end up not feeling anything for them at all.\n\nThe chemistry between Colin Farrell\u0027s character and Gong Li is barely tepid and I was disappointed in both of their performances. Jamie Foxx is better but not by much. The whole movie is too.... depressing I guess would be the best word.\n\nOverall, I would say this is an interesting movie but not fun and the end result is very disappointing.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
