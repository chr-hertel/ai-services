Please grow up.\n\nHere goes a dialog from the movie -\u0027AGAR TUM LADKEE KO IJJAT DOGE TO LADKEE TUMHE APNI IJJAT DEGI\u0027.\n\nPlot is useless, criminals and police alike running after fools. That is it. BHAGAM BHAG.\n\nWell it lived the title, I had to run away from it. :) I switched over to Star Movies and watched Home Alone 2 instead, and had a good laugh.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
