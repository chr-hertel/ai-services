Also might I add that this movie didn\u0027t have any action except for the part when they had to find Cole Hauser\u0027s cigar and it was boring and stupid and shouldn\u0027t get 5 stars just 2 stars is what it should get which is what I gave it. For the Friday The 13th fans out there this is for you Friday The 13th is crappy but it is better then 2F2F also Steven Segal movies are a better choice of movies to watch instead of 2F2F also Pinata: Survival Island is a better movie to watch................ JUST KIDDING!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
