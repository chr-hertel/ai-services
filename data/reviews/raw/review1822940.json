Having been raised a religious person, it never dawned on me, at least in this Bible story, God was more interested in saving the animal world than in salvaging the human race!\n\nIt was apparent that there were plenty of worthy people to save other than Noah\u0027s family, and his future daughter-in-laws. The film\u0027s writers give us fictionalized examples: No one can deny the goodness of Ruth\u0027s mother, or the unnamed peddler. God didn\u0027t want other worthy people aboard despite how easy it would have been to rescue them! But God did save the tarantulas and hissing cockroaches!\n\nI\u0027m not justifying this particular God\u0027s obvious brutality. A theme which clearly runs through the Noah\u0027s Ark story. But it is important for all of us to come to terms with the simple fact: God greatly cherishes ALL of his non-human creation! \n\nOne of my favorite scenes was when a pair of Dodo\u0027s, now long extinct by the hands of selfish and foolish men, waddled up the ark\u0027s ramp! Another treasured moment was when Noah talks his wife out of throwing the tarantulas and hissing cockroaches out the ark\u0027s window, dooming them to extinction! \n\nNoah said essentially, \"everything is interrelated, other creatures depend on them, and what gives you the right to doom any species to extinction?!\" I\u0027m sure this went over most viewers heads, but Noah\u0027s Ark is first, and foremost, about saving God\u0027s creation from extinction! All of it! Not just what is intelligent, pretty, or convenient! This pearl of wisdom is the foundation of the United State\u0027s majestic Endangered Species Act. Something which would make the God of the Old Testament very proud, indeed! \n\nThere are plenty of reasons why this film will make fundamentalists, and other religious folks, very unhappy. But, hopefully, saving God\u0027s creation, in the here, and now, is not one of them!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
