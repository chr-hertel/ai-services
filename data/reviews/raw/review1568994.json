Everyone else in the movie performs well enough without ever excelling, although Ernie Hudson (Soloman) does play the simple minded handyman with a nice degree of innocence and frailty.\n\nThe tension is sustained well throughout, and the direction is effective without trying to be flashy or over-complex.\n\nThis is definitely worth a viewing, it\u0027s a very good thriller. 7/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
