There are some really breathtaking shots, at least if you watch it on a big enough screen.\n\nSecondly the story, while slow paced, is kinda nice and comes in several layers. Sort of a \"feelgood-movie\", even if all of the characters have their problems throughout the movie.\n\nThe acting was pretty good, but especially John Corbett blew me away. No more nice guy like in Sex and the City or the Greek Wedding. Instead he sometimes reminded me of Jeff Bridges in \"The Big Lebowski\". Which in fact is a big compliment, coming from a guy who watched Lebowski for Idontknow how many times.\n\nDefinitely a well-earned eight on my scale!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
