It succeeds admirably. Tim and Dave are two regular guys who find themselves mixed up in a search for a missing heiress. They must find the Delta Pi with the rose-shaped birth mark or lose the prize of 300 million dollars. But what about their new girlfriends? Which will they choose: Money or love? The film isn\u0027t Citizen Cane and doesn\u0027t try to be. It\u0027s full of \"hey we\u0027re in a movie\" jokes and nudity and a soundtrack by a cool band that some how ends up in almost every scene. I also love the fact that when the private eye (the sexy Blake Pickett)tells them who the missing girl\u0027s famous father is they recognize his name: Example \"She\u0027s the daughter of Steven Stratta\" \"The skate board kid?\" \"Yes\" Everyone in the movie knows that this dude is \"the skateboard kid\". Anyways, the film has a neat surfer rock soundtrack and tons of T\u0026A and a lot of clubs that are now closed down.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
