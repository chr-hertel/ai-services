Does that make sense?\n\nAn evil elf of royal blood wants to break the ancient truce that held humans and the other creatures at peace. What other creatures, you ask? Why, the forest Gods, the creatures living under bridges and suspiciously similar to Star Wars aliens, trolls, elves, tooth fairies and goblins!\n\nNow this is a true revelation for me, the perfect recipe for peace: leave everything to the enemy, while you hide in some magic sewer.\n\nThe story is ridiculous, the characters completely not sympathetic and the Peter Parker anguish just doesn\u0027t sit well with a red angry demon.\n\nBottom line: it\u0027s not even good for laughs. It\u0027s an average modern day no brain neo-fantasy film. Yuckie!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
