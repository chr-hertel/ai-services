Go to the \"goofs\" section of this film and take a look at the loooooonnnnnnng list of inconsistencies and blatant errors in the movie. This is the responsibility of the script supervisor. For this movie that was Karen Golden. Now check out any other movie she has supervised (I checked out \"Pearl Harbor). Another huge list. Granted, most people don\u0027t catch most of the \"goofs\" in a movie, but when you consider how much money is spent making a movie it seems a little ridiculous that a person is allowed to let that many errors slip by and then not only gets to keep her job, but is continually hired for new movies! How many jobs in the world allow for such a huge margin of error? Just food for thought." }
