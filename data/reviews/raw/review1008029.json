One of her jobs is walking the dog of Ada, a woman married to a journalist.\n\nOne day, Ada tells her that her father, a recently retired professor, has begun to show signs of dementia, and will wander throughout the city. She offers to pay Cora to shadow him, supposedly unseen, so he won\u0027t get lost. Cora agrees, but to her chagrin on the second day he boards a train and starts travelling through Italy, rather than just wandering the streets of Rome.\n\nThere are some subplots, involving Cora\u0027s brother, Ada\u0027s husband\u0027s infidelity, and Cora\u0027s depression, which seem more or less random since they are not fully developed nor resolved.\n\nThe film is well acted, and while there are some very nice scenes, some of which are quite poignant, it really doesn\u0027t add up to a compelling story. The ending suggests that the writer couldn\u0027t figure out where to go, so he created something somewhat artificial that really doesn\u0027t answer the questions which are raised along the way.\n\nIt\u0027s watchable, but I wouldn\u0027t go out of my way to see it. Despite the lovely scenery and fine acting, I\u0027d only give it 6 out of 10.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
