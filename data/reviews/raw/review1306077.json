WHERE THE TRUTH LIES remains in the bits and pieces stage, even while actively watching the film, and one can only suppose that what Egoyan intended was a reconstructed parody of the 1940s/50s film noir, works heavily laden with voluptuous femme fatales in plunging satin gowns and suave and dangerous slick-haired male tropes who just happen to be involved in a murder. Oddly the film succeeds on some levels while crashing and burning on others.\n\nLanny (Kevin Bacon) and Vince (Colin Firth) are comedy duo who make the 1950s club circuits when they are not staging their annual polio telethon: Lanny is the love-em-and-leave-em ladies man and Vince is the somewhat uptight straight man who has a controlling nature. The two are involved peripherally with organized crime. All goes well until a nude female body is discovered in their hotel suite bathtub, both men having airtight alibis which proclaim their innocence (though they have had a m√©nage a trois with the young college reporter victim the night before), but the duo split at that point for some dubious reason and haven\u0027t talked since. Jumping 20 years forward we meet an inexperienced reporter Karen O\u0027Connor (Alison Lohman)(who just happened to have appeared on their telethon 20 years ago as a recuperated polio victim and has been a devoted fan of the due since) who has been paid to interview Vince about his life story on the proviso that she obtain information as to why the duo split. Through a series of silly circumstances Karen slowly gains her information and does indeed discover the true murderer and the true reason for the demise of the Lanny/Vince duo - but not without a lot of rangy, edgy sidebars that confuse the story line.\n\nColin Firth and Kevin Bacon are both fine actors and do their best to make the most of this shaky script, but the film is so overly burdened with \u0027atmosphere\u0027, obvious story music, and erratic editing and splicing and piecing that after a while we, the audience simply want the fairly obvious ending to just rush to judgment. If this is a parody and a tongue-in-cheek farce then Egoyan hasn\u0027t mastered that genre. It would seem that once settled into the story, knowing that it is nothing deep or particularly thrilling as a crime buster, there is enough here to entertain, but it takes a bit a patience with the trappings.
