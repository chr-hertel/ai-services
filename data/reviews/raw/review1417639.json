It took me five minutes to get what just happened in my head. I will not contain spoilers since I don\u0027t like to give them away but I have heard when number 3 will be coming out. It will be released on May 25, 2007! I have heard this from a manager at a cinema who I know very well. I do think there are hints in Dead Man\u0027s Chest that will be in End of the World (number 3)! If you wish to know some, just email, and I will tell you what I think. Johnny Depp did an over the top best acting in this film and so did Kiera and Orlando! Out of the two movies, this one beats the first one hands down!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
