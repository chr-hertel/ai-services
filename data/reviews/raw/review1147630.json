When I saw the length of this, I thought I would never be able to stay awake to watch it in its entirety, but that was no problem. Instead, I found that I didn\u0027t want it to end! \n\nSally Field, once again, is a gem. Such talent in that little gal. It seems that she just gets better and better. Also, no matter how old they attempt to make her look, she just doesn\u0027t look old! \n\nI related so much to her character, trying to stay in her daughter\u0027s life, feeling useless as she realized she was getting older, watching those around her die. It was very moving. Wish there was a \"Sam\" in my life.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
