I must say I know it came out almost 10 years ago, it is still amazing. The story was brilliant, the cast amazing, Robin Williams, who won an academy award for this, Matt Damon, who got nominated for this, Ben Affleck, and Minnie Driver, also getting nominated for this. I feel that this movie got robbed big time at the academy awards, but it did have the bad luck of coming out in the same year as titanic, l.a. confidential, and as good as it gets. I just bought this today over at best buy and it was still amazing as the first time i saw it. Loaded with a lot of comic relief. Definalty worth a rental and worth a buy as well.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
