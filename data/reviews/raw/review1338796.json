The reason it had a low grading here is because it isn\u0027t politically popular anymore in Spain. And outside of Spain it is hardly known. \n\nThe attempt made by peers of Franco to instill a sense of brotherhood, courage and pride in the Spanish people is what makes this movie so valuable. It\u0027s very rare at this moment in time to find a movie which expresses these sentiments anymore in a selfless way. BRAVO! To the makers of this movie and to the individual guts of the viewers who takes the time to watch this movie.\n\nIf you get the chance to see this movie, see it. Don\u0027t be bothered by the low cost production or dodgy acting. The spirit of this movie is truly unique!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
