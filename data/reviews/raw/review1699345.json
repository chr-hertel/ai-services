(who wouldn\u0027t? It\u0027s a dream role)... but he DOES come across as a bit stiff at times... can\u0027t tell if that\u0027s the writing or his take on the character. Funny... you can hear his Boston accent come thru a lot... but it adds some charm (assuming you like Boston accents!!) Bruce Campbell is perfectly cast... will be fun to see their partnership evolve over the episodes... Not sure about Anwar as Fiona... can\u0027t decide if it\u0027s the role (and how desperate she seems to be to get back with Michael) or the actress in the role...\n\nI do enjoy the dialog (VERY funny at times - ex: the backseat of the Mercedes)... and the speed of delivery... makes it fun to watch and the time fly... so KUDOS to the writers... \n\nWill say this... I\u0027m probably not in the demographic for their audience (am over 40) but can appreciate that the leads are all older... would NEVER believe that Donovan is 39. No way. He is Miami Spicy.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
