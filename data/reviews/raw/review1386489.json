I was on a first date and there were absolutely no date-worthy movies playing. A bunch of well-dressed students (whom I later guessed to be Moonies)were lined up to see this one. Upon investigation I saw the producers were raffling off a Rolls Royce to all who bought a ticket. \"Ooohh,\" she said. \"Wouldn\u0027t it be fun if we won a car by going to see a movie?\" OK, so I relented.\n\nIn retrospect even if we had won the car it wouldn\u0027t have been worth it. It wasn\u0027t even laughably bad. It was just pathetic, watching Sir Laurence\u0027s career spiraling down the money pit. Just a few short months after watching him flounder in \"The Jazz Singer,\" here he was with an inch of pancake makeup spouting religious homilies.\n\nIt was a time when MacArthur was out of favor and the Cold War was in full swing, so the Reverend Moon was determined to use the latter to rectify the former. I am certainly not an expert on the military history of the Korean War so make no claims as to its historical accuracy. But with the over the top moralizing here I sat there knowing I was being manipulated, brainwashed, whatever.\n\nAnd, on cue, the proselytizing for the Unification Church began as soon as the final credits rolled.\n\nUck, what a sickening experience. I never went out with her again.\n\nFortunately Sir Laurence rebounded shortly after with Clash Of The Titans and a few other not-quite-so-bad performances on made-for-TV movies so we aren\u0027t stuck with this as the last impression of this great actor.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
