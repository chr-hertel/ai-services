This film happened to be about social prejudice directed toward Jewish people in the late forties. However, I made some substitutions, with starling results.\n\nInstead of \"jews\" I first replaced it with the word \"blacks,\" then \"gays.\" While bigotry and discrimination against the African Americans has significantly lessened, it\u0027s the homosexuals who are today\u0027s target.\n\nThe subtle reasons for discrimination covered so well in this film\u0027s script are alive and well in 2009. Many people now use the \"moral\" rationale as opposed to \"civic.\" Still, the results amount to the same: denying American citizens of their human rights because they are gay, lesbian, bisexual and also--in the case of aspects of the current Boy Scouts of America\u0027s charter--atheistic and agnostic.\n\nThe reasons June Havoc\u0027s Jewish secretary stated for supporting her company\u0027s anti-Jewish hiring policy (\"We can\u0027t allow the wrong ones get in here, you know\") are parallel to today\u0027s rationales (\"They might destroy the institution of marriage\" or \"They might molest our children or warp their minds\").\n\nToday, however, the \"gentlemen\u0027s agreement\" regarding \"gay rights\" has fortunately passed the hidden stage, and has been brought into the public forum, which requires voting for or against \"rights\" issues. Thanks to this superbly directed (by Elia Kazan) and acted (by Gregory Peck, Dorothy McGuire, John Garfield, Anne Revere, et al.) film, humanity has progressed toward the day when equality and freedom indeed means all people.\n\nWe are grateful for 1947\u0027s \"Gentlemen\u0027s Agreement\" for helping pave the way for social progress in America. Here\u0027s a case in which the \"entertainment industry\" (much thanks to Darryl F. Zanuck) made a significant contribution toward social change. I do trust that by next year this time (and years to follow) my comments here will be dated and no longer relevant.\n\n_________________________\n\n11/29/2014 Addendum: Today, 5 years after writing the above, I reviewed this film, and it held me mesmerized. What a lean, honest and well-focused cinematic artwork. It is standing the test of time well, and my previous reflections still hold up. Thanks to Laura Z. Hobson\u0027s brilliant novel, Moss Hart\u0027s fine screenplay and Darryl F. Zanuck\u0027s administrative tenacity, Elia Kazan and company produced a superior creation.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
