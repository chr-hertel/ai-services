I mean, to kill toad off in the first movie and barely have him speak was a mistake in itself, and from what I have seen they are not going to even use Blob, a very entertaining character, at all. \n\nI also just feel that I have to mention that those who have not read the comic books, will be missing out on a great amount of compelling characters. In this movie, they seem to have attempted to piece together a lot of characters such as making MasterMind Stryker\u0027s son? It was a very entertaining film but some of the crew\u0027s decisions were pedestrian at best." }
