It was made in 1944 so that puts it right before the Film Noir Era which was a postwar genre and look usually found in crime films until the mid \u002750\u0027s . I find the remarks about Dick Powell not pulling off Philip Marlowe quite tiresome. Raymond Chandler\u0027s Marlowe while very world weary and jaded is completely capable of making mistakes. While I love Bogart, he\u0027s much more suited to the role of the very unlikable Sam Spade. Bogart\u0027s Marlowe always seems invincible and that is a huge departure from Chandler\u0027s books. With Powell, you get a guy who will always try to avoid violence if possible, but if he can\u0027t avoid it, he\u0027s more than willing to smack somebody around. Chandler\u0027s wonderful similes, metaphors and sarcastic humor are a great fit for Powell. As for the positive comments about Mitchum\u0027s turn as Marlowe in the 1970s, I\u0027m mystified. I always thought Mitchum was amazing, but those two films with him are vile. He was wildly too old for the part and the supporting casts were heinously miscast. People need to go back and read Raymond Chandler\u0027s books and they\u0027ll hopefully discover why Dick Powell was Chandler\u0027s favorite Marlowe." }
