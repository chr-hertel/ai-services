Not only do most of them suck, but the films that get remade were fine the way they were. New versions or meditations of old films are seldom necessary for any reason. Except of course that the studios think they will make money on them. But this recent version of Sleuth is something different. Not only is it a pleasure to watch, but I actually liked it a little more than the original. I watched both films this week for the first time ever, so it was easy to compare and contrast.\n\nThe basic plot has stayed the same. A wealthy author (Caine in this version) invites his wife\u0027s young lover (Law) over to his sprawling estate. It is here where the details of the affair are spread out on the table. The author acts as though he wants to be rid of his wife. But he notes that the younger man has not the financial means to keep the woman happy for long. The author proposes that the young man steal some expensive jewels in the house and fence them for enough money to stay away with the woman. After some prodding, the suspicious young man decides to go through with it. But it is quickly clear that the young man has fallen into a trap laced with danger and humiliation. The remainder of the movie deals with the younger man\u0027s attempt at revenge on the rich old schemer.\n\nNothing is really as it seems in this thriller. From the moment we believe the young man was shot dead at the end of the first act, the film becomes a test to see if one man can outwit the other. Thankfully this newer version is much, much shorter. Not so much time is wasted on needless exposition and moving the dialog from one cluttered room to the next. Sure it was great to watch Caine match acting skills with Olivier, but the movie just dragged on too long. Here it is down to a taut 90 minutes or so, and when the conclusion finally comes, it just feels right this time. Caine is a wonderful actor, and it makes me feel older just seeing how much he has aged. Still his performance is excellent. He plays the part of the old man somewhat more reserved and fragile than Olivier did. Olivier was more menacing and perhaps a bit sharper with the dialog, but Caine\u0027s more subdued version of the character worked fine here. I am perhaps one of half a dozen straight American men who likes Jude Law. He\u0027s plucky, edgy, and comes off more dangerous than Caine did in the original. Law matches Caine in the acting department scene to scene. The film\u0027s third act is completely different this time around, and somehow it works. Caine makes the mistake here and there of letting his guard down about a certain personal aspect, and Law pounces on it. The fun and games were definitely over by the film\u0027s final frame, its safe to say.\n\nKenneth Brahagh\u0027s direction doesn\u0027t seem to miss a beat, and the minimalist art decoration was a nice contrast from the cluttered and clumsy setup at the mansion in the original version. Olivier may have lived in such a setting to mask his loneliness and the malaise of advancing age. Caine seems to wallow in it here as nothing but post-modern art and blue neon lights drench the interiors of the stately old country home.\n\nBy all means see both versions. Both are somewhat enjoyable, and very well-acted. I\u0027d give 7 stars to the original and 8 to this fine remake.\n\nThe Hound.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
