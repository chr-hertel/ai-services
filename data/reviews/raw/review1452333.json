I\u0027ve seen quite a few civil war movies, Seppuku (\u002762), Onibaba (\u002764), Sanjuro (\u002762) and nearly all of Kurosawa\u0027s flicks, but the difference in them and the Seven Samurai lies in its experience. A good one hour into the movie and you\u0027d want to live with the characters, fight with the samurais, curse the bandits and fall in love with a girl. The storyline of this movie is of epic proportions, not even close to any movie you\u0027d have encountered till now, and the way the minutest element of the film is handled, it just makes you sit and appreciate in awe. Every character is portrayed as if we\u0027ve been living with them for years, just that they\u0027re now on screen instead of being with us. A sign of a good movie is that it lasts, a sign of an excellent movie is that it lasts longer, while a sign for a movie like this is that it\u0027ll embed itself in your mind and heart for a long long time to come, and you\u0027ll cherish every moment remembering it. Shichinin no samurai (1954)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
