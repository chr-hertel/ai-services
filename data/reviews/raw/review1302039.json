But the flashbacks to his \"Fantastic Four\"-looking shaved head macho, jealous crazy days with her made me wonder why she had been with him at all, other than his tattooed abs. He does seem to have a lot in common with the guy in \"9 Songs\" as he pretty much just remembers one thing about a relationship and figures the only reason she\u0027d break up with him was sex-related, unless arguing was their foreplay. \n\nBut the drinking and cocaine use begins and never stops and any sympathy evaporated.\n\nThe ages of the women in the movie make absolutely no sense. Sometimes they seem to be jail-bait, but other times they are old schoolmates of the twenty something central characters, and the central party attracts an odd mix of ages. It\u0027s not even clear if they are in or out of college. Certainly the ridiculous conversations about the meaning of life and God (surrounded as they inexplicably are by Buddhist sculptures in one of those fantasy NYC apartments with a very large bathroom) seem like late night dorm bull sessions.\n\nThe flashbacks to illustrations of pseudo-scientific theories and urban legends are amusing but are a waste of time if they are to convince us that any of these deluded idiots are intelligent instead of just stoned. A fight breaks out just so you shouldn\u0027t think that such soul-baring discussions would mean these guys are metrosexuals, as that seems as much a motivation as anything else in this film.\n\nIt was five minutes into the film when Jason Statham inexplicably appears (playing an older guy who may be intended to be like Jack Nicholson along for the ride as in \"Five Easy Pieces\") that I realized this wasn\u0027t the film I meant to see, but another with a similar name. But I was prepared to have an open mind and the audience in the Times Square theater I was in positively responded to the mordant humor. \n\nDebut writer/director Hunter Richards does show potential here in handling romance, as that is the most effective part of the film, at the beginning and end.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
