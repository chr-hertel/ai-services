The only thing that saw needs(unfortunately haven\u0027t seen the 3rd though) is more scare moments. Yes, there is plenty enough gore, and some moments that make you cringe, but it just still isn\u0027t very scary. The ending was also just tremendous!It would be very hard to watch this movie(if you like horror movies) and not crave to see the 3rd, which is not very common.I also like that it tells more about Jigsaw, in the first we barely got to hear anything about him.(another good ending)This movie uniquely gives answers to some questions from the first. This is one of the better horror movies that have been coming out.\n\n7/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
