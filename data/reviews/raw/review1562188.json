Even if it is a comedy and Lars von Trier himself in the start of the movie tells we can lean back and enjoy being entertained, the film has a message that - if you are open to it - will give you something to think about regarding moral and ethics. Like all good movies this has a surprisingly ending. \"The Boss of it all\" has divided the audience in Denmark in 2 groups Â– a group who absolutely dislikes the movie and a group which is rather enchanted with it. As you can understand I belong to the last group.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
