It\u0027s great to see vintage performances and interviews of Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, and Mavis Staples as well as some of Dylan\u0027s fellow musicians and poets from Greenwich Village. We also get small wraparounds in Part 1 of his 1966 concert in which he gets booed for his first electric set that shows how fans can turn on you when you try something different. As soon as I see Part 2, I\u0027ll post an update. I\u0027ve now seen Part 2 and, boy, what a journey as we see Dylan perform for Martin Luther King\u0027s March in Washington, in the Newport festival, doing press conferences in which he says he\u0027s a song-and-dance man instead of a \"protest singer\", and then his first electric concert in which Pete Seeger threatens to cut the wires! During the second half, you hear footage of \"boos\" and \"traiter\" being yelled in England and America although they lessen when you hear Dylan\u0027s biggest hit, \"Like a Rolling Stone\". In the beginning of this second part, Dylan keeps his sense of humor as when he mangles interpreting a road sign for his own pleasure but becomes a bit surly when a couple asks for an autograph later on. No Direction Home ends right before Dylan\u0027s motorcycle accident in 1966 so most of his great stuff is covered here. Afterwards, Charlie Rose interviewed director Martin Scorsese who explained the meaning of the title, \"When you die, you\u0027re home.\" No better words have been spoken!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
