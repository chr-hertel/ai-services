The husband is played by Esai Morales, (Jeff Silva),\"American Virgin\",\u002700, who also starred as Lt. Tony Rodriquez, on NYPD Blue TV \u002793. His wife is Janine Turner,(Terry Silva),\"Birdie \u0026 Bogey\",\u002704, who is very charming and pretty and I really cannot see why Jeff has to find another hot to trot chick to take care of his needs. Jeff plays a very nasty guy who will stop at nothing to get his own way and really has no soul or human concern for others, except HIMSELF. The film will keep you glued to the screen and it is well produced with a great cast of actors.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
