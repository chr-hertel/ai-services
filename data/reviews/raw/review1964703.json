I think what sets this apart from other movies of a similar nature are a few things, mostly to do with the character. 1st, this is the first movie I\u0027ve ever seen Kevin Bacon in that I felt he really met his full potential as an actor. He and the director worked together wonderfully to create a character that didn\u0027t feel wooden or generic and the focus of the movie is on him. There\u0027s only two or three scenes in the movie that aren\u0027t shown from the main character\u0027s viewpoint. 2nd, his character is human and while he thinks quickly on his feet sometimes, he makes some bad decisions based on his emotions that lead to things...getting out of hand (don\u0027t want to spoil things). But as his character says, you don\u0027t know how you\u0027ll react to a situation until it happens. 3rd, the movie is far more realistic than most \u0027revenge\u0027 stories. As much as I like most movies of this nature it was nice to see one where there are real consequences to his choices. 4th, the action in the movie was very visceral and gritty, not flashy or pretty like far too many movies. \n\nOverall the acting was excellent (not just Kevin Bacon but everyone) and the script writing was just as good. The music was very effective at establishing the proper mood. As for the director, I\u0027m coming to enjoy his movies more and more. I think he likes telling an interesting story. If he was out there for the money he\u0027d be directing all the Saw sequels instead of just producing them. This movie didn\u0027t get very good publicity and I think the cover art was poorly done (I\u0027d seen the cover in the video store and it inspired zero interest in me, luckily I saw a preview and gave it a shot). Overall I\u0027d like to see more people watching this movie. This is the first movie I\u0027ve ever gone to the effort of commenting on in the hopes of encouraging people to give it a shot. It\u0027s a shame the production company didn\u0027t put more of an effort into marketing it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
