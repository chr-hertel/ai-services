Keep in mind that I\u0027m a huge Stallone and Dolly fan, but the singing and \"stage antics\" of Stallone in this made me long for Scott Baio\u0027s singing career to make a comeback. Stallone basically sings the way he talks, and jumps around and dances on stage like he\u0027s hyped up on something. Sly\u0027s brother is a good singer, HE ISN\u0027T. Some people should never sing.....EVER. It is actually very hard to watch without actually feeling sorry for him. Dolly must have been mortified once she saw the final product. I\u0027m giving it a two out of ten, simply for the \"shock value\".......", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
