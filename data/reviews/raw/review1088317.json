Rob Morrow gives a wonderfully compassionate touch to this love story that leaves you breathless. I can\u0027t wait to see it again! As I stepped into the journey of this love story I was swept away by the scenes from Africa, Europe, and New York! The movie had me continuously guessing and falling in love with the characters over and over again. Rob Morrow gave a breath taking romantic portrayal of a man every woman dreams about! I have now watched it over and over again and still have the same reaction to the movie and never get tired of seeing this love story. Everyone couple should see this love story! I am looking forward to seeing it again soon!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
