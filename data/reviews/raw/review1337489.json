It is surprisingly clean. No foul language whatsoever and it is soooo rare to find a PG movie that isn\u0027t targeting young kids/families (for those sensitive to this or can appreciate this element).\n\n2. There is a very significant secondary plot about music. In fact, I have this movie to thank for introducing me to the music of Al Green (I also own the soundtrack). The end\u0027s a little cheesy, but for someone who also played open mic\u0027s at one point, it\u0027s nice to indulge a fantasy now and then.\n\n3. Dave Foley\u0027s character has some truly funny moments. His stand up roots really shine through.\n\n4. It\u0027s not a teeny bopper. Lance Bass and his friends are past their college years, and Lance\u0027s love interest just finished grad school.\n\nSo with that, it is difficult to predict who the movie was targeting, but it certainly got my attention.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
