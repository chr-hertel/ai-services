I was really looking forward to it since the book Icon is one of the best spy thrillers I have ever read. What a disappointment it was. The plot only loosely resembles the one in the book, the characters are completely miscast and there\u0027s some appalling acting. A shame really. The story behind Icon is perfect for the silver screen, but I think television budgets just aren\u0027t big enough for a decent adaptation of this spectacular book.\n\nForsyth deserves much, much better than this. Avoid and stick to the book, which is a must-read.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
