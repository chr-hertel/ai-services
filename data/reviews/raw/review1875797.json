Yes, Blackadder may be more Mr. Bean-like, there are rather muxed-ip plots and surprisingly dark humour, but I still like this series. Probably the best thing about this first part of Blackadder is the into and the credits, which are surprisingly fun - the credits have an entertaining song in it (and a different song and credit roll in the last episode) and both have Blackadder boldly riding a black horse. Funnily enough you never see this black horse again in the other series and I think he is one of the best parts.\n\nThis series is a comedy running for 6 episodes. The star is Edmund Blackadder, played by Rowan Atkinson. His companions are Baldrick, played by Tony Robinson and Percy, played by Tim McInnerny.\n\nI recommend this first part to anyone who likes Mr. Bean in some way or another, who likes comedy historical series (just after Richard III) and for people who want a good introduction to Blackadder. Enjoy! :-)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
