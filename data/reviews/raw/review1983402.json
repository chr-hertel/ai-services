This movie was great. Very engaging. Very well acted. \n\nI moved to the Bay area 3 years ago and never really heard about Harvey Milk until recently. The whole story, including Dan White\u0027s \"Twinkie Defense\" is jaw dropping. If you aren\u0027t a right wing bigot, you should thoroughly enjoy this movie. Sean Penn is a class A actor through and through.\n\nPS: If you don\u0027t know much about the subject, go to the movie first, then do some Wikipedia research on Dan White, Harvey Milk, and Anita Bryant.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
