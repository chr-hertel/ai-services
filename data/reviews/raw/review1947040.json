The characters are well developed and you really feel the intensity of the event. It is both funny and endearing. I really would have liked to meet these 8 individuals in person.\n\nIt was intriguing to see the differences in the types of bag offs around the country. It seemed that for some it was not a big deal until you got to Las Vegas and to others (California)the big show was their stores event. I think it is great that the producers caught a glimpse of the culture that exists behind the scenes of the grocery industry for what is considered the most entry level position in the company. It is great to see the youth and their work celebrated in such a way. It also gives you an idea of how competitive it is for that National title of best bagger. What an honor!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
