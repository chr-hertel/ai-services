Could Christian Bale be any better?", "reviewBody": "My review is one on Christian Bale rather than the movie per se. His going from stone-cold to an emotional man is simply flawless. He gets to transmit everything the story needs at the right time. Bale is the greatest actor of his generation and never afraid to get his hands REALLY dirty. He\u0027s played a highly controversial psycho (in an admittedly light version of a really crude and insightful novel... But you realise after you watch him, every time you read the novel again HE IS Patrick Bateman), a LITERALLY starving and tormented loner (please see The Machinist if only for his PERFECT, ground-breaking work of art, which includes both his acting skills and his beyond-emaciated body), a hopeful gay teenager turned hopeless adult (Velvet Goldmine, where he\u0027s amazingly accurate in a minor -as length goes- role and you really believe he\u0027s a shy and lively teenager and minutes later you believe he\u0027s a weary, melancholy adult), a conflicted superhero (the best Batman by far, followed by Michael Keaton of course) and all sorts of middle-of-the-road characters. He\u0027s not your average mainstream star and he\u0027ll never be, I hope... He\u0027s too much in love with his work to become that. Good for him.\n\nEquilibrium is a very fine movie. Highly entertaining, the score was more than okay, the casting does a really good job (I liked The Matrix -although I prefer Equilibrium\u0027s sobriety and rhythm, which many may find boring-, but come on... The actors were inferior and I\u0027m sorry but Keanu Reeves just can\u0027t make it. Where Bale is all complex, nuanced and charismatic, Reeves is just handsome wood) and the fight scenes are beautiful to look at. Cons are the Father, who seemed too weak to me, and the ending which doesn\u0027t do justice to what comes before. In any case, this is an above-average sci-fi flick. Take a look.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
