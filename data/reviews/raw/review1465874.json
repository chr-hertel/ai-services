It was a touchingly uncynical effort. One of the producers was the great John Houseman, Orson Wells\u0027 partner in the Mercury Theater and later the intimidating Professor Kingsfield of \"The Paper Chase\".\n\nSome of the performances I can remember are Rip Torn as egomaniac John Fremont, Lloyd Bridges as an aging Wild Bill Hickock who is too vain to wear glasses, Peter Graves as Daniel Boone, Jeremy Slate as Nathan Hale, Robert Culp as Sam Houston and James McArthur as doomed World War ll hero Rodger Young. Earl Holliman played a dust bowl farmer fighting locusts. I think Michael Rennie played Jefferson Davis.\n\nVan Heflin was the host/narrator, who was later replaced by Russell Johnson who just served as narrator.\n\n\"The Great Adventure\" was on during the 1963-64 season. It was on Friday nights from 7:30 to 8:30 pm eastern time. \"The Great Adventure\" was followed on CBS by \"Route 66\" at 8:30, \"Twilight Zone\" at 9:30 and \"The Alfred Hitchcock Hour\" at 10:00. A strong line up." }
