It was a wonderful story of growing up and as the memories are long distant everything seems so much more magical and larger than life. As it really does when we are adults looking back at our childhood. I thought the acting was excellent and it was very well cast. Daniel Radcliffe plays a very subdued character far removed from HARRY POTTER and shows that he has the talent to continue in the business as an adult. The other 3 boys are good finds and I am sure we will see more of them in the future. While there is only a small cast, each one has a strong role and Mr \u0026 Mrs McAnsh are truly memorable. Kangaroo Island is absolutely stunning and from the dusty outback to the crystal clear coast, the visual splendour is a feast for the eyes. Don\u0027t expect a special effects blockbuster, just enjoy the journey of a lovely story!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
