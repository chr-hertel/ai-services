Maybe it could have been amazing ten years ago, before \"X2\",\"Spiderman\" \"Hulk\", \"Batman Begins\" or \"Revenge of the Siths\". But if you saw any of the movies above, it will be very hard to be surprised by this one.\n\nFirst of all, the cast was not that good. Jessica Alba seems too young for Susan, and Chris Evans just doesn\u0027t seems to fit his role. Mr Doom is very laughable and it\u0027s not scary at all, specially because is interpreted by that guy from \"Nip Tuck\" we\u0027re all used to see as a \"casanova\". The rest of the cast (and the two most important characters, Mr. Fantastic and The Thing) are kinda unknown, but that\u0027s not really a bad thing. I think that the major problem with comic movies is that\u0027\u0027s really hard for fans to get used to see a real person incarnating his/her childhood hero. So, the less famous the actor, the better.\n\nAbout the plot, all I can say it\u0027s a bit disappointing, and it has all the flares and holes that this kind of movie seems to have. It\u0027s not a bad movie, but it\u0027s not original. So to speak, you won\u0027t find anything new in \"Fantastic fours\", but you won\u0027t fall asleep either." }
