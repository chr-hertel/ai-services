But only if you get a version that is close to the original 1922 release. Over time, many poor prints were released. Large parts of the film were thought lost for a long time. In 1988, Enno Patalas was able to reconstruct nearly the whole movie based on an original print discovered in South America. Remarkable in this version is especially the restoration of the original titles and the tinting - yes, \"Nosferatu\" wasn\u0027t simply black and white originally! E.g. night scenes were tinted blue, the titles green. This looks very interesting and really adds to the atmosphere.\n\nFor this restored version, new music was written by German composer Hans Posegga. The score - eery and full of memorable tunes - is in my opinion the best Nosferatu music as yet. Sadly, it isn\u0027t available on any DVD I know of, and even the German television that used to air it with the Posegga music seems to have switched to a different one.\n\nThe DVDs one can currently get seem all to have rather poor English titles - poorly designed (the German ones are often artfully hand-written) and overly shortened. I saw a similar German version in cinema - the rough, simple titles felt like a considerable stylistic incongruity to me, knowing the original.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
