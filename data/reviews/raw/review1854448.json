I was in Miami last week and I have to say it worked, my friend dragged me to this thing, i usually hate female directors, but actually Celia Fox is the real thing, she had some great people on this thing, Anne Goursaud as the Editor!! The woman has done Outsiders, Dracula, Idlewild. Crazy Skilled!!! Steve Fierburg is incredible, and so is Christine Sheaks, BOOGIE NIGHTS, she put together this crazy ensemble cast, definitely not indie but not exactly studio either. Jeffery Dean Morgan, I liked him, the dude can act. The grandma stole this movie, so did Jessie Garcia, he played that different type gangster, very Micheal Corleone, but I do think Wilmer is the shocker here, FEZ was yesterday, Danny Boy is today, and Days of Wrath is here to stay. Good Job Celia Fox, thanks for giving me a reason to watch female directors again!!!!" }
