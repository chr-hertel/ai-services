There is intrigue, excitement, great characters and essentially a storyline that could be developed and extended for a long time. \n\nThe writing is clever and although not everything is believable (the guy notices everything so why does he need a telephone number tattooed on his arm - even i remember telephone numbers!!!) lets face it, it is just good old fashioned entertainment.\n\nI am totally hooked. \n\nI\u0027d say give it a go. Even if it is just for 45 minutes to watch some nice looking men in some well fitted prison outfits!!" }
