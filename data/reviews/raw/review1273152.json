Simply because i just didn\u0027t read into it, but after watching this movie,i was captivated. I\u0027m not saying either that this movie is perfect. No one was actually there. But the people that were are dead,and of course there simply too many sides to this tragic event to actually have 1 extraordinary movie.I saw it as just the both sides without being biased about it.What they did as vengeance .Eric Bana ,must say this film is his finest yet. I love movies that keep me anxious.This was Exactly it! I felt connected to these characters. i felt i was part of the Entente. The most captivating part that sensed like \"the fall of superman\" was towards the end when he really became \"the man who slept in his Closet\". After that scene i was completely in love/already lust with Avner. He definitely has that intenseness about him.That makes him a real actor.
