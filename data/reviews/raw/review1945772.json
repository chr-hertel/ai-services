TODAY\n\nI saw The Shawshank Redemption today, yes nearly after 14 years it was released and after 26 years of my life on earth... I should have seen it much before, I guess. I am truly moved by the story and more than that by the character roles played by Morgan (Red) and Tim (Andy). I have to admit, this is not one of the greatest, BUT THE GREATEST movie ever produced.\n\nBrooks was there, so was Red... I wish I was also there to see it for real.\n\nThis movie gave me new avenues, new thoughts, new energy and more than everything... it gave me what it gave Morgan Freeman...
