I loved ALIEN enough to call it a classic. ALIENS *is* a classic, no doubt about it. Being a big fan of this series, I know I should hate ALIEN 3, arguably the weakest link of this series, and then again why shouldn\u0027t I? The film totally ruined the entire second movie with one brief opening sequence that totally betrays the ending of the first movie. The movie hasn\u0027t even started and already did it have an anti-climax. I hated this opening sequence (save Elliot Goldenthal\u0027s fine score), which is too bad, because everything that follows is rather good, that is, viewing it as a stand-alone feature. ALIEN 3 is no good compared to its superior predecessors, but even with its hated existence, the movie is not as bad as reported. \n\nIn this chapter, picking up the last events from \"Aliens\", Ripley crash lands in Fiorina 161, a high-complex correctional facility, maximum security and home to the universe\u0027s toughest crime-lords and rapists. Ripley wasn\u0027t the only thing surprising to the prisoners, there\u0027s a faster and more terrifying alien, built and ready to kill. But Ripley also discovers a terrifying realization, which she must stop herself.\n\nThe film leaves some things unexplained. Like where did the alien egg come from, and how many are the eggs on the ship (if there\u0027s only one, what was the one attached on one of the passenger\u0027s face.). Worse still is how it\u0027s anti-climatic prologue gets into our nerves. But still, you have to admire the film\u0027s superiority and creativity. The suspense also builds up to terrifying and action-packed climax. The chase through those dark corridors are well shot and swiftly edited.\n\nAnyway, it\u0027s a decent underrated effort considering the fact that it\u0027s a sequel, but it still would totally sink if compared to the first two films. I think that if they could have bought a more decent writer (who won\u0027t kill the really good characters), it could have been better. \n\nRating: ***1/2 out of 5.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
