The story has bride Virginia Williams jilted at the altar by her feckless fianc√© Edward Finlay. Her mother, divorced and hard-nosed editor of a gossip mag Shelley Long, persuades her that they should use the pre-booked honeymoon to indulge in mummy-daughter time. But mum has her own agenda - the idyllic island resort is owned by a reclusive ex-astronaut (Jack Scalia)and mum needs a front-page exclusive... So far, so predictable. Romance? Reconciliation? Retching at saccharine overdose? Well, yes to an extent. Except that there\u0027s an essential intelligence here. Although the characters are broad-brush stereotypes, they\u0027re not simple TV-movie grotesques. Perhaps its her age, but Long eschews the physical slapstick that\u0027s been one of her trademarks and does a credible job as a mother keeping a hesitant grasp on her own emotional history (although she\u0027s less great at suggesting a gossip mag editor who\u0027s red in tooth and claw). From time to time, Long holds back on the emoting and you can actually see a character weighing up the pros and cons of her actions. She\u0027s matched by Williams, who isn\u0027t given a lot to do except express the various shades of \u0027perky\u0027. However, Williams can play a nuance with impressive deftness. As with Long, there\u0027s emotional intelligence at work here - and the two of them make the script go further than you\u0027d think it could. And finally, there\u0027s the storyline. Oh gosh yes, it\u0027s predictable. But it sidesteps the temptation to tie up the ending in pretty pink bows and ribbons. It accepts that romance is a means to happiness - it\u0027s not an end in itself: TV-movie sugar doesn\u0027t rot the teeth out of your head by the time final credits run. The faults in this movie are evident - it wouldn\u0027t stretch the intelligence of a two-year-old - but once you see its strengths, there\u0027s enough to recommend it on a wet afternoon.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
