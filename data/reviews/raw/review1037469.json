She was such a perfect clown I only wish more people could have seen her with Bob Hope in \"The Facts of Life\" because she could do dry deadpan, too. as well as slapstick.\n\nYep, Lucille Ball was wonderful . . . until \"Mame.\"\n\nTrying to see Lucille Ball in \"Mame\" is physically impossible because there is so much Vaseline and filters on the camera lenses that you\u0027d need Windex to see her face in some scenes. So even if you see Lucille Ball in \"Mame,\" you can\u0027t really see Lucille Ball in \"Mame\". Which is a blessing.\n\nThat\u0027s about the nicest thing I can say about \"Mame,\" the movie of the Broadway musical of the movie version of the play (this could go on, but it started with a perfectly funny book called \"Auntie Mame\"). Giving this a bad rap is like beating a sponge. So it does not matter that the music is croaked rather than sung. Most of the songs weren\u0027t much, anyway. There isn\u0027t any difference in the first three. \"It\u0027s Today,\" \"Open a New Window,\" and \"We Need a Little Christmas\" are all the same song. (Celene Dion should do an album with them, they\u0027re so big and dull. ) The killer ballad \"If He Walked Into My Life Today\" needs a confident voice (Edyie Gorme won a Grammy for doing it in 1967) that poor Lucille Ball did not possess when she made this movie. (True, Elaine Stritch can\u0027t carry a tune in a bucket, either, but at least Stritch can put over a song.)\n\nIf you still feel your life is not going to be complete unless you see Lucy in \"Mame,\" notice how there IS dancing in it, but whenever Lucy/Mame starts to do anything beyond a palsied shuffle the camera cuts away, then returns right when the number is over and the star poses with the dancers. Again, it\u0027s just as well. Jane Connell got to reprise the role of pathetic Agnes Gooch after Lucille Ball had Madeline Kahn fired to ensure no comic originality would upstage the star. Connell is a stage performer who, like Carol Channing and Ethyl Merman, can\u0027t scale down her performances for films, so she joins Lucille Ball in being embarrassing, though for different reasons.\n\nThe lavish gowns are by Theadora Van Runkle (Van Wrinkle?) and they provide the color missing in all but one of the cast. \n\nBea Arthur as the actress Vera Charles, Mame\u0027s best friend, ignores everyone and does her own fun thing. If only she was in more scenes. She\u0027s too old for her role, too, but at least she didn\u0027t maim it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
