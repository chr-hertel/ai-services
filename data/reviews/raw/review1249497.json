He got me hooked on it when I was a young girl by pointing out all the gentle humor and the repeated comedic bits that separate it from many other westerns. I still love it for those reasons and more.\n\n\"Yellow Ribbon\" is not John Ford\u0027s best movie, but it may be John Wayne\u0027s. Capt. Brittles is -- needless to say -- the antithesis of Henry Fonda\u0027s Col. Thursday in \"Fort Apache.\" When the film opens, it is obvious Capt. Brittles has earned the respect of his troops and won their loyalty, and by the fade-out they have come to love him like devoted sons.\n\nFor someone who was allegedly so difficult to work with, John Ford put together a truly remarkable stock company of actors and technical personnel. They appeared in his films time and again, and there was more or less a core group of professionals on screen and off that gave all of Ford\u0027s westerns color, excitement and realism. But \"Yellow Ribbon\" has something less expected: warmth. And there\u0027s not a thing wrong with that.\n\n\"She Wore A Yellow Ribbon\" is also arguably the most sentimental movie John Ford ever made, and there\u0027s nothing wrong with that, either.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
