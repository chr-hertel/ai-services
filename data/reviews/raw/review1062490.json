They only carry the highest quality programming, quite evident by their choice to air \"Third Watch\" more than once a day. But then again, as much as I love the show, I would much rather see it go out in a blaze of glory with reruns available than to see the demise of the characters and contents through the years to come. NBC, shame on you! You had the best show in a Friday night slot. I wish the best for the cast and crew and look forward to seeing them on the small screen again real soon. Our thoughts are with you." }
