And when I say indie, I mean true indie. Not a huge budget, big studio film with \"A\" list actors trying to \"keep it real.\" More about using a clever plot device (or several) great directing and sharp acting. The script I felt was well written with several memorable lines in it. Rare these days. The humor was a bit shocking but a refreshing departure from the \"safe\" old used jokes of it\u0027s contemporaries. The performances were solid, skating between stylistic and realism which is a tough line to ride consistently while keeping believability, again, good directing.I enjoyed it and would definitely suggest it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
