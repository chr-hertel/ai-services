Although I do not share the superlatives and I do not think that \u0027Dark Knight\u0027 belongs to the top 10 or even top 100 movies of all times as it is placed now, there are enough interesting things to make it worth seeing.\n\nIt\u0027s dark times out there and our preferred movies sequels get darker also. \u0027Dark Knight\u0027 starts in a routine comics movie style, with a confusing first quarter an hour until we can make sense of the characters and we start understanding that it\u0027s more here than the standard stuff. Sure, we do get a great concentration of acting talents, and just having Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman play two supporting (but key) roles says enough. What is however remarkable is that this is a long film, and yet, tension and quality builds in time, and the last half hour is the most interesting of all - not because but despite all the special effects, acrobatics fights and car races. It builds into a destructive and apocalyptic vision, and the frightening thing is that in today\u0027s world such a vision is almost credible.\n\nAmazingly for a comics movie, at some point in time we start to care about the characters. The evil character in the film is the most interesting as well, and we can only deplore the fact that Heath Ledger did not live to enjoy the success of this film which is due to a large extent to his acting talent. As the film all over, within the limits of the mask and of the convention, this is almost the best we can get.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
