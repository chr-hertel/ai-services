I had no intention of watching this particular movie, it was just \"on\" as I was walking through the room. I was an active alcoholic at the time, and although I was full of denial about my drinking I just couldn\u0027t tear myself away. Things went from bad to worse when a friend watching it with me said, \"Check it out. She (Sarah T) drinks just like you do\", which was of course true but also horrifying as Sarah was clearly an alcoholic.\n\nThis movie haunted me for several years, and planted a seed that led me to AA about 4 years later. If you are an alcoholic, or wondering if you might be, see this movie!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
