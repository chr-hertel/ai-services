It looks like it had a bit money behind it, but it feels second-rate when compared to others of its field and that ending is a complete wimp out. \n\nAt least it has going for it some stylish visual brushes by Wai-keung Lau\u0027s frenetic direction and an imposingly eerie setting (an abandoned theme park, which has some freaky looking clown dolls on a hanging tree) with some sensational art direction (like the opening entrance of the clown face). Too bad that it\u0027s senselessly penned with an messy same-old, same old structure (even though the concept showed more promise than your copy-and-paste \u0027Ringu\u0027 clone) of cheap jolts, typical thrills (that steals its thunder from other films) and lazily constructed characters. Even throughout it demonstrates some unwelcoming camp qualities, where the witless script and self-knowing humour just don\u0027t come off. It irritated, but not as much as the performances do. Bobo Chan in the lead role never convinces and her screaming/crying gave me a splitting headache.\n\nYen along with her friends are looking for her missing brother, despite the warning from her medium mother that he\u0027s dead. It leads them to an amusement park, which closed down over a decade ago after a horrible accident involving the death of a young girl. Instead of finding her brother they come across restless spirits who pick them off one by one.\n\nThe computer effects are well-done and never distracting, as there\u0027s one memorable decapitation sequence that\u0027s brilliantly executed and there\u0027s a little bit of blood \u0027n\u0027gore in the traditional style. Sound effects hold an atmospheric grip, but those constant whooshing noises and whispering voices could\u0027ve been toned down. The music score wasn\u0027t all that effective, even with some jaded cues.\n\nPretty much like a foreseeable, underwhelming haunted house theme park ride.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
