Beautifully composed shots. I always like it when an artistic director can avoid catching high key fever and not slap together a nauseatingly distracting palette.\n\nAnyway. The reveals were so well set up and delivered, I got multiple laughs along the way at least a few times. I remember thinking the writer must have remembered reading Aristotle\u0027s Poetics in weaving the story together.\n\nThe actor\u0027s delivered! It could be a 10, but I got so caught up in the opening camera movement it spun my mind to wa-ondering well into the kitchen. It felt like a nice mini narrative, but like I said, my mind skidded off elsewhere. So, I was not prepared for Sarah\u0027s character\u0027s Mulroney\u0027s reveal. She played that character with such richness. I never saw \"Sex in the City\", nor am I inclined to, but that body of work must have come in handy in fashioning the performance. I am not saying that the other actor\u0027s did not deliver rich performances (I cried at both ends of the spectrum.), but she took me for a wild mouse amusement parkeride! \n\nI have to say that Luke\u0027s character\u0027s dream was, if not a transcript of a real one, carefully and intelligently constructed with more than a little understanding of Freudian psychology.\n\nThis is one jam packed film. It\u0027s tight. Tom Bazooka! You da man.\n\nPS I saw \u0027Guess Who\u0027s Coming to Dinner\" the other day and, there\u0027s one scene with Kate and Spence duking (dooking?) it out to a classical music score that Spence reveals is playing on the family stereo when it suddenly stops as he removes the record. I mention this only in wondering if this movie might did not have some opportunities for that kind of nuance.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
