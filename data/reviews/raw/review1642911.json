The Yanks are furious, they call it a lie and propaganda. They are so brainwashed by they\u0027re so called \"free media\" (read - owned by the rich moguls close to the federal government) that seeing a different aspect of \"The Great US Iraq crusade\" is making them angry. But - at least - it plants a seed of doubt of their own government\u0027s intentions and actions abroad. So the movie has already achieved it\u0027s goal - made the people think and doubt the official propaganda that Bush\u0027s administration feeds to them.\n\nTo say a few words about the movie itself - well, it\u0027s definitely NOT a masterpiece of the cinema. But it\u0027s provocative and brave - that is more than enough.\n\nWay to go, Turks! 10 points to you!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
