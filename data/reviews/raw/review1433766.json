I was really impressed with Richard, Ginger and the team as they bought these houses and rehabbed them. I\u0027m in the real estate biz - and it can be even more cut throat than Hollywood. But one of the draws the show had was the family type atmosphere they seemed to do business with. Sure - they had their knock down drag out fights - but that\u0027s family ;) Of course, it doesn\u0027t hurt that Ginger is so cute ;) Then there was the extra mile they would go - to rehab a house and sell it back to the guy, to invite the previous owners over to see what they did. A\u0026E has ruined the essence of the show by changing teams. I thought flip this house was trademark properties and I was disappointed to see another company this season. If Trademark shows up somewhere else - I\u0027ll be sure to watch that show! Especially if Ginger is there ;)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
