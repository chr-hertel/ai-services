No entertainment", "reviewBody": "This movie is another one of those art house movies that are works of modern art. Most people either don\u0027t like it or they don\u0027t, and they claim they do, so that it looks like they appreciate art, and thus don\u0027t seem like ignorants in front of other people who found it as stupid as they did in the first place. even if you didn\u0027t understand that the point is the movie has no point. there are much better movies on drugs out there. the only reason this movie is watchable is that it has some brilliantly conceptualized and shot scenes and that for some strange reason i knew what was going to happen and just wanted to make sure it did. a good film maybe if you are a film student but worthless as entertainment. watch it if you like these art house kind of movies.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
