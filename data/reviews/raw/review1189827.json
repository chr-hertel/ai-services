The music is great and the hole concept is real perfection. A truly old cult classic and a great great movie should be there in the 250 top movies in my opinion. Aykroyd is also one of the greatest and if Belushi should be alive today i think those 2 people would have make a lot of classics movies.\n\nThe Movie is about Jake and Elwood two brothers whos \"On a mission from god\" and the just gets into bigger and bigger troubles. \n\nThe blues Brothers is a musical/comedy with some of the greatest musicians in the world. The late Ray Charles , Aretha Franklin late Cab Calloway and James Brown.. We shall not forget the band that also is very good.\n\nIts a shame that we never could see more of John Belushis fine work but while we still can lets go out and buy the new 25th Anniversary DVD and enjoy this masterpiece from this two comedy legends that Brought Blues To A New Age!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
