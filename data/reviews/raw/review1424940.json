I don\u0027t often get emotional over TV, especially nowadays but this episode gets me every time I see it. The performances by the main three people in this episode are wonderful. Bill Bixby is great. Laurie Prange who plays the crippled girl is perfect. Anytime I see her in anything else I remember her outstanding performance from this episode. She had such a sweet and gentle way about her. Finally John Mcliam as the old man who did not want to get involved until the end was fantastic. I have seen him in a lot of different TV shows over time and he\u0027s always great. The show as a whole always kind of makes me sad. David Banner always helps someone in need and then he has to leave in the end. The piano tune always plays at the end to keep the saddening mood. Still this is a very good show.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
