There might be bureaucracies, politics, religion and culture in the way, but if ordinary people could just talk to each . . .\n\nThe \u0027ordinary people\u0027 are also usually those disenfranchised in a cross-cultural way. In Bridge Over the Wadi, they were children. In Lemon Tree, it is women who pick up the, \u0027if only we could live together\u0027 banner.\n\nSalma is a Palestinian widow. She has lived on the green line border between Israel and the West Bank for decades. She tends a lemon grove. Handed down to her through generations. She barely scrapes an existence from it, but it is her whole world.\n\nOn the opposite side, the Israeli Defense Minister moves into a big new house facing her lemon grove. The Israeli security forces declare the proximity of Salma\u0027s trees a security threat. They issue orders to uproot them. Salma engages Ziad Daud, a Palestinian lawyer. They go to the Israeli Supreme Court to try to save the trees.\n\nMeanwhile, Mira Navon, the Defense Minister\u0027s wife, is trapped in her luxurious new home but pretty miserable. She feels increasingly sympathetic to Salma\u0027s plight. Hubby makes public expressions of concern, but says he cannot go against the recommendations of security forces.\n\nAs an interim measure, Salma is prevented from entering the grove. The trees start to shrivel. This disparity is highlighted when the Navons throw a lavish party, with \u0027authentic Egyptian food.\u0027 But realise that that the caterer hasn\u0027t brought lemons. It seems a minor matter to pick up a few lemons from the adjoining grove . . .\n\nWith films like this, it is always tempting to look for bias. Although it was part-funded by the Israeli Film Council that doesn\u0027t make it pro-Israeli in this case. It\u0027s based on a true stories but (as always) there will be claims that it is too \u0027pro-Palestinian\u0027 or \u0027pro-Israeli\u0027 in the telling. Director Eran Riklis was born in Jerusalem, raised in USA, Canada and Brasil, graduated from film school in England, and now lives in Tel Aviv. He claims his film is, \"about solitude as it is reflected in the lives of two women.\"\n\nOne of the film\u0027s main contributions is to explain the impossible deadlock and how both sides are pretty powerless, given their institutions, to change much. The Israeli Supreme Court verdict, when it comes, is gut-wrenching. But Palestinian officialdom seems more worried about propriety than the widow\u0027s attempts to protect her property. It is all superficially civilised. Lemon Tree initially disappoints me for not being more hard-hitting on political themes. But given how the politics of both sides can be excruciatingly tedious, Riklis has made a wise choice in turning real life political drama into a simple human interest story. In that, it Lemon Tree achieves something of a microcosm for the disputes. But does the film make creative and constructive inroads, or is it simply a pleasant and aesthetic way of not coming to terms?\n\nMost of the comments I hear about how remarkably even-handed it is have come from liberal Israeli commentators. And there is much truth in their view. But a gulf still exists. There are no end of projects (and movies) focussing on peace initiatives between the two sides. Palestinians are often unhappy that such projects ignore the inequalities between them and Israeli Jews. Or act as a conscience-salve for the Israelis. \"Existence first, co-existence later\", has became a common Palestinian slogan. Lemons are a major crop in the area. They need a lot of water. Just like Salma, banished from her own grove, the Palestinians do not control their own water supply. Just like Salma, in times of crisis, they may lack the means of survival. Palestinians seeing Lemon Tree may agree about its even-handedness. Yet, like Salma, leave a little less sanguine about the value of emotional empathy between the two women. Or so sympathetic to the understanding Mira. Yet in the festering political deadlock, films of such beauty are still better than nothing.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
