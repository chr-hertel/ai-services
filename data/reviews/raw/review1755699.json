Yet no one was more in touch with the blazing pulse of creation than this tormented man, whose transcendent work has touched us all.\n\nTo be confronted with such a life, and such a film, is not for the faint of heart; like Van Gogh\u0027s restless and fiery art, Barnett\u0027s script is uncompromising -- and his acting powerful.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
