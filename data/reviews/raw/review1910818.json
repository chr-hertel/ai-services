The highlight of this film is a scene where Popeye think he has the football and is running it back for a touchdown but in reality he just has Bluto\u0027s head and is dragging him. The football action is pretty nice throughout as Popeye ends up having to plan the other team by himself. Wimpy appears in a couple scenes and adds some nice laughs as well." }
