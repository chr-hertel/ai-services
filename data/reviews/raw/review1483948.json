I love Jane Austen and so does my mother. We were excited to see how well they portrayed the story of the five Bennet sisters. WHat a disappointment! Really! We couldn\u0027t stop laughing at the horrible acting and the goofy characters. The costumes were terrible, the people chosen were terrible! Not only that, but we were bored out of our minds during the whole film! It was the biggest waste of 10 bucks, not to mention the two hours of my life that I will never ever get back! Jane Austen would consider this a slap in the face. I also didn\u0027t think that Kiera Knightly\u0027s acting couldn\u0027t get any worse from Pirates. but guess what? I was wrong! I\u0027ll admit it--I was very wrong. She hit the bottom of the barrel with this movie.\n\nThe truly great version of this novel is the 1995 BBC mini-series starring Colin Firth. The characters are superbly played and the scenery is just beautiful. This version is so perfect, I give it a 20! Shame on everyone who enjoyed the 2005 version! Shame on you all!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
