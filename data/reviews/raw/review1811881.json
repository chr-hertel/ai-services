Kar Wai uses less colour, more shadow, rain and heat and more rawness. The tone is much darker than in \u0027Fa Yeung Nin Wa\u0027 as the film is set in the 50s. The music is beautiful and effectively used. And, here too Kar Wai ends up making a powerful product. Though this film was a box office failure, it is an artistic victory.\n\n\u0027A Fei Zheng Chuan\u0027 tells the story of 6 individuals whose lives are interconnected by each character\u0027s search and struggle for an identity. It\u0027s about loneliness, unrequited love, lost love, the search for love, and how the search continues. Kar Wai clevely brings up the theme of sex (without showing any nudity). The writing is excellent and the characterization is strengthened by superb and unique performances. The late Leslie Cheung\u0027s Yuddy is not a very likable person but we do sympathize with this man and recognize him. Maggie Cheung as Su gives one of the most subtle and finest performances. Carina Lau is energetic and terrific as Mimi. Rebecca Pan gracefully downplays her part. Andy Lau\u0027s Tide and Jacky Cheung\u0027s Zeb too are relatable and the actors are nothing short of remarkable. Actually, I recognize all the characters in this film.\n\nI loved the cinematography, especially the long shots. One of my favorite shot is the introduction of the scene that glides from the Phillipine streets to Yuddy and Tide in a lunch bar. This is one fine example of skillful camera-work. The shaky camera (which thankfully isn\u0027t overdone) and the close-ups that mostly take place during conversations and intimate moments between two characters work very well. Doyle\u0027s camera-work simply guides us through the lives of these characters.\n\nSumming it up, \u0027A Fei Zheng Chuan\u0027 works on many levels. It is an excellent study of characters, it \u0027tells\u0027 a universal story in a poetic way and it is a fine cinematic experience.\n\nA bird that never lands will one day suddenly seize to exist." }
