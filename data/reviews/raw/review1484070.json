The movie stars James Fransico from the spiderman movies who has really managed to find himself a nice role that will really distinguish him as someone who can do a good job with dramatic roles.He actually managed to take on a \u0027James Dean\u0027 type of presence throughout the whole movie. It was a very accurate portrayal of \"dogfights\" in WW1. The action was amazing but not out of reality. The actual authenticity of the way things were back then was done on an excellent scale. You were really given a sense of how everything was for them back in that era down to the last detail. The storyline itself is very suspenseful to the very end and they even manage to give you a realistic \u0027love story\u0027 that would actually happen between a man and woman in the war. You could really feel the sense of \u0027honour\u0027 and \u0027brotherhood\u0027 between the different pilots. This is definitely a real \u0027man\u0027s movie\".", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
