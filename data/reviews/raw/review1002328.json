Both act in their own styles with their own sense of humor. It makes the movie excellent to watch for both the fans of the British humor and the more \u0027forced\u0027 American comedy.\n\nThe story is really great, especially for a comedy which often just relies on its jokes and comical situations. Sure, \"A Fish Called Wanda\" also has got its weak moments, such as the whole side-plot with Ken Pile trying to kill the old lady. Yes, it\u0027s funny in a comical way but it doesn\u0027t really blend in with the rest of the movie.\n\nAnother thing that distinct this movie from other comedies is the wonderful cast. All of us of course already know John Cleese\u0027s comical talent but it really is Kevin Kline that steals the show. The best acting performance I have ever seen in a comedy! He really, really deserved his Oscar for this movie.\n\nHilarious comedy, watchable and recommendable for both the fans of British and American comedies.\n\n9/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
