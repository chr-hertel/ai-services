Sure it\u0027s a little dated (it was made in 1974 and shot on 16mm film), but it\u0027s got the heart of a lion. The reason this film is considered an absolute classic is because regardless of the story not being 100% true, it FEELS so real. It\u0027s VERY believable that something like that can actually happen in real life. The fact that it\u0027s virtually bloodless/goreless, contradictory to what so many people have claimed over the years, shows just how much of an effect it has on the viewer. Also, notice there is NO musical score in the entire movie. Just odd sounds, screaming and a chainsaw buzzing, which only helps to create a terrifying atmosphere that seems so real. All of this and more is the reason why the slickly produced soul-less Hollywood remake can\u0027t touch the original. THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE belongs in EVERY horror fans collection.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
