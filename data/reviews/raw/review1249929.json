I have looked high and low for years for horror westerns. Horror westerns are very rare indeed and have only come across a couple in my search. Overall it is a decent film that gets such a high rating from me because of the boldness of creating this film in a market place that doesn\u0027t really have a spot for western horror. Watch this if you are looking for a spooky time. If you are looking for production values through the roof don\u0027t bother. Acting is good and the cinematography was acceptable. Edward Albert did a great job as the sheriff although at the beginning he maybe over did it just a little but i suspect that was part of the script so they could show the change in attitude towards his prisoner. Chris Atkins did a good job as the aloof would be criminal. But the cake goes to the actor who played Padro. I have not seen him in anything else and he don\u0027t have many lines but the way he carried himself was well done.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
