It was based on a five page original story by Le Carre for which we paid an unreasonably large fee and scripted by Stanley Mann, a Canadian writer. It was directed by Ted Kotchef who went on to create the character RAMBO with Sylvester Stallone.\n\nIt was quite good and might stand up to a TV showing even now - but, of course, the Cold War background is very dated.\n\nAnthony Perry\n\nAnyone interested e-mail me.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
