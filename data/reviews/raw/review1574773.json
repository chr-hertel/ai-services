It is said to be a sad movie, but laughable all the same. I agree with that comment. It can make one think, and then re-think one\u0027s aspects on life and death. And all that life\u0027s inventory has in store for yourself.\n\nThe actors/actresses surprise. You will see someone, and think to yourself, \"I know that person. What show/movie was it I seen them in, or in one case, what music band.\" Enjoy. Truly worth its\u0027 watch." }
