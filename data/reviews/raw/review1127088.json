The acting is fair, the story is alright, and the documentary-comments and the weirdness in between give it that little extra to make it hilarious.\n\nAnyone who knows what procreation is and who has a good sense of humor would definitely enjoy this movie.\n\nI gave it 8/10 due to how original it is, how so many of the comments ring true, and for the fact that it was That entertaining.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
