Steven Seagal made his debut with Above The Law and while it\u0027s a fairly well made action flick, I was often times bored with the standard story and overall assembly line villains put in the way of Seagal. That\u0027s not to say the movie isn\u0027t fun, it is. Above The Law is too routine though to grade higher than guilty pleasure. Although Seagal and Grier have good chemistry. However I enjoyed Seagal\u0027s next three movies a lot more.\n\n* * out of 4-(Fair)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
