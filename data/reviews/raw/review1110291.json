I watched the American version purely out of curiosity and it couldn\u0027t have been any more disappointing. The script was pretty much WORD FOR WORD (apart from the very ODD lame attempt to cover up the fact they weren\u0027t professional or indeed creative enough to be original by throwing in a couple of American versions of the jokes that featured in the English version). I have watched the English version more than a few times and as a result I know the episodes fairly well. While looking at the American version I found myself pretty much able to say a line from the script before the character even said it. I think thats a true testament to what I\u0027ve said above about it being word for word. Also the acting.......The words \"wooden\", \"unprofessional\" \"uncomfortable\" and \"trying to hard\" spring to mind. They have taken one of the most classic shows ever to be broadcast in Britain and turned it into a mockery. Anyone who is tempted to watch this sham and poor excuse of comedy...Tune into something else thats actually worthwhile and deserves your time." }
