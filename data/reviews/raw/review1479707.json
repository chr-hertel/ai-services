As a Film Critic, I feel that for Monteverde\u0027s first feature film, Bella was phenomenal. It moved me! I laughed, I cried, I was intrigued the whole 90min. The casting was brilliant. I was very impressed by both Eduardo Verastegui and Tammy Blanchard. They played very real and powerful characters. The ending was a surprise that left me feeling good- it wasn\u0027t expected at all! Coming home after viewing the film in Toronto, I was left contemplating the movie and the subtle messages throughout. The Cinematography was ingenious. I recommend this move to people of all walks of life- It was a great film!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
