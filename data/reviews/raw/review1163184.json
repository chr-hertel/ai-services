This movie is not intended for you. This movie is intended for those of us who want to watch a fun, action filled, gee-whiz movie. It is for those of us WHO want to suspend our Disbelief and forget about the Real World.\n\nYeah, the movie has some corny lines, and scenes, and improbable situations. This was not intended to be a Cineme Realite film to be dissected and critiqued. If you can\u0027t watch a movie for its entertainment value.....don\u0027t bother with this one. It is not for movie snobs. It is a movie for us \"average Joes\" who simply want to be entertained. And it succeeds at that.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
