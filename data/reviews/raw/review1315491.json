I should have included, if I didn\u0027t, BTF II which was a terrible piece of trash. This one goes in a different direction as Lloyd, Fox and DeLorean take their act to the old West. Of course Biff\u0027s ancestor is there to make life miserable if not impossible for Fox. Steenburgen provides an unexpected and very touching bit of romance for Lloyd, while Fox amuses himself by going by the name of Eastwood. It\u0027s all good fun, climaxed by a wild if somewhat overdone train run. A young Shue works well as Fox\u0027s own love interest and the wrap up is fine.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
