He was an absolute fan of this kind of movies and I guess I\u0027ve inherited that passion from him, because since then I try to watch and buy as many (classic) war movies as I can find. So far I already have several of them in my private DVD collection, but until now, \"The Guns of Navarone\" wasn\u0027t a part of it. The main reason for that is because I hadn\u0027t seen it before and therefor didn\u0027t know what to expect of it. But now that it was finally shown on television, I was able to tape it and to watch it.\n\nWhen in 1943 the Germans are attempting to bully neutral Turkey into joining the Axis, 2,000 British troops are trapped on the small and strategically unimportant Greek island Kiros. Something has to be done to save them and there is only one way to get there: by boat. But it\u0027s impossible to come near to the island because the only sea route is defended by two gigantic German anti-ship batteries, deployed in a massive cliff side bunker on the island of Navarone. An air attack has been attempted before and proved to be useless and the only option that is left is sending a team of six Greek and English mountaineers to meet up with partisans to try and dynamite the guns. The team does not only face the almost impossible task to conquer the difficult terrain, they also have to try to get past a German garrison and to make things worse, there also appears to be a traitor among them...\n\nAbout one thing I\u0027m already certain: I\u0027ll buy this movie on DVD as soon as I can find it. This is one of the better classic war movies that I\u0027ve seen lately and I really had a good time watching it. Not only does it give a more realistic view on the war, the characters are also a lot more realistic. They aren\u0027t as invincible as you sometimes see in other classic war movies (think for instance of \"Where Eagles Dare (1968)\"), in which the Americans or other allies seem to carry some kind of magic shield around them that can\u0027t be penetrated by German bullets, while they can kill hundreds of the enemy with only one bullet. In this movie they have to deal with all kinds of difficulties like difficult terrain, a traitor,... and yes, even the good guys can get killed or wounded.\n\nWhat I also liked was the fact that this movie was shot in Greece and therefor gave a realistic feeling to the setting, without feeling like a brochure for a romantic holiday (like Captain Corelli\u0027s Mandolin). I know, we all expect that and believe that it is normal when we see it, but I\u0027ve already seen otherwise and it\u0027s something you didn\u0027t always get at the time. Think for instance of the movie \"The Battle of the Bulge\" (1965), which was supposed to be situated in the Belgian Ardennes, but which was shot with olive trees in the background and in a desert-like terrain. And trust me, I\u0027m Belgian myself and I know the region all too well, so I know that there really isn\u0027t such a type of terrain to be found there.\n\nNext to the good story and the correct decor, this movie also offers some fine acting from a great classical cast. With Gregory Peck, David Niven, Anthony Quinn, Anthony Quayle,... you get some of the most famous actors at the time and they all did a very nice job in this movie. Add to this the fact that story was very good, that the action still looked nice, that everything was shot in the right country and that everybody spoke the correct language. Then you know that there is absolutely nothing more I could ask for in this movie. I give this movie a well deserved 7.5/10.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
