One of the first scenes we are introduced to includes the stuffing of money into a motorcycle gas tank. What caught my eye was that the gas tank was the American flag. The placing of drug money into the American flag shows this nation\u0027s excessive greed and dependence on money, not to mention its drug-peddling sub-culture. However, this image seemed to disappear because the money was hardly ever talked about, or shown again. \n\nThe film began as a comparison to the westernized cowboy movies. Their bikes were visually compared to horses throughout the movie. When a tire blew, it had to be replaced, an image that was compared to the changing of a horse\u0027s shoes. Their western trip continued with a hitchhiking hippie who brought Billy and Captain America to his community. The hippie communities were a present day comparison to the Native American way of life. They lived and worked off the land, relying on food and passing the \"peace pipe.\" They even lived in abandoned native homes. The freedom experienced in this part of the film would never again be recaptured. It was visually represented by shots of the landscape.\n\nWhen they left the community, they entered a more rural, small town area where they were instantly imprisoned. In prison, they met one of the most interesting characters of the whole movie, the alcoholic Jack Nicholson. When he decided to tag along for the ride to New Orleans, he was in a suite and tie (a visual statement of a man escaping from his urbanized way of life). He bribed the police and told the two main characters that he could get them out if they haven\u0027t killed anyone that was white. This statement, alone, shows the prejudice of small town America in the 60\u0027s, a time supposedly of civil rights. One of Jack Nicholson\u0027s last statements was the epitome of the movie. He said that the people were afraid of the two bikers because of their freedom. Freedom can be seen as dangerous. \n\nAfter their attack in the woods, they move on to a bordello and experiment with LSD in a cemetery. The visuals of the cemetery scene took up a great amount of time and seemed to make the movie into a piece of art. Taking styles from French New Wave Cinema, the camera shot the scene in a grainy film representing the hazy confusion of drug usage. It was like a montage, in a way, but only it was out of chronological order and was mixed with religious prayers and symbols. It truly gave the effect of an LSD trip to the audience, showing the pain, ecstasy, and confusion of drugs. The movie ends shortly after in an unexpected bloody manner. The two bikers were shot down on the side of the road by hicks who probably represented Nicholson\u0027s earlier remark. They were afraid of them for their freedom, jealous of their way of life. They were scared of what a free way of life could mean for their community. This freedom, oddly enough, was mainly symbolized by their long hair. \n\nIn the end, what can we take from this film? It was a piece of art that moved from the freedom of the open west, to the captivity of the southeast. As civilization moved out of the 60\u0027s, the hippie population became scarce and was looked down upon like black people of the day. America was growing older. The hippies began to have families of their own, and the 60\u0027s came to a close. The fear of politics and war thrust the youth of the nation into an urbanized mold. \"The man\" is seen as victorious in this film, imprisoning and eventually killing our two main protagonists because of their freedom. This is the same freedom that this nation was said to have been built upon. One could look at this film and realize that we really are not free at all. We follow the crowd instead of following the road. The money in the gas tank was destroyed, in the end, along with the lives of Billy and Captain America. This movie taught us, however, to eventually forget about the money and enjoy the freedom of America as it should be experienced." }
