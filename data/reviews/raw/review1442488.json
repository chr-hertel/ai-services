The definition of that decade being do everything Quick, Fast, and Cheap. This type of film making can be seen by almost all films of the decade unless it was made by Spielberg or Lucas or any of there clones. This movie (Friday The 13th) was shot for around $400,000 and made almost 50 million. That is a business procedure that still goes on today. Shoot cheap advertise well and the audience will come regardless of the film\u0027s integrity. Except this film has integrity unlike Roger Cormen films from the 50\u0027s on which were made just for profit. Yes I know that is in fact how this film started but that is not what it ended up being when the final project was shown before a projector bulb. When you watch the film you can see the love that went in to this monumental undertaking of cheapness. If there had not been that love then this film would have looked like another crappy film from that bygone era, like The Fog which was given a huge budget after the success of Halloween and sucked because John Carpenter brought nothing new too the table. He had to be humbled by the crap that is that film our we never would have gotten the low budget great The Thing. The same thing happened with Sean S. Cunningham after directing Friday The 13th. When he did the big budget dud Deep Star Six he was humbled, but it also killed his directing career. Now he is only a producer who is still looking for that next project that will bring him back to the spot light he deserves like Carpenter gets. Until such time though I will sit back and relish his masterpiece that is Friaday The 13th.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
