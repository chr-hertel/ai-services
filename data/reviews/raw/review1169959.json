The film is a solid comedy with some good performances and although at times it is a bit ridiculous, its better than most slapstick Hollywood comedies. Ben Stiller is good in the lead, although i think this is his typecast role and his dramatic scenes weren\u0027t too great. Patricia Arquette and Tea Leoni were both great in female roles, and the animated Alan Alda was also very good here. George Segal was also great, loved his acting as well as Richard Jenkins and Josh Brolin who played two gay officers. Mary Tyler Moore\u0027s acting was a bit of a joke to me, i didn\u0027t like her here. The film is written well, funny at times, not great but good to me. 8/10 #237 on my list of all-time favorite films", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
