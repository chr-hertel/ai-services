I ran across this one on the Turner channel and picked it up a little into the beginning and was about to move on but watched a bit and then some more and then ... the whole thing. Outstanding cast, lighting , characters , and ending. 1947 and not a happy smiling ending. Outstanding movie, compared to, in my opinion, African Queen, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind, She wore a yellow Ribon, Dr Shavago , 84 Charing Cross Road: flicks you want to see at least once every year.Next time will make sure to see it from the beginning.Debra Karr was excellent, in fact the whole cast was so believable.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
