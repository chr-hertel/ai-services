If Tony Jaa lived in the 70s, Bruce Lee wouldn\u0027t exist at all. I didn\u0027t get the story of this movie, because I saw it in Thai. I even recommend everyone to see this movie without subtitles, because the (probably) poor story would have a negative effect on your judgment, just like Ong Bak. There is only one thing why every action-lover should watch this though: the fight-scenes. Without invisible ropes (matrix/crouching tiger) or fake fights (rocky, or every American action movie), Tony Jaa beats everyone up. He breaks about 50 arms and legs in one action scene, with the terrible sounds of cracking bones, this scene really thrills. But the best and visually most beautiful fight scene is against the Capoeira-man. Two martial-arts styles fight against each other in a room filled with fire and water. Totally amazing. Order this movie from ebay, it is really worth your money, I guarantee. If you liked Ong Bak, then Tom Yum Goong is more than twice as good. Tony Jaa makes the impossible possible. See it!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
