The descendant, Benjamin Gates (Nicolas Cage), follows in the dreams of his forbearers by seeking a treasure that was originally the Knights Templar\u0027s war booty from the Crusades. When the knights decided that the riches were too much for one man alone they hid it under the noses of Europe\u0027s rulers for centuries. Eventually the knights became the Freemasons and their hidden treasure was brought overseas by pilgrims and ended up in the hands of America\u0027s Founding Fathers. Once in their possession, the Founding Fathers decided the same thing that the Knights did some 450 years earlier: the treasure was too great for one man alone or even one government. While the American Revolution was taking place, the Founding Fathers hid the treasure from the invading British while leaving clues to the treasures whereabouts on the dollar bill, the back of The Declaration of Independence, and by telling one of Ben Gates\u0027s ancestors that he could find keys to the treasures whereabouts on the ship that it was brought to America on.\n\nIn present day, Ben has found the ship named The Charlotte and a hint leading to a map that is supposedly on the back of The Declaration of Independence. However, to Ben\u0027s misfortune his colleague treasure hunter, Ian Howe (Sean Bean) betrays him once the clue is found. Suspecting Ian of plotting to steal The Declaration, Ben decides to do it first in order to secure the treasure. Even if Ben accomplishes this task, he still has to deal with Ian, his men, and the FBI who are already suspicious of his motives. Ben is accompanied by Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) and Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) on the hunt for the treasure. Abigail is at first reluctant because of her responsibility for The Declaration\u0027s security. She and Ben\u0027s father, Patrick Gates (Jon Voight), soon realize the necessity of the mission.\n\n\"National Treasure\" has a handful of uninspired action scenes and few great actors like Jon Voight and Harvey Keitel in the supporting roles. Voight and Keitel do the best any actor can possibly do with such formulaic and bland material. Diane Kruger (Troy) gives a mediocre performance. Sean Bean does his very best as the tempted villain, a role he truly has talent for and should perform more often (though not so much as to typecast himself). Nicolas Cage gives an unmemorable performance and seems out of place in this cheap, fast paced action-thriller. At his age he should retire to dramas and psychological thrillers, which despite being very demanding on an actor would suit him better. However, the main hindrance to everyone\u0027s performance was shabby dialogue and a summer flick plot.\n\nDirector John Turteltaub (\"Phenomenon\", \"The Kid\") encounters some basic problems with \"National Treasure\" that many movies of its genre do these days. The one-liners (important ingredients in an action movie) were sparse and dull. The comic relief is just too dependent on the annoying sidekick Riley. Another troubling aspect of the film is the far-fetched plot that is all too common in Jerry Bruckheimer productions (\"Armageddon\", \"The Rock\"). Even worse was that two-dimensional feel surrounding these cardboard characters.\n\nThis film has a plot that is hard to follow but if you watch closely you\u0027ll realize the confusion is not from an intelligent script beyond our grasp, but instead the filmmakers\u0027 fast paced editing.\n\nSeems to be living in the hype of \"The Da Vinci Code\".\n\n5/10" }
