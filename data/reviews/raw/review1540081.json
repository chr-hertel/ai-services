The lady appears to be gravely ill, but when she is alone with Kirk, she is surprisingly spry and zaps him--dragging him to an ancient sex-change machine that puts the woman\u0027s mind in Kirk\u0027s body and vice-versa. The results are unintentionally hilarious--almost as campy and silly as PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE!!! Normally, Shatner isn\u0027t exactly subtle in his role as Captain Kirk, and most of us have come to love this campy overacting. However, here, he plays a hysterical and mentally ill woman now residing within his body and the results are just bizarre and completely off the top of the overacting chart! He shrieks and belows and pounds and behaves like a woman who is experiencing every pain of a lifetime of PMS all in one very, very bad day!!!! So, what we have here is a mighty stupid premise combined with shameless overacting as the rest of the actors watch Shatner bellow and wildly gesticulate. No wonder the series was canceled with episodes like this one! Nowhere is there any evidence of the brilliance of earlier episodes.\n\nUPDATE: By the way, it isn\u0027t just me who hated this episode. At the 50th anniversary Star Trek convention in Las Vegas, this was voted as one of the 10 worst of all episodes from every Trek franchise! That is some ignoble designation!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
