This is a loving Valentine to instrument making \u0026 music in general. We get to see the Steinway piano being produced over a one year period, from trees in the forest, to the finished product. The film is rife with interview footage with the workers who poured their life \u0026 love into this (and all of the)piano. The film also gets screen time with interviews with figures from the musical world (Harry Connick,Jr.Lang Lang,etc.). This film,like the piano itself is a labour of love \u0026 is well worth seeking out. Distribution is a bit limited,due to it\u0027s release on video,but will be well received when it is released on DVD.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
