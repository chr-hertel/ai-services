It deals with simple problems that everyday middle schoolers go through. It is usually easy to follow and fun. Lizzie and her friends deal with not complicated, harsh issues but ones that teens still face such as boyfriends, peer troubles, a first job, \"my crazy family\", stuff like that. I also like it because it\u0027s appropriate for anyone while still appealing (at least a little, admit it, it IS addicting!!!) to the older genre. Also, Hilary Duff does a good job playing her part as Lizzie, and her T.V. family seems so real to me, like they really seem like they work together as a \"real\" family. This is a cute show that any age can and will enjoy." }
