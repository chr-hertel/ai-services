Adore them. And I thought no-one would ever be able to make a movie out of it. Well, I was wrong. It was brilliant! I just saw it on German TV. Wish I could\u0027ve seen it in English but, anyways, I think they did quite a good job in dubbing it in German. \n\nI didn\u0027t think I\u0027d like this movie at all, since I\u0027ve seen too many of my favorite books turned into movies which were just crap (one reason why, to this date, I refuse to watch any of the \"Lord of the Rings\"-movies, despite all the enthusiastic critics I\u0027ve read). But I must say I did like \"Hogfather\". I read the reviews here before watching it and I was worried none-the-less. But they really did a great job. \n\nOf course, I don\u0027t agree with all the castings of characters and stuff (like the wizards or corporal Nobbs - though I think it\u0027d be hard to find the perfect way to show Nobby...). And yes, there were a few little things a true fan could argue about, but in general, it was pretty much perfect. They stayed sooo close to the books, it\u0027s unbelievable. To fans this film really is a treat. The problem with that, of course, is that anyone who\u0027s never heard of the Discworld before might find it difficult to get into the movie. But to me it\u0027s, basically, a movie done for the fans of Terry Pratchett and his Discworld. It\u0027ll never be what I see in my head/mind when reading the books, but, then again, that\u0027s an impossible feat anyhow. \n\nFor example, I didn\u0027t like Death\u0027s mask much, but I loved how they did that \"spark\" in his eyes. Especially at first. It does get a little weak after a while, but all in all, can\u0027t think of a better way to portray him/do his mask. \n\nTo me, it\u0027s a definite \"must-watch\", even to suspicious fans as me, and yes, I do agree with others here that they should do more movies on the Discworld! As long as it\u0027s the same people who made this one. \n\nI will still see my own movie in my head when reading the books, but I can only thank everybody involved in making this movie for bringing this awesome world onto the screen. I hope that I\u0027ll be able to buy it on DVD sometime. Didn\u0027t have no luck with the computer game (games -?) so far, so I can\u0027t wait for being able to get the DVD of this movie. \n\nAnd yes, I hope that in the next movie (if there\u0027ll be one) we\u0027ll get to see more of Ankh-Morpork. There\u0027s so much I\u0027d love to see come alive on-screen. \n\nAnyhow, if you get a chance, watch it. Though, I think it\u0027d really be better if you knew at least a little bit about the whole Terry Pratchett-/Discworld-universe before you do. \n\nAnd if you don\u0027t, give it a try anyways. \n\nI give it an 9 out of 10 due to the few things I felt weren\u0027t quite as good as they could\u0027ve been. Still, just loved it!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
