He and the movies he was in, generally speaking, were trash, I mean absolute garbage. He was a huge, slobby guy and not funny. You can be a big slob and still be a real likable actor, like John Candy. But, this guy was no John Candy. David Spade, his comedic partner in this film, isn\u0027t exactly the Bob Hope of comedians for this age, either.\n\nThis is a typically crude PG-13 comedy of today that does have it\u0027s funny moments but overall is low class. In this film, believe me, most of the skits were not funny and they are the usual sex jokes. Hollywood is obsessed with sex in its comedy movies. Hey, I can laugh at dumb humor with the best of \u0027em, and I\u0027ll laugh at good sex joke, too, but I couldn\u0027t find that many good sketches in here. That\u0027s the film really is, one sketch after another featuring Farley and/or Spade. This guys did better in \"Tommy Boy,\" but not much better. \n\nIt\u0027s these kind of films that give today\u0027s comedy films a bad name.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
