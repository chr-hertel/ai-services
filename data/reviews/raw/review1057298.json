This movie was made out to be the biggest blockbuster movie containing the Red Sox ever. In my opinion, IT FLOPPED BADLY. At no point in this movie did I laugh for an extended amount of time and the best part of the movie was watching the game. Jimmy Fallon was far from funny and Drew Barrymore is ..........nevermind. Anyway, I advise you see this if u get free tickets or sneak in free but do not pay. I bought tickets for this movie to try and sneak into Sin City, unfortunately I was caught and I was made to Fever Pitch. I was excited because it was a great back-up movie to see but they did a horrible job and the Farrely Brothers dropped a notch in my book.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
