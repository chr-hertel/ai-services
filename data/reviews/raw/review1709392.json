Tom Hanks is one of those versatile actors, not only can he go from a dramatic role in Saving Private Ryan to a romantic role in You\u0027ve Got Mail, but he can do comedy too.\n\nMeg Ryan, the Queen of Romance, stars alongside Tom Hanks. The chemistry between the two in the movie, you\u0027ll swear they are married in real life.\n\nThe writing and directing by Nora Ephron is tremendous once again. Here\u0027s a woman who can superbly write men while still knowing how to write the perfect woman.\n\nIt\u0027s great to see not only a predictable movie like this play out so well, but have also a large supporting cast to boot. Steve Zahn, Greg Kinnear, Jean Stapleton, Parker Posey, and Dave Chappelle provide the comedic relief when Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks are lost in each other\u0027s constant back and forth emailing.\n\nWhen you finally finish the movie, you\u0027ll feel warm, and satisfied. As if you just experienced all the love between them with the special someone you have or met.\n\nThis is definitely a movie you will not want to pass up. Even guys shouldn\u0027t pass up the chance to watch this one.\n\nWatch it and cuddle with your significant other as you do.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
