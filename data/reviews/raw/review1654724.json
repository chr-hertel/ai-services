Most of the action in this film is so hyper and it is just like the director stood right next to it and shook the camera around to make it seem insane. Im very tired of this type of filming. It really ruins movies for me nowadays. The setup dragged on a bit long and truthfully you don\u0027t see much of the infected except for a lot of running around. That being said however, there are some very killer moments in the last half that make up for all this.\n\nPOSSIBLE SPOILERS\n\nThe bombing and chemical weapon scenes were very cool. Their was a true intensity not seen in most horror movies today in these parts, and you really were not sure who would live and die. The nightvision gunscope scene was awesome. Very reminiscent of Blair Witch and The Descent, with a very serious tension I haven\u0027t felt in a while. And last but not least, the helicopter mutilation. The best death scene in any movie ever, period.\n\nEND POSSIBLE SPOILERS All in all it is worth the time and money to check this one out in the theater, but if there is a third, I truly hope they get rid of this shaky camera nonsense. I am aware it gives viewers the illusion if being straight in the mess, but i\u0027d rather just be able to tell what was going on. Good flick, check it out.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
