Even Co-Creator Stone was led to comment: \"A lot of people didn\u0027t get it. I didn\u0027t get it myself.\" And that\u0027s really because there was nothing to get. Essentially a one-joke pony (how much mileage did they really expect to get from retreading NY Times stories anyway?) it appears to have run out of steam before it left the storyboarding sessions. The usual, lamentable sitcom personalities and situations litter the 22 minute shows because there\u0027s nothing else to go in their places.\n\nThe envelope-pushing and complete disregard for any sacred cows that make South Park the most cutting satire since \"Married With Children\" signed off, simply isn\u0027t here.\n\nMatt and Trey definitely phoned this one in. What could have been a great opportunity to satirize the entire political culture, falls as flat as the dim-bulb jokes and the ad infinitum reminders of George W. Bush\u0027s alleged stupidity.\n\nBottom line: should have never gotten past the pitch session, let alone out of the development process. (It\u0027s impossible to believe this one tested well. Even if you don\u0027t like the President, you surely won\u0027t find this funny.) But Comedy Central has made its mark by taking chances on shows no one else would touch with a ten-foot poll. They can\u0027t all be \"South Park\"." }
