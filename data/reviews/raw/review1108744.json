Most films today have an \u0027artificial flavoring\u0027 added, but \u0027Gone\u0027s way different. I rented \u0027Gone\u0027 at Blockbuster and was truly impressed with the story.\n\nYes, the movie is based on the Book of Revelations, but so what? The new CBS series is based on \u0027Revelations\u0027, too. But \u0027Gone\u0027 was first and is definitely the most original of all the last days-type stories.\n\nThe acting could definitely be better and it\u0027s puzzling why the \u0027Survivor\u0027 guys were cast. The only rational was the type of movie this is which is that the last \u0027survivor\u0027 in the end of the world. Nevertheless, the film was well-directed and written and the locations in Southeast Asia were stellar.\n\nI would definitely recommend this film to anyone who has had a Christian upbringing because it is one searing and emotionally-charged movie that keeps you guessing to the last scene.\n\nAnother film I recommend, by the way, is \u0027Luther\u0027 with Joseph Fiennes as the star. I\u0027ll write an even lengthier review on that one. Great movie, too.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
