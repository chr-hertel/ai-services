I loved the characters in it, especially Lil. Lightning and Thunderbolt! They were awesome!\n\nMy favorite character in the entire movie was probably Lightning. He\u0027s one of my favorite, recent Disney villains, mainly because he has that evil way going on, and he also has a comical side (with some help from Thunderbolt) Observe;\n\nQuote;\n\nThunderbolt: They suck all the blood out of ya\u0027! Do ya\u0027 hear me, they suck all the blood out of you! \n\nHe is face to face with Lightning the entire time and when he finishes, Lightning falls on his back to the ground! Ha! Love the expressions on both their faces during the quote!\n\nI especially love the last scene Lightning\u0027s in at the end of the movie where Thunderbolt is distracting him! It was hilarious! You need to see this movie!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
