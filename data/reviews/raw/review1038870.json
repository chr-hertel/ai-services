It uses the technique of pixilation, therefore it straddles live action and animation. Basically, its stop motion but with humans. This gives the picture a very unique look. The film shows the slow walk of a projectionist through the city of Sydney, while his life plays out as projections on the walls around him.\n\nThe concept\u0027s good and it looks fabulous, but it doesn\u0027t do anything. The problem is there is no emotion. You can\u0027t connect with the character and therefore are unable to feel anything towards him, leaving you as an observer, and by the end it becomes monotonous.\n\nIf you can, see Famed, a previous Michael Bates pixilation work, and a much more emotive and stunning piece.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
