Anybody who hasn\u0027t seen this series should buy a copy, that is if you can find one! It\u0027s got everything from the opening sequence with it\u0027s suspense laden theme tune, tense scene breaks all the way through to the final credits. If you haven\u0027t already fallen off the edge of the sofa you\u0027ll be crying out for the next episode to come on. Sadly I\u0027m not related unlike lucky Franco below but I do know somebody who shares the same birthday, a few years apart mind!\n\nForget Star Trek and those men dressed in tights! this is the real deal, Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent was based in the present day not some dodgy set in space!\n\nThe Invaders - Alien beings from a dying planet Â– this would still bring in the ratings even now!" }
