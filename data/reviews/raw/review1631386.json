It\u0027s literally an explosive beginning, with Zito coming out of the scenario in medium rare condition.\n\nWhen Zito\u0027s run of bad luck continues and he finds his home burned to the ground, he moves in with his partner Switek and his girlfriend, Darlene.\n\nThe chaos continues when the madcap Neville \u0027Noogie\u0027 Lamont and eccentric Izzy Moreno enter the scene. Noogie\u0027s expression as he watches his wife-to-be, Ample Annie, is priceless.\n\nCapably directed by Rob Cohen, this is a great episode. There are many memorable moments, including the most amusing henchmen I\u0027ve ever seen in a cop drama.\n\nWhen the show was originally aired, I used to dislike the hard-hitting drama being interrupted by these comic interludes. Time has passed and I now really appreciate the change of pace these episodes introduce.\n\n9 out of 10.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
