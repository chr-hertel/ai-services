The film was released in 1971 in a time in which everything was changing fast, so \"Klute\" doesn\u0027t pass judgement or try to deliver any moral message.\n\nSimply told the story runs like this: \"A detective, Klute (Donald Sutherland) is engaged to find a man, Tom Gruneman, that disappeared mysteriously. No one knows if he\u0027s dead or alive. The only link Klute has is Bree (Jane Fonda), a high class hooker that apparently Tom Gruneman was frequenting before his disappearance. Klute goes to see her. His investigations progress but soon it\u0027s clear that someone is after Bree\u0027s life.\" \n\nI think that in spite of its sophistication, \"Klute\" falls short. It doesn\u0027t work as a thriller and it hasn\u0027t really involved me. The film is good, but the detached look that Pakula gives to characters and places, makes the film lose the emotional impact it could have had if it had a more personal touch.\n\n\"Klute\" seems to be a film that was carefully planned and executed. Pakula is a good director - visually \"Klute\" is a beautiful film, and it is also an interesting period piece (better anyway than the majority of thrillers made nowadays), and Jane Fonda is very good as Bree - it\u0027s thanks to her that \"Klute\" managed to keep my interest.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
