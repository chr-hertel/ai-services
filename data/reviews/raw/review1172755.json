At least in Spain. Teenagers in high school aren\u0027t supposed to be living on their own when they are 16-18 years old. And furthermore the actors were mostly older than the character they were representing.\n\nBut anyway, this series was made to be watched by teenager, and as a teenager I loved that series. The argument treated topics that were useful for teenagers to learn about, like drugs, teen pregnancy or violence, and reflected a reality in which teens would like to live. That\u0027s what made the series so attractive and addictive.\n\nTo sum up, it was a series that a lot of Spanish teens will never forget." }
