Okay, the Black and Tans must have been horrific, but what about the Republicans? It\u0027s just that we only see one side of the story in this film, just totally biased.\n\nBlack and Tans are shown pillaging the villages around Cork, wanton destruction and the like. It is just too one-sided, like a Tom and Jerry cartoon.\n\nOtherwise, the filming is fantastic, full of lush, green countryside, just like in Devon. The acting is superb, too.\n\nWorth watching, but not as good as Neil Jordan\u0027s Michael Collins. Too rural by half (not even any action in Cork city).", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
