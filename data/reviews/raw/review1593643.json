I am surprised Kidman agreed to it as her films are usually very good. The only decent character was Aunt Clara but the other members of the cast were terrible (including Kidman) and it looked like a low budget, non story line movie. Michael Cane was awful and the stunts were really non existence. I actually feel very cheated out of the money I spent paying for the DVD, It is nothing like the TV series folks so if you enjoyed that you will be terribly let down. Further I think Nicole Kidmans part was really low key with all of the male actors getting more to do than she did. I cannot understand how anyone could produce such a film without any resemblance to the TV series and then to use the TV series in the way that they did was awful - it just did not work. It was very slow to start and after 10 minutes my children gave up and went to bed.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
