I have no idea how many episodes they ran. The three (perhaps 4) I managed to catch featured, 1. Spaulding Gray, 2. Rosanna Arquette \u0026 David Byrne, 3. Steven Wright.\n\nI would love to own these on DVD. Smart, funny, ironic, biting...as if Kurt Vonnegutt had written a TV show!\n\nThey ran on the local PBS station and as a result never had a regular time spot. I\u0027ve tried searching for more information on the program but have turned up very little. \n\nI\u0027ll try to write a few more details in regard to the individual episodes soon." }
