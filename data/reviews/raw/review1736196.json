This is one of the few, if not the only film that has ever reduced me to tears. I have often asked myself would I put myself on the line for any of my friends? This film has helped me come up with the answer. I cannot even imagine how some of the scenes in this motion picture were filmed as they are so powerful and overwhelming in every respect. The first half of the film is long but necessary, and there are many amusing moments too which help the viewer to get to know the characters and what they are. I believe these were Robert De Niro\u0027s and Christopher Walken\u0027s finest moments and will never be surpassed. 11/10 every time from me.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
