But, i still enjoyed it. The acting is semi over the top, but this is a horror movie so i can\u0027t complain to much. The film starts off kind of cheesy and is saved by the humor of Ryan Reynolds. Of course his humor changes to a very creepy and good performance similar to Jack Nicholsan in The Shining. Mellisa George does a nice job of playing the distressed mother and wife, and has some pretty good scared facial expressions. The kids are OK but they seem like there reading off cue cards the whole movie. In the original film you didn\u0027t see the ghost and now the ghost are all over the place. The film have a semi stylized look as did Texas chainsaw massacre that kind of gives it a look that puts you in a semi dream like state. All in all the film was very typical, but is saved by Ryan and Mellisa\u0027s performances and a very clean and sleek look.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
