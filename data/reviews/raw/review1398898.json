There is more excitement and more racing. More action packed and none of the sexuality or strong language content which is really great if you have a young one watching it with you. The cars are great I\u0027m not really into cars but this movie I think changed that. I went and seen it last weekend at the Drive In and I am going to go see it again this weekend. That is how great it is. Lucas Black is awesome in it. He really has grown up since The War and Sling Blade. HHHHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!! I give it 20 thumbs up. I promise you will not be disappointed. Well I guess that is all I can really say about you will just have to go watch it for yourself and decide what you think about it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
