However, this apprehension soon turned into gentle amusement as the film got under way. Sandler is actually watchable in this flick; for the first time ever, I didn\u0027t want to jump out of my seat and punch him until he stopped. His performance was convincing and genuinely surprising. The film itself suffers from Leoni\u0027s voice, which reminded too much of metal being scratched. It is also too lingering on the sentimentality and could\u0027ve done with being a few minutes shorter. It\u0027s too lightweight to really get to grips with the issues of race and class that it raises, but then it is more about relationships. Other than this, it was quite funny in places; with Leachman\u0027s \u0027old woman\u0027 performance being a highlight. Paz Vega looks great and carries off her \u0027Florrrr\u0027 with aplomb... I suspect it\u0027ll get about 7/10 on the IMDb, but it\u0027s a 6/10 for me.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
