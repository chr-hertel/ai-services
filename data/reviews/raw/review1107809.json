But with age it seems to me to be a bit more. the age of the characters demand that a been there done that mindset be adopted for the viewing. the director, coming fresh from a music video background into his first feature let\u0027s the material work without the gloss and just a well placed touch of guilty fun. It would be simple to say it\u0027s just a good film stopped from being placed into a more accomplished category because it\u0027s style at first glance seems to frame it with that English \u0027trainspoting thru two barrels\u0027 shaggy dog genre that many have come to expect as it\u0027s intention. Of course anyone seeing the film knows this not to be the case but i point it out because how exactly when making up your mind about this feature do you shelve it? For me at least i have come to give it a more unique classification. have a glass of wine and give it another play. Let me rephrase that ... let it play and go along for the ride.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
