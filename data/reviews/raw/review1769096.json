It makes me sick that people can\u0027t appreciate a well-made film that makes an important statement, and would rather write it off as a film that \u0027hurts the troops.\u0027 I watched this earlier and I came on IMDb to rate it, like I do after every film I see - and I was absolutely SHOCKED to see the rating so low. Especially for a newer film - those usually end up between 7 and 8, and if they get mixed reviews, maybe around 6.5 - but a 5.7? SEE this film, it is fascinating - and it will provoke a reaction from you, as great film-making should. It\u0027s not flawless, but it has important things to say for all those who aren\u0027t plugging their fingers in their ears and humming the entire time.\n\nBill O\u0027Reilly, I don\u0027t mind if you wanna argue with Michael Moore or something - but you stay away from movies, you\u0027re out of your element and as usual, you\u0027re likely to do more harm than good. I think now would be a good time to remember that he called \"Bourne Ultimatum\" an \u0027anti-American\u0027 film. Think about that. I can\u0027t stress this enough, see this absolutely fantastic film - arguably the best De Palma\u0027s made in over a decade.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
