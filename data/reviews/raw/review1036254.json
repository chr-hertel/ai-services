This vehicle for the grand old warhorse Marjorie Main features some of the Golden Age\u0027s greatest character actors and the talented and beautiful (if ultimately tragic) Susan Peters. But the sub-sitcom setups, rotten writing, inferior direction and editing, and at least one perverse (if not sickening) plot turn make this an unintentionally creepy little \"B\" picture indeed.\n\n\"Tish\" was no doubt a tryout for the dazzling Peters (who the same year would appear to far greater effect in \"Random Harvest\"), but given how short her film resume is, it\u0027s a shame that this thing has to feature so prominently on it.\n\nIf you need proof that MGM didn\u0027t turn out \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" and \"Mrs. Miniver\" twice a week, seek no more." }
