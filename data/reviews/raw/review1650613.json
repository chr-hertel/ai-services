I give it a good rating because I thoroughly enjoyed the film. This one is no exception.\n\nHowever, I also note some of the things that I didn\u0027t like about the film. This one is no exception for this part as well. Here\u0027s what I have to say about Spider-Man 3.\n\nI liked the characters, particularly Harry. Peter got on my nerves quite a few times throughout this film, which may have been one of Sam Raimi\u0027s intentions when he filmed the movie. I felt really bad for M.J., whose life is just not going right in this film. Harry was my favorite character. I liked how they finally went back to his nicer personality from the first film. I felt bad for him as well, especially at the end (won\u0027t spoil it for anyone who hasn\u0027t seen the movie and wants to). Flint Marko was an interesting character. A man who is only trying to save and protect his daughter but can\u0027t make that happen due to mistakes that get him in trouble with the cops. Eddie Brock Jr. was also an interesting character. You feel bad for him at first, but then he becomes Venom and you lose all sympathy for him. But he still manages to be a cool character.\n\nThe story was filled with tough moments for many characters. There are certain scenes that got way over-the-top with Peter\u0027s character when he allows his more confident side to get the best of him. You might even despise him. They also leave us hanging with Venom (who I hope will be in the fourth movie). I didn\u0027t like the ending very much. Very sad, but it also wasn\u0027t the traditional Spider-Man movie ending. I did like that Sandman has a possible future in the movies.\n\nOverall, this was a good, entertaining film, but it\u0027s also quite a disappointment. Don\u0027t expect this to be the best installment of the franchise. Even I have to admit, it\u0027s not. Try to enjoy it though.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
