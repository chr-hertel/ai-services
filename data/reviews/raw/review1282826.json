But till the end of the bombing of PH it is a fairly good watch, especially if you\u0027ve got one of those larger screen, it comes up quite neat. I had a little trouble to spot John Voight and did need midb to confirm he was... well by process of elimination I actually got it right. \n\nI did not mind either the romantic side of it, the improbable situation was a little uneasy to accept for me although I admit in such a mess as a war lot of things are possible and reality at time may surpass fiction. My last remark is about the second entry, I think (jan 2003), Some guy from London must have had in mind to dazzle other readers with his summary in French. I can assure you it does not make any sense and it\u0027s just as well because if it did and was offensive, it seems the moderator would have missed it." }
