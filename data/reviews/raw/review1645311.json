From start till the end, the twists in the movie sustains interest and toward the second half, the movie gets really exciting. Most of the movies have one or more bloopers which totally ruins the fun, however, I didn\u0027t find any widely visible mistake in this one. The movie is neither suspense nor horror.. so those who are hoping to find any suspense or horror may be disappointed. But if those who are looking out for some good time pass.. this movie will keep you occupied. The movie displays ample of violent scenes.. so \"mind you\" if you are watching with children.\n\nThats all you need to know.. Enjoy!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
