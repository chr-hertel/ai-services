Adam Sander is a funny guy and shows that yet again in this film, he provides good laughs and good humour, though the humour isn\u0027t to everyones taste as may offend some people it is a good laugh if you don\u0027t follow the storyline too strictly. all the cast are good as their roles and all provide the need laugh that makes the film great.\n\nthose that are easily offended don\u0027t watch it as you will be upset by the content but those who are Sandler fans or love a good laugh you will love it.\n\ni wouldn\u0027t give my copy of it up for anyone.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
