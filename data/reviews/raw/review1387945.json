This was one of the finest shows, of any genre, that I have ever seen. I am a 54 year old Canadian male and I was moved to tears as Mr. Harper deals with Billy, via flashbacks, showing us the evolution of tough street kid to a young man whose thoughts look to a future that was prematurely ended in the craziness called Iraq. When Mr. Harper reads Billys\u0027 letter; the warmth, love and respect that Billy shows to a man that cared enough comes through and the tears Mr. Harper shed was the same feelings I felt. Bravo to the writers of this show and Bravo to Chi Mcbride on a performance that was em-my worthy.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
