Alain Robak clearly is such an enthusiast filmmaker and his \"Baby Blood\" is a hugely entertaining and cheerful splatterfest, despite the poor and inept screenplay. The relatively unknown but impressively voluptuous Emmanuelle Escourrou (what\u0027s in a name) stars as the unhappy fianc√©e of a circus artist who gets impregnated by a parasite that burst out a newly imported cheetah. The fetus growing inside Yanka is pure evil and demands her to kill men so that it can feed on their blood. This results in some of the most over-the-top bloody and sadistic massacres ever shot on film, with cut off heads, slit throats and many outrageous knife-attacks. Of course, this exaggerated amount of bloodshed makes it all blackly comical and \"Baby Blood\" therefore shouldn\u0027t be taken too seriously. This isn\u0027t the fist horror film handling about ferocious fetuses/infants (there\u0027s also \"It\u0027s Alive\", \"I don\u0027t want to be Born\" and even the premise of \"Rosemary\u0027s Baby\" is remotely similar) but \"Baby Blood\" is much more creative and tongue-in-cheek than anything you\u0027ve ever seen before. The camera-work is quite nifty and there are several cameos of eminent Frenchmen, like Jacques Audiard (director of \"Read My Lips\") and Alain Chabat (who played Caesar in \"Asterix\"). The script is very man-unfriendly, which is quite a new approach for exploitation! Nearly every male is presented as a weak and imbecile creature whereas Yanka gets stronger with every murder she commits. \"Baby Blood\" is ingenious, somewhat bizarre horror fun.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
