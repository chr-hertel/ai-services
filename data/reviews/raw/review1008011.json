Wooden acting from Garner, who in this movie looks a lot like a guy. My friend was like \"Who is that ugggly guy\" and I\u0027m like \"Hey that is actually the star of the movie, this chick Elektra who\u0027s supposed to be sexy\" and she laughed for an hour after that. Totally contrived love story, with of course a stupid kid to act as a barrier to the plot. This is the worst comic book movies get, I saw Catwoman and I can\u0027t say much for it but I could say that it\u0027s better than this one. What a waste of my 5 dollars, I knew it would be bad going into it and it was bad walking out of it. It was so bad that I was bored and thinking about the things I could be doing that I wasn\u0027t because I was stuck in the theatre watching this hokey movie. Does anyone remember the days when they did comic book movies GOOD?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
