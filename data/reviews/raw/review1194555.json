Orlando Bloom can actually act and he and Kirsten Dunst have great chemistry. Susan Sarandon is wonderful as the mother and the memorial scene is touching and memorable. It\u0027s a story about love, friendship, death and most of all ... life. A fantastic soundtrack, as in most Cameron Crowe films. For the critics giving this movie terrible reviews, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s fair to review a movie in comparison to other movies from the same director. A movie should be reviewed according to how it stands up on its own. The movie resonates and stays with you days after ... it\u0027s the feel-good movie of the year! Since my friends and I walked out of the cinema, we have been discussing the movie and it seems to get better the more we think about it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
