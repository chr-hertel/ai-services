I mean, there always have been geniuses in Russian cinema, but one cannot live on caviar - needs daily bread, too. This action shows a young professional boxer who loses his vision and then must save the world and his love. And blind he does. I would like to invite visitors to see pictures from the movie and watch a detailed trailer at RussArt.com. Those who read Russian can find more materials useful: reviews, actor biographies, articles, etc.\n\nPictures: http://russart.com/?moviepictures\u0026mid\u003d247 .\n\nTrailer: http://russart.com/?movietrailer\u0026mid\u003d247 .", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
