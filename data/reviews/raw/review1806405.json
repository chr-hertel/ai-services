I do not understand why we need to criticize the story really happened, fear the reality? I do not know who say, is a film vedibile. Cmq I am tired of reading your stupid opinions, this is a zoo, a caravanserai, here anyone can write what he wants, I bet that you have put Rambo 10 but goes. Write what you want, ultimately each of us is to judge what he wants. Even the most ignorant and illiterate, have made a miserable 7 titanic. Goodbye!
