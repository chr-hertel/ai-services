He used to have a top R\u0026B countdown show called \"On The Move\" that played on 93.7 WBLK on Sundays in the late \u002780s. He was known in the radio industry as being \"The Fly Jock\", because he used to fly from Chicago to L.A. to do his radio shows. The \"Tom Joyner Show\" is a departure from his radio roots. It\u0027s an hour comedy/variety show, which you don\u0027t really see on TV much anymore. The show consisted of various music acts, comedy skits, stand-up comedy, and a talent show. It was an enjoyable way to spend an hour when it was on. I used to catch it on WKBW, channel 7 from Buffalo, late on Saturday nights. It has disappeared from their schedule, unfortunately. I always enjoyed the music acts that he had on his show. Artists like Keith Sweat, Shanice, and Ginuwine were music acts that come to mind as I am writing this. The talent show segment was a lot of fun to watch too. It was a grab bag of different acts like dancers, musicians, magicians and so on. All and all, this show was really good, and I hope that it comes back into my area for broadcast again!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
