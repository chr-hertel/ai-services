What happened to the age when we all read and studied for ourselves, rather than listening to the corner gossips, which is all this \"work\" amounts to.\n\nThis is so over-christianized that it takes itself so seriously as to attempt to beat their ugly lies into anyone who would dare watch.\n\nThis was a complete lie. The only thing they got right were the names of those involved.\n\nThis was just sad.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t rate a rating.\n\nthe Fiend :.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
