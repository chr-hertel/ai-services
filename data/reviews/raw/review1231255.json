In 1997, war hero-turned-convict Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is hired to rescue the president (Donald Pleasance) from New York City, now a maximum security prison (to accommodate the crime wave that swept the country in 1988).\n\nThis is certainly one cool movie. Wearing an eye-patch, Kurt Russell looks like the ultimate bad-ass. And mark my words, that\u0027s exactly what Snake is. As for New York as a maximum security prison: it\u0027s any bad mother****er\u0027s wet dream. And the other cast members: Isaac Hayes (yes, the \"Shaft\" singer and Chef on \"South Park\") plays the Duke, who is in complete control of the Big Apple; Ernest Borgnine plays Cabbie, who knows exactly how to survive in this most dangerous land; Harry Dean Stanton plays Brain, one of Snake\u0027s former acquaintances; and Adrienne Barbeau plays Maggie, Brain\u0027s hubby.\n\nOh, and I noted that there\u0027s a pizzeria here in Portland called Escape from New York. It\u0027s located on NW 23rd St, if you ever come to Portland.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
