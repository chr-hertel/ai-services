The DVD is a long time coming but hopefully when it does it will have tons of extras (as it the current footage isn\u0027t long enough) and do justice to a great band. This documentary is very special as it chronicled The Police when they were the very first band of the 80s to do a true world tour. In fact the concerts in Greece were the first since the early 70s when the Rolling Stones played there and were allegedly \u0027beaten up and jailed\u0027. The footage of India is awesome as they were probably the first or one of the first Western bands to play there and the emotions of the audience are very natural and a joy to watch. Come on get this out on DVD....", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
