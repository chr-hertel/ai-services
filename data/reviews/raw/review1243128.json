De Vito has brought us a disturbing but never uninteresting comedy, full of funny and perverse situations, not to mention some of the most interesting camera-work I have seen in a comedy in quite awhile. Yes, the depths that this couple sink to are a little hard to swallow, but the film requires you to put your brain on check and let dramatic license have its freedom and if you can do this, there are rewards to be had here. Douglas and Turner work very hard at their roles and De Vito is equally effective on screen as the lawyer caught between the Roses. There are a lot of funny moments in this film but there are moments of bleakness and sadness that stay with you long after the credits roll. Though it\u0027s not an easy watch, THE WAR OF THE ROSES is worth seeing for its jaundiced view of marriage and divorce as seen through the demented eyes of Danny De Vito.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
