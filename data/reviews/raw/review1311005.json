The film that arrived, however, was Going Postal (1998), a.k.a. Postal Worker, which is something altogether different. In a brief check of half a dozen video stores on the Web and a search on eBay, I discovered that every DVD for sale was the 1998 film, directed by Jeffrey F. Jackson, and nobody seemed to have the 1998 film, written and directed by Beverly Allyn Chase--which, of course, is the one I wanted. The earlier comment on this film is obviously for the 1998 release, and IMDb has the wrong box art for the 1999 release. Very strange." }
