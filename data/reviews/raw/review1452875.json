I got a kick out of spending Saturday evening there.\n\nthe one thing that I have been trying to figure out ever since the buzz about SoaP started is this: Why did they have the plane originate in HAWAII? Last place on earth that this could happen. there are NO snakes in Hawaii. None in the zoo, none are native, none are allowed to be brought in (legally), hopefully, none kept as pets. Snakes are not even allowed to be transported through any Hawaii airport! So why do these snakes appear on a flight that was supposed to originate in Hawaii? the writers could have chosen about ANYWHERE ELSE. Why pick the one airport LEAST likely to have any snakes?\n\nIf it hadn\u0027t been for that stupid error, SoaP would have been 9/10. aloha", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
