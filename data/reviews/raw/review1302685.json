He heads to Los Angles where he turns up at an opera. It\u0027s not long before people start being murdered though and Gravelle is the chief suspect but as always in these movies, the murderer is the least person you would expect... Charlie Chan and his No1 son help with the investigation.\n\nWe also get to see Boris singing in this (if it is his voice) and also includes the opera \"Carnival\".\n\nJoining Boris in the cast is Warner Orland as Charlie, Keye Luke, Margaret Irving and Guy Usher (The Devil Bat).\n\nCharlie Chan At the Opera is a must for all fans of Chan and Boris Karloff. Excellent.\n\nRating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
