In \"A Time for Love,\" the best and sweetest segment, a soldier and a pool hall hostess strike up a timid and shy romance; in \"A Time for Freedom,\" a brothel madame yearns for a political activist for whom she\u0027s not allowed to articulate her feelings; and in \"A Time for Youth\" angst-filled 20 somethings navigate the tricky waters of both same-sex and opposite-sex relationships.\n\nAll of the segments focus more on the female characters than they do the males, especially the second and third. The director uses clever devices to tie the three segments together, like the use of letters as the primary method of communication in the first and second segments, which morphs into cell phones and e-mails in the third. The whole movie has a languorous feel, as if the director is in no hurry to tell his story. However, this makes the movie feel unnecessarily long, especially given the slight plots that the three segments anchor themselves around. Indeed, the first segment is so touching and poignant, that the final two left me somewhat cold.\n\nAn interesting Taiwanese film that\u0027s worth a look, but not an unequivocal success.\n\nGrade: B", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
