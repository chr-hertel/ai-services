It moves briskly and is well acted, especially by Grant Mitchell as John Quincy Adams and Sidney Blackmer as Teddy Roosevelt. Nanette Fabray \u0026 George Reeves very briefly portray young lovers caught up in history\u0027s flow.\n\nOften overlooked or neglected today, the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents, both in front \u0026 behind the camera. The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film, something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel. Economical to produce in terms of both budget \u0026 schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material, short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios\u0027 feature films.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
