I\u0027ve been to all the festivals and this was one of the better looking films. Craig must of spent a lot of time with the Director of Photography to capture such stunning images. Craigs a genius up and coming director! This is what independent film making is all about. I really enjoyed Brandons wonderful performance also. Another rising star Craig as found as director. Brandon was really put through the ringer in this role. Their were a couple of bit actors that stood out also. David Durando and Chris Conatey. Small roles, but brilliant! One can only hope that Craig keeps the magic of this team together and comes up with another film to shoot. Hopefully the next one will be a feature! Nice work guys and gals of \"keeping up with the Jonesers\"! Great fun!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
