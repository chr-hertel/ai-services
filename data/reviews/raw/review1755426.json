I cannot recall another film about a real person that captured so totally what it might have felt like to be that person and to understand what drove him. I recommend this film to anyone interested in film as an incredible medium for character study. Perhaps this can best, if not only, be accomplished by writer/directors like Ingmar Bergman. In this instance, Alexander Barnett as writer/director/actor has also succeeded beautifully in reincarnating Vincent van Gogh as a being compelled to work, to express himself and his thoughts, to live fully - not as a victim, but heroic in his battle to survive.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
