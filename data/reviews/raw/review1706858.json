One, it was filmed around where I grew up as a teen. (Big Sur and Santa Cruz) and two, yes, I will admit, for a crush on one of the actors, Jensen Ackles. But I walked away, having crushes on ALL the characters and more invested in the story lines that had nothing to do with Mr. Ackles. (Not to take anything away from the guy; he is quite at his best here with comedy and sincerity.) There is layers to this movie and about 4 story lines going on. From a girl looking to reclaim the relationship of a daughter she gave away as a teenager to an aging hippie in love with the Wiccan beauty across from the sub shop, to the more current love hook up of online dating to a sexpot who might settle for the last guy she ever thought to give her heart to, you are never bored! This movie made me laugh, a lot! With great dialogue and witty moments; everything- the actors, writer, and directors- were at their very best. For a movie that was only made in a few short weeks, and limited takes, that is saying something. Don\u0027t be fooled by the pretty people, they truly deliver and you can\u0027t help but lose your heart and relate to them and their stories. There are also some very touching tears brimming your eyes moments. Clea Duvall, I believe, has one of the most heart felt moment wrapping up the end of her story. Elisabeth Harnois holds the other heart wrenching moment of the movie as well. Jensen Ackles is the comedic relief and his T -shirts alone, get a chuckle of their own. Sean Patrick Flanery has a little smaller role but is still very engaging and makes you wonder why this guy doesn\u0027t get more work. Finally, Danneel Harris, our sexpot finding her heart of gold, delivers a delicious performance. So, why is this movie not playing in a theater near you? I don\u0027t know. What I do know is that Hollywood, rumored to be a \u0027risk taker\u0027 is playing it too damn safe with their money sucking sequels and not realizing that, yes, the public likes those movies, but we also want something richly fulfilling and with a meaty heart. I hope that Ten Inch Hero gets a chance to share its flavor with the public; its the best remedy to those CRAVING for something with the perfect amount of humor and heart.
