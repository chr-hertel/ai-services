Gregg Araki directed the film beautifully and handled the subject matter very well. I don\u0027t know how a national audience will respond to the film because of the subject matter, but it\u0027s such an intelligently done film. I highly recommend this movie.\n\nThe entire cast, Gregg Araki, and Scott Haim were all present for the Q \u0026 A session afterward. It was interesting to see how much Haim appreciated that Araki stuck as closely to his novel as possible. He also shared an interesting anecdote about an older woman\u0027s responses to the book.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
