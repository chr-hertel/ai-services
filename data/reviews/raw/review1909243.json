McClean starts off with a lie stating that the film is based on true events. The characters are introduced and for the entire first hour the director tries to portray them realistically so that the audience sympathizes with the them when their fates are eventually met. It moves at a lethargic pace after the first half hour. Then after about 45 minutes, for some unexplained reason, their car and watches stop functioning and the villain makes his appearance. Then the last half hour becomes sort of a snuff film (as expected from this kind of movie) with lots of torture, rape, dismantling etc. Of course, there are some plot holes too. That Liz character is incredibly stupid. She has a chance of killing the villain but all she does is hit him till he\u0027s unconscious. What was she thinking? Of course he\u0027ll be back in no time to get her. He\u0027s got military training. The shaky hand-held camera-work is overdone and the acting is mediocre at best. But, what really (perhaps the only things that) stands out are the amazing visuals. The Australian landscape is breathtaking and looking at it just wants you to be there. So beautiful are they that I could care less about the rest. Anyway, \u0027Wolf Creek\u0027 has nothing new to offer except for the landscape shots (but you can watch travel documentaries to see them)." }
