The story is set in Medieval Europe. The first time I saw this was on Netflix. It was the Not Rated Version. I\u0027ve never seen this movie cut.I am going to get this movie on video and hopefully it will be the cut version. Flesh + Blood was cut to avoid an X rating It was cut. My book The Cutting Room Floor says Paul Verhoeven had to go back to the MPAA about three or four times. This is a explicit movie but no where near Basic Instinct. I think Rutger Hauer did an excellent performance as Martin. The cinematography is great, the sets are great, and the acting is great. Jennifer Jason Leigh does a good job as Agnes." }
