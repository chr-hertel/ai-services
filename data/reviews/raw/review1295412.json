Jim is home in Gloribee, and is intent on capturing a black stallion, but his past catches up with him when a man he put into prison is released and seeks vengeance.\n\nRobertson is supported by some well-known male faces, including George Kennedy in an early role, with Rod Cameron impressing the most as the \"good bad guy\". Other characters, including several female ones, come from the TV series and are a bit superficial in contrast.\n\nCross-checking by clicking on George Kennedy in the cast list shows that this film was also known as \"Assignment in Gloribee\".\n\nI was surprised that this film had a marking of 7.8 out of 10; it\u0027s OK but not that good.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
