Everyone has opinions and on the \"O\u0027Reilly Factor\" opinions are flying all over the place. Mr. O\u0027Reilly has his opinions and his guests theirs. He confronts his guests and elicits responses. What makes this formula effective is that Mr. O\u0027Reilly pulls no punches and gives his guests ample opportunity to respond, leading to interesting and revealing exchanges of opinions on a wide variety of controversial topics. Also. Bill O\u0027Reilly doesn\u0027t duck anyone, and on every show presents his views and invites comment. This format gives \"The Factor\" credibility and is therefore a news program that should be watched.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
