Considering it has been awhile since I saw it last (then I recently rented it). George Kennedy is the main character, and is rather creepy in this movie.\n\nIt is definitely worth viewing. The set of an abandoned Nazi ship conjures up the torture chambers and murder which occurred there. There are also some strange sound effects, the voices he hears remind one of what the gas chambers must have sounded like. The ship itself is a nightmare, and the acting is plausible.\n\nIf you have seen the recent \"Ghost Ship\", with Gabriel Byrne and Ron Eldard, rent this film, It is a lot more frightening with a better story to it. 7/10.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
