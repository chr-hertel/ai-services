At the time, the \"Chinese Exclusion Act\" was in force, and they were not entitled to immigrate for permanent residence, but could be used for short terms, and then sent home. Thus, the treatment of the women shown in the film was legal, if not moral. The film shows how people of good moral character can defeat the aims of those who took advantage of the \"Act\". There is a lot of fact and accuracy in the movie, and it has gained a lot from the recent research into the real \"Old West\", not the \"Hollywood West\".\n\nIt runs for four hours, and it is well worth viewing.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
