The movie as a whole tends to lack the fun loving attitude he had in previous movies like God of Cookery and Shoalin Soccer. What we get instead is a pretty darkly humored, violent film that tries to illustrate what The Untouchables would have looked like if Robin Williams and Jim Carrey were on the marquis. In short, it seems awkward.\n\nBut hen again, that was most likely Chow\u0027s intent, taking a page from American cinema so the violence might seem more accessible. What I really did like were the scenes with the assassins which really embodied the more classic elements of Asian cinema and Chow\u0027s own wild vision. I was also pleased to see Kwok Cheun Chan had a better role this time around, considering he was my favorite character from Shoalin Soccer in the role as Empty Hand. \n\nTake this movie for what it is, and you\u0027ll enjoy it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
