It opens up pretty good but then gets sort of slow with all the stuff happening to the guy whose name I cant remember. Once you see what is going on on the ship it gets pretty entertaining. The acting wasn\u0027t too great nor was the cgi but it was entertaining.\n\nIf you want to watch a monster movie with good acting and creepy creatures then you\u0027ll have to look elsewhere. I think only the mad doctor was doing good (He was believable). You cant only watch the ending for entertainment, you\u0027ll have to watch the whole thing to understand the end. See it, don\u0027t love it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
