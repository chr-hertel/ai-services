Make no mistake: this is another fine entry in the saga and a good film in itself, but it just does not throw a punch like the first two films. It is very slow moving throughout, which is not necessarily a bad thing, however the purpose of the pace is a bit ambiguous, and in addition the events and characters are not all clearly defined. It still has very interesting individual ideas, some good cinematography and lighting, plus there is a lot of attention paid to sound. There is quite a bit to take out of it, but I personally found more to take out of \u0027Bleu\u0027 and \u0027Blanc\u0027.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
