Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) keeps his work and private life separate. However, when these two worlds unintentionally collide resulting in the murder of his wife and son, he decides he has to revenge the crime whilst protecting his remaining son Michael Jr. from the mob. The title of the film, \u0027Road to Perdition\u0027, symbolises the path that the father is travelling along towards his damnation since the word \u0027Perdition\u0027 denotes hell, where the soul is damned for eternity.\n\nThe main theme explored by director Sam Mendes, is the relationship between father and son. Mendes develops the theme of parental protection through this relationship and the fact that a parent will do anything to protect their child and keep them safe from harm. A scene that visually represents this theme is when Michael Sr. covers up his gun with his coat to prevent his son from getting a good look at it.\n\nMendes also explores this theme from the viewpoint of his son. Michael Jr. respects his father and this is depicted in a scene at the start of the film when, instead of entering his father\u0027s room, he remains at a distance on the upstairs landing in order to ask his father to come to dinner. This respect is further reinforced through the dialogue when Michael addresses his father as \u0027Sir\u0027.\n\nThe image of the good and moral man that Michael Jr. had believed his father to be is shattered when he discovers what his father does for a living. Michael Sr. tells his son never to tell anyone what he has witnessed and this authority is emphasised by the camera adopting Michael Jr.\u0027s point of view at a low angle. However, the need for Michael Jr. to continue to have a morally righteous father figure is symbolised by him reading a Lone Ranger comic book, where the Lone Ranger represents the perfect moral role model; righteous and just and which is in contrast to how he now views his own father.\n\nThe acting in \u0027Road to Perdition\u0027 includes some strong performances, with Tom Hanks and Paul Newman standing out as Michael Sullivan and John Rooney respectively. The editing is visually representative of the collision of two worlds and is achieved through the use of crosscutting which works to good effect.\n\nThe music used in \u0027Road to Perdition\u0027 is classical and therefore for the most part un-intrusive, which allows the audience to concentrate on the well-constructed narrative. The only time the soundtrack is noticeable is when it switches from non-diegetic to diegetic and an example of this switch is when Michael Sullivan is playing a duet on the piano with John Rooney.\n\n\u0027Road To Perdition\u0027 has a well-crafted narrative, exploring themes that strike a cord with every member of the audience, and is a testament to the tender direction of Sam Mendes and the superb acting of Tom Hanks and Paul Newman.\n\n8/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
