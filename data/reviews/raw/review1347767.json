With a brilliant direction, visually astonishing (with and indie look) and a great performance by the hand of Adam Sandler, you will literally fall in love with this movie. The characters are so unique (like every Anderson\u0027s character), Sandler character is like a modern Dr. Jekyll and Mr. hide, who portraits his anger in a unique form. This movie explores a lot about human mind, the path to monstrosity and love feelings. A must see! 10/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
