In fact, I think he was the model for Jeff Goldblum in the much bigger Independence Day from the same producer team. Kurt Russel was also OK as the military stereotype.\n\nBut like i said, this is Hollywood at its formulaic best.\n\nWorth a watch", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
