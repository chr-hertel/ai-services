I am open minded though, and I never thought I\u0027d see the day when I would call a film bad because it offended my morals. But that day did come: the day I saw \"The Devil\u0027s Rejects.\" Not only does this film have major plot flaws (e.g., how the hell does the mutant-looking killer fit in with the story at all?), and has absolutely no scary moments at all, but it\u0027s entire premise is about as socially and ethically acceptable as a documentary expounding upon the delights of killing baby harp seals, or a song and dance number about the greatness of the Holocaust. The film literally advocates the torture and murder of other human beings. I can handle a movie where people are tortured and killed, don\u0027t get me wrong, for I have seen my fair share of Freddie/Halloween type movies, but never before have I run into a film that is obviously trying to tell the audience that the massive spilling of blood and screaming is a GOOD thing. I\u0027m no televangelist, mind you, in fact I\u0027m a Wiccan and a registered Libertarian, but this sort of thing just crosses the line. It\u0027s despicable.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
