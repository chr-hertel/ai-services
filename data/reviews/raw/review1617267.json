Even though I watched this movie over several days, it did not lose its message.\n\nThe movie starts out with Vincent being a god-child, de-gene-rate, Broken ladder, or in-valid. The way the writer uses the term in-valid is very clever because the word can also be pronounced in-va-lid (an infirm or sickly person). By being genetically inferior, vincent is discriminated against and can only get lesser jobs such as being a janitor. He pulls of one of the greatest underdog stories in movies (even greater than dodgeball). With an all-star cast such as this (Tony Shaloub, Alan Arkin, Uma Thurman) I am surprised that the movie did not get better ratings and recognition.\n\nEven though this is a Sci-fi movie it really does have a good plot and meaning, it really makes you think.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
