Zane Lamprey brings a level of dignity and humor to drunkenness that hasn\u0027t been seen since, dare I say it: Dean Martin. The Belgium episode is a must-see for any beer geek (like myself) and every episode provides you with an opportunity to drink, learn, be merry, and root Zane on as he journeys through yet another fascinating locale. He gets sauced, banters, zings, and even disturbs, but damn if he isn\u0027t the most likable guy you\u0027ll ever see on television. You\u0027ll never find a better drinking buddy. So grab a drink, get Steve McKenna\u0027d, and enjoy!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
