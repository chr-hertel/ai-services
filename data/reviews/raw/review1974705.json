In fact, there are no buildings involved at all: the gang\u0027s misadventures are all linked to a fateful subway ride.\n\nEach of the protagonists has to go someplace important, but as is often the case, the journey is more interesting and fun than the destination. Therefore we get Jerry meeting an overweight exhibitionist, Kramer hearing tips about a horse race, George skipping a job interview because he meets a woman and, most hilarious of the lot, Elaine missing a lesbian wedding due to a series of delays.\n\nThe key to the episode\u0027s success is, typically enough, the dialogue, like when Jerry talks to his fellow passenger (\"You have something against a naked body?\" \"I have something against yours!\") or George makes a brilliant statement about how he identifies certain women: \"I can always feel when lesbians are looking at me. They see me and think \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m not a heterosexual!\"\". This time, however, it\u0027s Lulia Louis-Dreyfus who steals the show with an outrageous combination of physicality (her exasperated facial expressions) and voice-over, the latter predating Arrested Development by eleven years for its use of bleeped cursing. That scene most certainly qualified as a shocker back in 1991, and it still stands out as a textbook moment of unsurpassed small-screen comedy.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
