The plot is complete and utter nonsense, but such is the case for nearly all members of the action/comedy genre. Within this film there are more than a few decent performances. Queen Latifah and Ann Margaret make solid and appealing contributions and Jimmy Fallon demonstrates what may eventually blossom into respectable talent. I\u0027m not exactly certain why this film suffered so severely at the hands of critics (perhaps the overnight fame of the SNL star, Fallon, has garnered resentment). That being said, this is more of a \"chuckle\" movie, as opposed to a \"laugh out loud\" film. I would, however, recommend it to anyone who is willing to set believability aside for a cute and lightly humorous joyride.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
