And then ... zombies attack! While the plot has interesting points, with some inspirations from other zombie flicks, it\u0027s fairly standard. The most interesting feature of the film is a fight between a shark and a zombie.\n\nWhat really bothers me about this film is the total lack of survival instinct in the characters. They seem utterly uninterested in their own survival, especially the females who most of the time just look at their impending doom, waiting for it to catch up with them. This is bad. And even worse, it removes any notion of \"suspension of disbelief\" from the film. And hence, the low grade.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
