Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro play some people whose lives get intertwined following a car wreck.\n\nA previous reviewer said that the movie\u0027s non-linear structure makes it somewhat confusing. I guess that it does a little bit, but that misses the overall point of the movie. The movie is showing the gut-wrenching existences that these people live. As it is, Penn\u0027s role here pretty much mirrors his role in \"Mystic River\".\n\nAll in all, it\u0027s a well done movie. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu gets down and dirty the same way that he did in \"Amores Perros\". I do recommend the movie, but I should warn you: don\u0027t expect anything light and fluffy.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
