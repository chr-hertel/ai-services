Haunted paint.", "reviewBody": "\"Conjurer\" is, in its own way, a triumph. It\u0027s difficult to find such an uncompromisingly boring film in any genre, much less horror. Sure, the film relies on all the same tropes as 99.9% of the \"haunted area\" pieces, but \"Conjurer\" really shines in its ability to cause fits of uncontrollable laughter and/or comas.\n\nShould you ever find yourself in the mood for a horror film that includes such terrifying elements as the discussion of paint swatches, the planting of cabbages, and healthy trees in broad daylight, \"Conjurer\" is just what you need.\n\nAlternately, you could read an issue of \"Better Homes \u0026 Gardens\".", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
