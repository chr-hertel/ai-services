I even gave it a lot of leeway because I figured since it was based on a comic there were things that made more sense in the comic itself. Then I found out from someone that there WAS NO COMIC! What a scam!! You don\u0027t make a movie like this, even showing comic book covers in the beginning, if it\u0027s NOT REALLY A COMIC! Man, after I heard that I really wanted my $10 back. Apart from a cool chase scene and a few visually, ahem, stimulating scenes, this is a complete waste of time.\n\nJovovich is kinda flat, too. I like the way the colors change and some of the shots are quite cool. But overall it didn\u0027t make a lot of sense and after the umpteenth scene with Violet killing hundreds of guys in the same way you just get bored. There was not even a lead up to a character who could REALLY challenge the hero. Why was she SO much better than everyone else? It\u0027s never explained. I guess I will have to read to comic to find out... oh WAIT! \n\nPhAZe", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
