Normally I can watch a bad movie all the way through. I could only watch halfway through, yes I choose to do laundry than finish watching this monstrosity. Don\u0027t waste your time or money, if you do, ask for it back!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
