Duma did the tick and we spent a wonderful evening together.\n\nThe characters are deep enough to make them credible and stimulating some thoughts: is Ripkuna good or bad? why does the buy run away from him? why does the boy fight with his mother?\n\nIt has beautiful images, a great story, leaves a strong message (growing, changing and leaving is part of life)...in short a wonderful movie.\n\nI am surprised that I had not heard of it at all before \"stumbling\" into it at the local DVD rental shop.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
