No need to cover the premise, as other reviewers have done so in detail. As a long-time sci-fi fan with a fondness for British made films, I expected a lot more from this than it delivered. As other reviewers note, the film does offer great atmosphere, reminiscent of the Quatermass films and other British sci-fi greats. Beyond that, it is a true mystery how others\u0027 can call this a \u0027gem\u0027. More like a lump of coal.\n\nThere is some interesting camera work in this black \u0026 white effort, and the acting is generally pretty good (although John Saxon was pretty dull, turning in a perfunctory performance at best). In spite of these positives, it doesn\u0027t take long to see that this film is very, very lame. Crummy special effects (the alien\u0027s \u0027claw hand\u0027 looks like it came from a Halloween shop), the makeup of the \u0027night caller\u0027 at the end was inconsistent with his appearance during the rest of the film (and lousy makeup at that), the premise of having an alien from Ganymede transporting to earth with money, a refined British accent and the ability to drive a car, rent an office, etc. is never explained, nor is the fate of the \u0027200 plus\u0027 girls abducted. The \u0027visitor\u0027 assures that they \u0027won\u0027t be harmed\u0027 but that\u0027s it. \n\nThis could have been a very good film. It certainly started out well enough, but as noted by others, the further into the film one got the worse it got. I felt cheated out of the 84 minutes I spent watching it. As a big fan of 50s and 60s sci-fi films, I\u0027m not too picky. There are many low-budget films of those eras and of that genre that are immensely entertaining. This is not one of them. \n\nAnd one final note: it would hardly be possible to find a more inappropriate title song for a science fiction film than the one used in this film. It was like something that might be used in a \u0027B\u0027 romance film, lyrics excepting. Awful. It nearly caused me to stop the film before it started. Regrettably, I sat through it all. Yawn.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
