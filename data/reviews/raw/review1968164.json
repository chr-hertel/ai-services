I did not go in with any expectations. It was one of the best horror films that I\u0027ve seen in a very long time and its memorable. Tobin Bell\u0027s acting was very good, once again. I think its better than saw 4, but not better than the others. Personally, i liked the concept of their not being too much blood and gore in this film. Furthermore, it one of the very few films that actually scared me, once i had left the theatre.\n\nOverall, you will like it if your a saw fan, or somebody who likes suspense films. Personally, i would see it again on DVD. However, if only go in for the blood and gore, then you will be very disappointed.\n\nI give this film 9.5/10.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
