We even have police officers threatening to strike in the u|k at the moment!! But the film is also so quotable and there are very strong performances - esp from Kurtwood smith \"Can you fly bobby!\"\n\nThe action scenes are spot on and the violent is very violent - which it should be... the other main star of this is Basil poledouris\u0027s music - it is fab and drives the films action and emotive scenes!! Rock on robo!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
