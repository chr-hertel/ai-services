Every sentence...exactly the same. Every expression...exactly the same. The real horror of this movie is she is one of the better actors. This movie goes beyond boring and it makes no sense. Her dad apparently got her the babysitting as punishment for going 800 minutes (if I remember correctly) on her cell phone for a boyfriend whom in my opinion was uglier than the actual killer. In fact at one point I thought her boyfriend was the killer. Apparently Jill is the only person who knows how to answer a damn phone because when she fears for her life her father doesn\u0027t answer, the people she\u0027s babysitting for don\u0027t answer, the maid doesn\u0027t answer, and even the \"mysterious son\" doesn\u0027t answer. Maybe she should take a lesson and not answer. The only person who does answer is the loser police officer who does nothing. Jill also get the award for WORST BABYSITTER EVER since the only time she checked on the kids (whom I was beginning wonder if they really existed)is when the psycho killer told her to. The final glimmer of hope to this mess would be the fact that Simon West somehow got Lance Henrickson to lend his voice as the killer, but apparently didn\u0027t want to shell out the extra $100.00 bucks to get him to appear in the movie. On a positive note, this is a good date movie because about 10 minutes in you will stop watching the movie and start making out with your significant other. Please avoid this bland movie, wait for the DVD or better yet Cable, or even better yet don\u0027t watch it at all.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
