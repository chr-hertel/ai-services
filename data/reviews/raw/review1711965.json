Although you hardly get a body shot half as good as Sagnier\u0027s lying by the pool, at least you have Bouyxou and Rollin in the credits, and that merely puts the film on a higher range of \"Worth Seeing\" than Swimming Pool (just find the caps of Sagnier and run). Now that would be a mistake to believe this film is worth seeing though, because it sucks except for that book editor called \"Du Genoux\". That\u0027s funny right ? But not enough to keep you awake. ONLY for Rollin fans, or diggers of pornography on film. Well, I know one, and I must thank him for the experience... but that\u0027s clearly not the film you wanna see if you\u0027d like to discover the hidden secrets of classic french pornography.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
