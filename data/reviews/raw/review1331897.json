I can say that it\u0027s not for everyone,because film is a little idiotic but that\u0027s the reason why I like it,why it\u0027s so funny and cool. I think acting is close to perfect,especially Jay and Bob and \"Jay\u0027s Rap\" in the beginning is very cool and funny.Maybe it\u0027s the only reason why I gave this film a try.\n\nAnd one more thing that amazes me is the presence of some actors that,in my opinion,are too \"serious\" for such a movie. For example Ben Affleck,Matt Damon,Jason Lee,Eliza Dushku,Seann William Scottand some others.\n\nIn the end I can say that this movie is \"must see\" for everyone who has good sense of humour and who wants to find the way to spend one hour and a half in gaiety and merriment", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
