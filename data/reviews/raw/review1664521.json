However, I am amazed to see how many people have put comments on here putting down the movie just because they want to defend Dungeons and Dragons.\n\nI had a friend that became very involved in Dungeons and Dragons and got VERY crazy from it. It was truly distressing to see the changes it brought about in him. I am not saying that everyone who plays the game gets this way, but I can definitely tell you that it happens and I have seen it happen. I think it\u0027s the creepiest game I have ever seen. One time I picked up a D\u0026D book at the store and opened it to a random page just to see what was there, and what I saw was instructions on how to possess another person\u0027s soul. I\u0027m sorry, but I don\u0027t find this entertaining or fun; I find this sick and psychologically and psychically dangerous.\n\nThere is no way for me to know what really happened in this murder case, but it does not surprise me that Dungeons and Dragons could be involved with something like this.\n\nThe acting was superb in this film. Even if you watch it as if it were a fiction and not based on a true story it is a good flick.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
