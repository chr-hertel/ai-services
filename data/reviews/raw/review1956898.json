This is certainly in the tradition of the 1946 heartbreak \"Brief Encounter.\"\n\nThis gem of a film deals with the ensuing custody battle between a couple and the wife\u0027s sister. The problem is that their third sister, the mother of the child, has died and the father, an alcoholic, is not capable of raising the child. We learn that at one time the father had a romantic interlude with his wealthy sister-in-law.\n\nThe little boy, Nicholas Gledhill,gives the most phenomenal performance. Interesting to read that this young lad has never appeared in another film. The cruelty that this child has to go through when he stays with his wealthy aunt-from the children from the private school that he attends. The film demonstrates how mean other children can be.\n\nThe film is so good because it shows two diverse sisters-one who is wealthy and the other, poverty stricken especially when her husband, a defeated candidate from the Labor Party, loses his job.\n\nThe musical score is fabulous and absolutely haunting. The ending will tug at your heart with its Titanic like tragic occurrence.\n\nThis is a memorable film, well told.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
