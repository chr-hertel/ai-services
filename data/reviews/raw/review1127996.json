With memories all around, leaving is never easy to do, although Jeff seems more accepting of this fate than his blind wife Jennie. However for both of them the morning has more emotional upheaval in store than simply moving house.\n\nWith a couple of interesting actors in the cast, I decided to give this film a try one night despite being rather surprised to see how few viewers it had had (based on IMDb voting etc). I reckon that this must be related to the fact that this short had come and gone by the time it had been added to this online resource because this is a fine film in terms of writing, directing and acting. The story is a simple journey from the home to the nursing home but along the way we get to see and understand a lot of the couple\u0027s feelings about the passage of time and their desire of how they want their lives to go. It is well written so that this is not in our face at any point but is well brought out and convincing. In this way we get to feel for the characters and share a bit of their view of the world they now live in. The direction isn\u0027t showy but it is simple and it uses the locations well  whether it be the confines of the small house or the open road.\n\nThe cast take well to the material  particularly Cobb and Dee, who both are up to the job. They have an easy chemistry and they each produce a convincing person within the script, essentially they make the script work where lesser actors could have seen it being cloying or sentimental. Support from people like Summer and Curtis-Hall is OK but the film truly belongs to the lead two and rightly so.\n\nOverall an interesting and unexpectedly engaging short film that is well written and well acted, producing a short film that deserves to be seen by more people than this database would suggest have seen it recently." }
