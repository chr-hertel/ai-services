Karen Black is her usual hammy self as the psychotic landlady of a rooming house for various misfit characters. They mysteriously disappear at random, while smiling Ms. Black continues collecting on their monthly government checks. She converses with an unearthly male voice from time-to-time...a spirit from beyond the grave, or just a madwoman\u0027s rambling dementia? \n\nNot many great thrills to be had in this, but not bad enough to be harshly criticized, either...EVIL SPIRITS is a take-it-or-leave-it crap shoot- some may find this one entertaining(and gore mongers should find it acceptably gross), but I personally was left underwhelmed and rather put off by it\u0027s occasionally over-the-top comical silliness.\n\nHmmm.... 4.5/10, coulda been worse." }
