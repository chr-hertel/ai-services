After all, the very brief title is not very informative. The special effects are breathtaking, such as huge objects rolling down a slope and the final explosion scene. The pacing is fast, and something is happening every second. The present and the future is mixed together but can still easily be separated. The plot is very clever, it is innovative and well executed. The final twist is a surprise for me, and it makes the film even more entertaining. It really is worth the watch!" }
