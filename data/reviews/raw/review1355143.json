Go now if you can as some of the proceeds for opening weekend will be donated to the memorial fund. This movie brings back all of the emotions that we all felt on that fateful day, it\u0027s gripping and heartfelt. I think it was done as accurately and truthfully as could possibly be done based on the facts that are known about this tragedy, I don\u0027t think it could have been done any better. It\u0027s so hard to put this movie into words, but I\u0027m so glad that I did go see it. If you still think about 9-11, if these people are still in your thoughts and prayers, go see this movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
