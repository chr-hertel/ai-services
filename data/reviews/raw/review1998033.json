I was very happy to see IMDb reporting a \"season 13\". \n\nIMDb says their Season 13 episodes were shown on air in October, 2008. Looking forward to more Frost!. \n\nThis series is one of the best of the British detective series in my humble opinion. Check it out if you like cantankerous old detectives with hearts of gold. I hope it goes on and on.\n\nMy other favorites are Wire in the Blood, Prime Suspect, Hamish MacBeth, The Last Detective, Touching Evil and Da Vinci\u0027s Inquest. That last is technically Canadian but I don\u0027t hold that against it - lol.\n\nSorry I\u0027m not really reviewing this episode, I just wanted to point out the confusing season naming on the US DVD\u0027s.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
