I was of the opinion that apart from Quentin Tarantino no other director can successfully make a good movie based on junk topics. But Michael Bay overcomes the odds. Sure he needed a movie loaded with out of the world special effects, but still it was indeed a good movie nonetheless.\n\nIt didn\u0027t have any big names on the screen. Just numerous robots, good and evil fighting for the world. Surprisingly, however odd this sounds, Michael Bay promoted the story just superbly. Not too much unrealistic, and neither a shade too realism. He had a great visual effects team working with him. Along with teenage beauties Megan Fox \u0026 Rachael Taylor, and Shia LaBeouf. He had Jon Voight on a nominal role plus Anthony Anderson as the funny man.\n\nThe movie features some unbelievable action sequences amongst the Autobots and the Decepticons. The story is indeed junk. But the movie lives on the action sequences and the visual effects, which are literally out of this world.\n\nAn unbelievable 8/10 !!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
