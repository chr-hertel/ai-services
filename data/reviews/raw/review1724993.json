What is with all the people that voted this movie a \"1\"? Iceberg lettuce does not equal positive attitudes. Really though, the plot is a only bit far-flung, (though in regards to many other movies, downright realistic.) The main character even reaches her epiphany in a realistic* way and doesn\u0027t give a motivational monologue to her co - insert-your-physical-flaw-here friends as the climax of the movie - thank god! A marvelous and funny movie, and that is NOT judging it within the \"I\u0027m \"fat\" and proud\" movie genre.\n\nSide Argument: Why is a woman who gains renown through making a movie/TV program about being proud of herself and her body supposed to then go down a few sizes to \"look fabulous\" on the covers of fashion mags? Hypocritical does not even begin to describe.\n\n*Illusions broken; then chaos coalesces into clarity of purpose and true strength.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
