This was the best idea they could\u0027ve had. It was visually delightful. Everything was great and they were so funny. I did not think that Jet Li could pull it off but he just proved that he is not just a martial artist he is also an actor.They worked perfectly together and the movie told a great fantasy story. There were lots of loops and unexpected things and it was fantastic. Jackie Chan will be a legend. No one can do what he has and maintain his humility. Not only is he great at every part of movie making but as a person. I HIGHLY recommend it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
