He gave the English and American cinemas some of the best movies during the first three quarters of the twentieth century. Mr. Haimes takes us to examine the life and the genius of Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nWe are introduced to people that worked with Mr. Hitchcock, like Farley Granger, Tippi Hedren, Teresa Wright, Janet Leigh, among others, and people that admired and were influenced by the man himself such as Robert Altman, Peter Bogdanovich, Robert Bayer, Wes Craven, Curtis Hansen, Brian DePalma, Jonathan Demme and Joseph Stefano, among others.\n\nThe first part of the documentary deals with his early years in London. We are given a good account of how this great man worked during those first years and later on, as he came to Hollywood. Mr. Hitchcock\u0027s collaboration with Alma Reville, his wife, is one of the things that comes across as what made him get involved in projects because it was Ms. Reville who had a critical eye and saw where the best opportunities were for her husband to excel. We also hear from his daughter Pat, who followed her father\u0027s career closely.\n\nTwo of the films that are given more time are \"Vertigo\" and \"Psycho\", both considered by most of the guests that speak in the film as two of the most accomplished movies of Hitchcock\u0027s career. They are examined with great care and analyzed with a great deal of intelligence, especially by Joseph Stefano, the screen writer of \"Psycho\". Credit is also given to Hitchcock\u0027s association with Bernard Herrmann who composed some of the best scores for the master\u0027s films. In fact, collaboration seems to be at the center of everything this great man did, which denotes the intelligence of Hitchcock since he clearly understood that movie making is a collaborative process.\n\nThanks to Mr. Haimes for this most informative account on the life of a true genius: Alfred Hitchcock!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
