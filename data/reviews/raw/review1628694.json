You may ask what did they have to do with the movie? Absolutely nothing......Certain mini scenes/characters were hilarious (in a hung over sort of way) but overall the film just didn\u0027t have the punch. I wasn\u0027t expecting \u0027Friday\u0027 or anything like that but this was more along the lines of \u0027Homeboys From Outer Space\u0027 at best. Marv is sort of funny as a stand up comedian, but it seemed as if he depended too much on that talent in this movie, the acting was horrible, the lighting inside the restaurant was very dim (camcorderesque, I\u0027m surprised I finished the movie...but I quickly unloaded the DVD on someone else.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
