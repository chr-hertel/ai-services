But with this in mind, never has a movie deserved it\u0027s use. \u0027Bladerunner\u0027 for me was and always shall be a riveting watch, from it\u0027s stunning visuals to the utter \u0027vastness\u0027 of it\u0027s Vangelis soundtrack, it remains the perfect example of \u0027sum greater than it\u0027s parts.\u0027 Let\u0027s be honest here, split it into it\u0027s integral parts and you have the potential for a big-fat-turkey. Sci-fi has to work that much harder anyway, but with \u0027Bladerunner\u0027 things such as an over-baring and sometimes obtrusive score, bad acting, continuity inconsistencies, budget difficulties, the terrible narrative, re-writes, on set arguments? somehow Ridley Scott pulled it off. The movie set the standard, sci-fi COULD be Exiting, scary, sexy and even heart warming, using film making skill- not shiny robots, lasers and big baddies in black.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
