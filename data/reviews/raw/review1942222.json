My 5 year old son laughed out loud and wanted to watch it again and again. And found the baseball to be quite funny. Rob Riener should do more cartoon voices. The plot was a good plot for a child to follow and entertaining for adults that need to sit through the movie. It has a nice moral particularly for fiver year olds which seem to be identifying with their limitations. The message to keep trying is a great moral for young children need to hear more of. The movie had great character voices and bad guys that wouldn\u0027t scare many children...my two year old was not frightened at all by the \"bad guys\". I would recommend it for any parent. I wish a few of bad words like stupid were not part of the movie and that I wish my five year old didn\u0027t hear in a G-rated but otherwise quite clean.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
