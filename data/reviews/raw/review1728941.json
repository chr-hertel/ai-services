This is undoubtedly an incredibly well crafted film with an excellent musical score. The special features include an impressive presentation by the Director on the making of the film and his spoken English is evidently flawless. However after thirty minutes or so of watching the film, I stopped it and removed it from my player because of the exasperating inadequacy of the English subtitles. It appears that just about twenty-five percent of the dialog is subtitled and much of the subtitles presented appear to be just summations of what is being spoken rather than word for word translation. For a film of this quality to have such inadequate subtitling is really sad. I realize that reading subtitles and watching a film can be really difficult, but, realizing how much dialog is being missed here is most troubling." }
