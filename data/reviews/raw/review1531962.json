But they weren\u0027t the ones NOT doing the laughing at my screening. Mostly folks like me looking for a reason to laugh, and being forced to do so out of embarrassment.\n\nIf confronting intolerance, be it racial, gender, sexual orientation etc. was the point of the this film, it could have been done more ... effectively (and intelligently). It may not offend you but it will certainly make you feel uncomfortable if there is an empathetic bone in your body.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
