It is very difficult to bring to the screen the sensations of smell, which is the true thing that keeps grenouit, the protagonist, going. it is his obsession. how would one bring such an experience to the screen, to a visual context? the film, a quiet good one, gives lots of shots of grenouit\u0027s nose, an image that tries to make us imagine the smells he experiences. besides, the film really deals with a totally different subject matter: that of morality, human existence and free choice. to all those interested, the film, like the book, is pretty pessimistic about the latter.\n\nWithout spoilers, I really should say that the film is beautifully shot and orchestrated, and is probably director Tykwer\u0027s best work and his most important one. but two main problems overshadow the general success: Ben wishaw and Dustin Hoffman. they were wrongly cast. they do a pretty good job, Wishaw being the better of the two, but they totally do not fit in the shoes of their characters. more on that, the writers chose to ignore or throw parts of the story that could really benefit the finished film, even if they had to add 30 more minutes. on top of all, and despite John hurt\u0027s beautiful narration, we cannot understand grenouit\u0027s real motivations, and director Tykwer does not give us hints to that, both within the story and within his direction of the actor. this is a big miss.\n\nHowever, some scenes are unforgettable and visually beautiful, and also very powerful. Grenouit is a character that bears a lot of pain within himself, and from this pain and passion comes the power to the screen, and also to the film\u0027s sound design. The orgy scene in the last part is wonderfully orchestrated, both in vision and sound.\n\nIf you loved the novel you will probably love this film also. It\u0027s an amazing thing that it was actually produced...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
