He plays the same character he has played for the past 15 years, and frankly, I\u0027ve had enough of it. I won\u0027t tell the whole story here - but his character should have been offed in the first third of the movie. Unfortunately, that character is pivotal - and that\u0027s a big mistake - he\u0027s too slimly to carry this film, he drags it down.In the bit with the IRS accountant, nicely played by executive producer Martin Scorcese, I couldn\u0027t help thinking of the brilliant, and long forgot, comedy \"A New Leaf\" with Walter Matthau. And there are enough chops in the script, and among the other actors, to have produced a film to rival that one.\n\nBut it\u0027s the same old same old Christopher Walken, isn\u0027t it? Pretty good - but could have been better.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
