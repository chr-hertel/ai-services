On the contrary, this movie is so horrible that I was hypnotized. You could not pry my eyes from the TV set.\n\nIn any event, no need to describe the plot because it\u0027s too ridiculous to discuss. Let\u0027s just put it at this: a wanna-be karate kid dork fights gangsters working for a crooked real estate developer. Clich√©s and bad acting abound. Maybe my favorite was the character \"Steve\" who is another karate kid wannabe and has an inexplicable rivalry with the main character. (It would be more believable if Steve was actually cool. But nope, he\u0027s a dork too, so why no love?)\n\nThe \"fight\" scenes are anything but. It\u0027s the same one bad guy at a time procedure...kind of like a movie version of Streets of Rage for the Genesis.\n\nHighlights: - Six-year-olds beating up musclemen gangsters. No really. - Jennifer Lyons and her two best friends (and I\u0027m not talking about the girls the comic sidekick tries to hit on). - The random knife fight in the diner. - The comic sidekick\u0027s lame pick-up lines (so lame, I actually laughed). - The inexplicably evil real estate developer. - The stubborn uncle / convenience store owner who \"ain\u0027t gonna let no one make him sell.\"\n\nWhy did I give it a 5? On one hand, it gets a 1 because sadly the director did not intend for this movie to be a joke. On the other hand, it gets a 10 for all the reasons listed above. So I picked the average.\n\nYou MUST see this movie. Preferably with a group of friends.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
