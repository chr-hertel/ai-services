A great start for a new director and writer. It builds off of a fun evening with a couple trying to save their relationship with a threesome, but turns into the uncomfortable and funny situations that are created after-wards.\n\nThan you add in the group of friends to fan the flames and add a little extra action of their own, and you get this fun film.\n\nI think it\u0027s a great start and can\u0027t wait to see where this new directors career is going to go. I was especially impressed when learning that they were able to create this project with a budget of only around $5,000. It adds to the fact that there is something to be scene from Vince Rocca and Mike Hutchinson in the future.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
