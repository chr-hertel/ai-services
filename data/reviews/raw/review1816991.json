I\u0027m surprised the overall user rating isn\u0027t higher. I love Science Fiction anyway, but it is especially powerful, with a hint of romance. We don\u0027t always need the graphic violence or blatant \u0027love scenes\u0027. Sometimes the subtle approach to any film will energize viewers brain cells and really make us use our imagination. Starman did just that. I really wanted Jeff Bridges to get the Academy Award for his portrayal of an alien who had so many problems trying to adjust to being human. Jeff played his role oh so well, as an adult who was really childlike \u0027in learning his new surroundings. Starman should have received more recognition as a classic in Sci-Fi.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
