They\u0027re stuck in a super market!!!!\n\nI must admit, I am a fan of Stephen King, and am a avid fan of all his books...So why not, Lets watch...\n\nAs a movie, \"The Mist\" turned out to be much better than I anticipated.. Good Acting with Wonderful Camera and Sound for a lower budget film....\n\nDirected by Frank Darabont, whom you can respect (The Shawshank Redemption \u0026 I believe The Green Mile, both also based off Stephen Kings novellas), but a bit weaker than his previous work. \n\nOver all, \"The Mist\" provides its viewers with a whirlwind of emotions throughout the entirety of the film... Suspense, Fear, Anxiousness, Excitement, Disbelief and even Depression..\n\nAny individual who enjoys movies will appreciate this film...\n\nWell made with an ending that will leave ANYONE in aw...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
