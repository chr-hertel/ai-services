Although it wasn\u0027t exactly one of those comedy\u0027s that keeps you excited and laughing the entire time. It had it moments that just were boring and not too funny. The funniest character, in my mind, was Ruby (Wanda Sykes, The Chris Rock Show) and she wasn\u0027t exactly a main character.\n\nJennifer Lopez (The Wedding Planner, Maid In Manhattan) and Jane Fonda (Klute, Coming Home) made a great combination. Jane Fonda came out of a 15 year retirement to do this movie and play the role of the monster-in-law Viloa.\n\nAnother big name, Michael Vartan; known as Michael Vaughn on Alias, played the role as boyfriend and fianc√© of Jennifer Lopez\u0027s character Charlotte \"Charlie\". Charlotte \"Charlie\" best friends were Remy (Adam Scott) and Morgan (Annie Parisse) played a minor role in the movie, but still were pretty entertaining.\n\nOverall I encourage anyone who enjoys a few good laughs in a romance movie to go and see it or rent/buy it when it comes out on VHS and DVD.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
