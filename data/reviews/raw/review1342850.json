As far as I know this is a pretty accurate description of the life and - particularly - the wars of Napoléon. I liked most of the actors and certainly Christian Clavier. However, three things could have been done better. To begin with there are too many battle scenes while it\u0027s impossible to keep overview; instead I would have preferred more attention for the political developments in the Napoleontic era. Then I don\u0027t understand why the movie is in the English language; Napoléon and his friends spoke French! My main objection is that it\u0027s difficult to identify with the main characters. Why does Napoléon do what he does, what\u0027s going on in the minds of Murat or Ney, what exactly attracts Walewska to Napoleon, etcetera? For people interested in what Napoléon might have moved, I strongly recommend the film \u0027Waterloo\u0027 (Bondarchuk 1970) with an overwhelming Napoléon played by Rod Steiger!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
