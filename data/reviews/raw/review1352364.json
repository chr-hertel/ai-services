Back when this movie was filmed, I was an extra in the scene where Gonzo I think that was his name) rides through the cake at the bake sale. The local comic book shop had a sign-up sheet there for it, and the only \"payment\" was free soda.\n\nAnyway.... of all the places to film a Troma movie, the bake sale scene was filmed in the parking lot of a Catholic school in Paramus, NJ. I always thought it was funny they would film even part of a movie like that at a Catholic school.\n\nOverall, though, this wasn\u0027t exactly what I would call a great movie. I probably would have given it a 3 rating. I added 1 for my 2 second appearance on the screen. I\u0027ve seen a few other Troma movies which had more by way of makeup and special effects than this did, but if you truly enjoy campy horror flicks (if you even want to classify this as horror), I guess this could be for you.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
