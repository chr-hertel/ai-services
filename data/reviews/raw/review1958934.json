(1998, Dir. David Zucker) \n\nWhen Det. Nordberg (Simpson) is shot and placed into a coma, bumbling Lt. Frank Drebin (Nielsen) of Police Squad, make it his number one target of who is responsible. It leads him into the presence of rich Vincent Ludwig (Montalban) and a plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II (Charles).\n\nHilarious spoof which doesn\u0027t slow down from start to finish. This was released back when spoof movies actually had a story. Instead of random gags, the jokes are tired together with a well thought of storyline, which shows perfectly why Leslie Nielsen will forever be known as the king of spoof.\n\nFrank, they\u0027re not here for you. \"Weird Al\" Yankovic is on the plane. Â– Captain Ed Hocken (George Kennedy)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
