So, I say it\u0027s not something that would be a good movie to watch so many times. I saw it in the theater, and didn\u0027t enjoy it to much. Only certain parts of the movie are funny. The songs are good, but the plot isn\u0027t very good. I saw it a few times, haven\u0027t watched in four years, so that tells you something. I just think it\u0027s not the best out of the Disney Movies, like Lion King, Toy Story, and other movies. So I give it a 5, it\u0027s alright, but not good. That\u0027s all I have to say about it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
