From the very Jack Black style intro that is just great, to the ending that pretends to go clich√©d and then doesn\u0027t, this is a very good movie. Jack Black suited the role of Po perfectly. The movie is just plain silly at times and then switches to serious, and yet none of the transitions are jarring, they are actually very smooth. The characters in interestingly outlined and you are given quite a few glimpses into the lives and struggles of the others. These glimpses were just enough, any more and there would be information overload, any less and the movie would look half though out. It was very masterfully done.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
