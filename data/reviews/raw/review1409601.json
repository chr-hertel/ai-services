While the former is the most famous, the latter is also something. Portraying ex-tennis player Ray Milland trying to blackmail someone into murdering the man who has been having an affair with his wife, they make the most of everything: Grace Kelly\u0027s beauty, Ray Milland\u0027s tense expressions and camera angle. I read that Hitch filmed it in 3D; seeing how suspenseful the regular version is, I would love to see how intense the 3D version is.\n\nAll in all, this movie grabs like few others do. You just may never trust anyone again after watching this. The 1998 remake \"A Perfect Murder\" was also quite well done.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
