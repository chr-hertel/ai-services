I saw it at the Sedona Film Festival in Arizona. I think it was the best movie there. I felt like the main kid was me. I can\u0027t wait for it to come out in theaters so I can go see it again.\n\nHopefully it\u0027ll come out on video. I never went to Juvy but I had a lot of friend who did. I think this movie should be seen by as many people as possible. It is real to life and people need to know about this stuff.\n\nAnyways, I think it\u0027s one of the best movies I\u0027ve seen so far this year. There aren\u0027t many good movies out and this one rocks.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
