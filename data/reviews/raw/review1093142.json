I do not think you can rank this movie with the kinds of entertainment coming out of Pixar, but Madagascar has a lot to offer. The story was a little weak, but the quality of the animation was very impressive. The scenes of New York and Madgascar were very intricate in their detail and gave the movie a lot of atmosphere. The kids enjoyed the characters which were voiced very well by various celebrities. We particularly enjoyed the scenes with the penguins, who pretty much steal the movie. Lemurs were very cute also. This movie is not \"Finding Nemo\", but our family had a very nice afternoon and it is a high quality movie for kids. Have fun!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
