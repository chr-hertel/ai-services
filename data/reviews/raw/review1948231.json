Don\u0027t believe the text ads on this movie\u0027s own website; advertising people are tuned in to stupidity 27 hours a day and are making lots of money promoting stupidity - believe me, I should know. (They\u0027re only surpassed by the feeble-minded folks advertising NOVELS.) Stupidity sells, so it can\u0027t be that stupid after all.\n\nI ass-u-me most of us would agree with the movie\u0027s take on certain political personae, but this should not stop us from picking our own noses. Is stupidity the only road to peace of mind in the Atomic Infotainment Age? Were our TV-less ancestors better off? Maybe not. If anything makes our times \u0026 age different, it\u0027s that TVs have blown up the individual\u0027s importance out of all proportion - how else is it possible that I feel I should be able to solve every problem on the planet with my informed opinion? Or the mad idea that War can ever be permanently abolished, now that so much is at stake, if all of us only really, really wish it.\n\nLike Monty Python\u0027s \"Life of Brian\", the movie ends with a sing-along song and a note of black humor: \"History is made by stupid people, clever people wouldn\u0027t even try...\" We learn that someone in Vineland/New Jersey carries the distinction of having invented the word \"moron\", and the general history of IQ testing. Other than that, the educational benefit in negligible, but if you don\u0027t expect a solution to life\u0027s questions like you would from a BBC documentary, it\u0027s an enjoyable hour that leaves the brain ticking for a few more. On the other hand, you could benefit from a series of mantras near the end on how to become perfectly stupid:\n\n\"No thoughts are good thoughts...\" \n\n\"Remember not to remember...\" \n\n\"Shift the blame...\"\n\n(for the full course google up the guy\u0027s name afterwards... yes, I\u0027m not kidding)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
