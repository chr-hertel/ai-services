He\u0027s a soldier named Rusty (Wayne) going to San Diego with his pal, Dink (DeFore). She doesn\u0027t tell them her identity, giving her name as Kit Klatch.\n\nKit decides she has to have Rusty star in the film so instead of boarding the train that will take her to L.A., she gets on the train going to San Diego. This leads to all sorts of adventures for the threesome, and it\u0027s obvious that Kit and Rusty, despite very opposing political views, have fallen in love.\n\nColbert is delightful as usual, and DeFore, kind of a Jack Carson type, is always pleasant to watch. The surprise for some will be John Wayne who\u0027s not riding a horse or wearing a cowboy hat. Frankly, this writer has always preferred him that way. I\u0027m not a particular fan of westerns, and the plainclothes Wayne seems handsomer and less stiff somehow.\n\nHere, he\u0027s playing the role of someone whose beliefs are close to his own in real life, i.e., somewhere to the right of Genghis Khan, while the Colbert character is a socialist. Tall and handsome, he does the romantic scenes well; one wishes he\u0027d stayed out of the saddle more often.\n\nThis is a light, fun comedy that takes place in a world that, like Kit, doesn\u0027t quite know which direction to take post-World War II. Seventy-four years later, we still haven\u0027t figured it out, and \"Without Reservations\" remains an entertaining film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
