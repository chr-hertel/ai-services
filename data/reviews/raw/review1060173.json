Filmed entirely in downtown Fargo, North Dakota, this is the best thing to come out of that city since Peggy Lee. Actors Rob Garland, Adam Hagen, Jodi Hedstrom and Sally Jacobson effortlessly capture the essence of the post-college doldrums. I only wish a soundtrack was available, so I could recreate the fun at home.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
