The feature was something \"serious\" like Winchester \u002773. Anyway, as the film progressed, I said more than once: \" This is really a good movie!\" Â– I was 15.\n\nForrester (Cornel Wilde) is the man of mystery. He is a Marine who does a stint with the French Foreign Legion. This was all in the European Theater. He is recruited by, maybe, the OSS to parachute into Nazi territory and check on the devastation wrought by our B 17\u0027s.\n\nWith the help of a phony nun (Phyllis Thaxter) he is able to secure films of a German top secret weapon. These real weapon films are truly fascinating. Even the combat footage of the 17\u0027s is better than average. The whole thing ends with a shoot out on a beach where the main characters are to be picked up by a submarine. We then pan to an executive board type hearing to find out ---- Who is Forrester?\n\nPhyllis Thaxter was beautiful. Cornel Wilde was adequate but quite dashing. Karl Malden, as the Legion\u0027s Maj. Latrec, shows some of the charisma that would blossom into his great talent. \n\nYes. It was a B black and white movie. It WAS a good one!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
