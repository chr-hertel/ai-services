You Got it!", "reviewBody": "What can be said about a title like \"Midnight Meat Train\" that can\u0027t be explained by the said name? Add Clive Barker\u0027s writing, and you have a fun ride through the twisted mind of a horror master...\n\nSolid performances by Bradley Cooper and Vinnie Jones, but the true allure of this gore-fest belongs solely to director Ryuhei Kitamura. Kitamura delivers the brutality in a fast-paced (in your face) style, that hasn\u0027t been seen for some time, with more blood then I have witnessed on film in perhaps forever... The story is dark and suspenseful, with lots of \"Meaty\" death sequences that will surely have you rewinding just to see it again... And again!\n\nAn instant treasure for any fan of Barker\u0027s work, yet equally important viewing for any horror-hound who has a taste for blood.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
