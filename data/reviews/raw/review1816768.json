Not only is the arc of the film done so brilliantly but the whole psychological underpinning especially of the two major characters are turned completely topsy-turvy. Hoffman\u0027s character is especially interesting. The arc his character follows becomes predictable as it approaches the half way mark and his girl\u0027s constant teasing with its undertones of insecurity and doubt makes his transformation by the end into a kind of instrument of extreme violent revenge a self-fulfilling phantasmagorical prophecy.\n\nSPOILER ALERT! By the end, Hoffman realizes just how disdainful he has become with his girlfriend and her twisted mind and sense of values - that at least a part of his revenge fantasy was goaded on by her immoral and vicious behavior - and much more pride and confidence in himself than he ever thought he had. The defense of his home against the men who raped his wife and are now trying to kill him and his erstwhile charge, the retarded man who apparently accidentally and without premeditation, killed a young teenage girl in the village that was trying to seduce the man.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
