I admit that 3/4 of the way through it I almost shut it off. But bad movies get made all the time. This isn\u0027t the unusual thing about this DVD. Upon reading the reviews here at IMDb, I\u0027m convinced that most of the reviewers had to be in the filmmaker\u0027s camp. There is no other way to explain someone actually saying \"this is a great film.\" The story, directing and acting are all mediocre at best. But how they got the lead is really a mystery. Her full frontal sex scene is somehow more embarrassing when you start thinking how they talked her into it. Did she think this was going to be a critical success, a breakthrough role for her? I don\u0027t know. After a little research I discovered that the producer and director are the team that created the wonderful short film \"Whiteface.\" How they made a picture like this is a good question indeed. Now, I did visit the website. This is where things get even more bizarre. They started a petition to try to get the film distributed into theaters. They somehow reasoned (according to the website) that the lead\u0027s previous voice work for the xbox game \"Halo\" would somehow be a box office draw.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
