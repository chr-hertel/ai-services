Released right before the also highly recommended \"Bloof for Dracula\", but this sick puppy is even more deranged...more outrageous...and more amusing! Paul Morrissey\u0027s cult movie is a nearly perfect amalgamation of artsy, typically European exploitation (decorative sets, twisted characters...) and nasty American drive-in cinema (endless amounts of soft core sex and enough gory entrails to pave the roads between Casablanca and Cape Town...). Cult icon Udo Kier is simply superb as the unhinged Baron Frankenstein who wants to create both a male and female monster, so that they can copulate and bring forward a totally new breed of living creatures. Unfortunately (for the Baron, at least) he opts for the wrong male brain donor  the town\u0027s real stud is sharing the bed with his wife, the Baroness  and the monster doesn\u0027t show any interest for his ravishing \u0027bride\u0027. The pitch black humor really works and  believe it or not  the original Frankenstein tale is never ridiculed. I do wish Morrissey would at least had attempted to bring some tension, but what the hell... Just the gore will do in this case, I reckon. Some of the gore highlights include an incredibly nasty decapitation, the optimizing of the female monster and  oh yeah  the unequaled finale which colors the TV-screen blood red! \"Flesh for Frankenstein\" surely isn\u0027t for all tastes (it\u0027s actually one of those \"love-it-or-hate-it\" films) but if you dig 70\u0027s trash/exploitation cinema, this is a must!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
