This movie is Good.", "reviewBody": "Gandhi My Father is a well made movie. It nicely portrays the life of Gandhiji\u0027s Eldest Son Harilal. His character, his differences with his father, his love for his family, his desire to stand on his own, his failure, his ego.. Akshaye Khanna completely justifies the role of Harilal. Just not him, everyone did well in the roles they played. Darshan Jariwala is the best on-screen Gandhiji I\u0027ve ever seen. But I will cut three points as there were few shortcomings.\n\nFirst, movie was fifteen-twenty minutes longer than it should have. Second, the movie needed more research into Harilal\u0027s character. Somewhere, the character looked incomplete. Also, his relation with his brothers was not shown. There was no mention of any other child of Gandhiji in the whole movie. I believe the character like Harilal should be having at least some differences his brothers as well, considering the egoist nature of Harilal.\n\nAnyways, despite some shortcomings, I liked the movie. Recommended...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
