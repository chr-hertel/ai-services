Unfortunately, the jokes all fell flat with either the joke coming from dialog or a sight gag.\n\nI wonder if audiences actually laughed at the theater in 1940 over this stuff. I doubt they would today; it\u0027s just a little too dated, humor-wise, to be rated more than a \"4,\" and that\u0027s being generous. It\u0027s just not funny and certainly not the Tex Avery stuff we animated fans came to love later in the decade.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
