I don\u0027t know what to say other than it was easily the worst movie I have ever seen. I usually like movies, even the fun the factor, no matter if it is good or not, but this was pathetic. Everyone around me was stunned. You could hear a pin drop after, and then a bunch of... \"really\" \"did that just happen\" None of these people should ever work in Hollywood, again the worst movie ever created I don\u0027t have any other words to describe it I am so confused that maybe it was so good that I think it\u0027s bad? I mean thats how bad it was No sane person could watch this and enjoy it Literally, not a sane person in the world", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
