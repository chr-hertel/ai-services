They are the best comedy due to present TV programmes in the past decade. So, they\u0027ve conquered the TV and music industry (the less said about that the better) and they\u0027ve decided to move onto the movie world.\n\nThey should have stayed where they were. They just can\u0027t pull it off as actors. All the way through the film, you are sat thinking \"It\u0027s Ant and Dec, it\u0027s Ant and Dec\" not the characters they are meant to be portraying. The acting is just awful, the two of them seem way to pleased with themselves, they seem to be very big headed and too sure of themselves, thinking that they are almost too good for the movie themselves.\n\nThe plot of the movie isn\u0027t much better, it could have been something really good, perhaps if they cast real actors as the leads. But, still, the plot is boring an uninteresting, filled with weak back-up characters, weak acting, editing and poor direction. I feel as though Ant and Dec only took this opportunity because it was the only movie they were offered.\n\nSorry Ant and Dec, don\u0027t make a movie ever again. I\u0027ve lost respect for you after this.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
