This film is absolutely brilliant! At first, you aren\u0027t sure what the film IS really about...yes, of course, we are told it is a documentary about Indians who work at night answering American 1-800 calls, but beyond that you keep asking yourself \"what is the point? where is this heading?\" - some people I spoke to just didn\u0027t get it at all and felt \"let down\" by the lack of a conventional structure or storylinewhich is EXACTLY what I\u0027m getting to About 30 minutes into the film, after you have spent time with two call centre workers who (understandably) hate their jobs, you get a character who goes by the telephone alias \"Osmond\" - he tells you that, in fact, he quite likes the job and is on his way to becoming a billionaire! Osmond is followed by a mysterious girl called \"Niki Cooper\" who loves the job even more than he does, explaining that the call centre is like her family and that she loves all her callers! This film f**ks with your head Slowly, a picture of transformation emerges. No, there is no straight story line here, but each character builds on the character that precedes ituntil you arrive at the near-cyborg \"Naomi\"  who looks American but is clearly Indian. Her face is bleached white and hair is synthetic blond. Yes, then the \"story\" is clear as day  the Indian has \"become\" a sort of virtual American, physically, mentally and emotionally! Mind you, this is not science fiction or fantasy. It is a \"documentary\" although the film subtly destroys many documentary conventions. It is actually a piece of experimental film-making in the guise of a pop-doc, which is why viewers looking for a film on outsourcing may be disappointed. \"John \u0026 Jane\" uses outsourcing issue as a way to bring viewers in  but the film is clearly about the idea of \"America\" as a utopia for so many people in the world.\n\nIf you are looking for a straight-up BBC film on call centres, STAY AWAY. On the other hand, if you have an open mind and are adventurous about new kinds of film-making, \"John \u0026 Jane\" may be just the thing for you." }
