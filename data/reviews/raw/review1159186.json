The story of a young African-American girl during the time of segregation overcoming all odds with an effervescent spirit and a \"glad\" attitude really connected with me. The characters, music, and dancing are all light-hearted and fun. Although Phylicia Rashad and Keshia Knight Pulliam acted together in the \"Cosby Show\", the relationship in this movie is fresh. I found just about all the characters of the movie to be unique and lovable. I especially enjoy Celeste Holm as \"Miss Snow.\" The relationship that develops between her and Polly, in spite of age and race, makes this story truly remarkable. The character \"Jimmy Bean\", a poor orphan boy, who befriends young Polly, the niece of the richest woman in the county, shows us the power of friendship no matter the obstacles. I also love the metamorphosis of Phylicia Rashad\u0027s character as she adapts to having this bubbly young girl in her life and learns to welcome the advances of her old flame \"Doctor Shannon\", portrayed by Dorian Harewood. I really love this movie and I wish Disney would release it to DVD or video.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
