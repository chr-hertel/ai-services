However, the producers realized that we may get a little lost and have a CIA agent (Rasche) report to his boss (Simmons) everything that we have seen so far. They did this for us twice. Wasn\u0027t that nice of them? Lost no more.\n\nFor George Clooney to play a womanizer with that really bad looking beard didn\u0027t make sense. Here the beard was a distraction, not a turn on as I guess the director expected it to be. Reminded me of Blutto in a Popeye cartoon. \n\nI kept waiting for Frances McDormand to say, \"Ya, you betcha.\" at times (go see Fargo).\n\nThere are some clever lines and antics but I wouldn\u0027t go so far to say they were laugh out loud lines and antics. Well, 7th graders may LOL. \n\nAll is good and enjoyable and there are some twists and turns. And, one really big shocker.\n\nViolence: Yes. Sex: Yes. Nudity: Yes A sex toy chair: Yes, on the pornographic side, so you are warned. A Dildo is involved.
