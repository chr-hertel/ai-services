This was the first Liv Ullmann\u0027s film I\u0027ve seen and the first Bergman\u0027s color film. It is considered to be Ingrid Bergman\u0027s film and she is phenomenal as a talented and world renowned pianist who had never been a good mother to her two daughters. It is much easier to make the whole world happy then your own child. One can be a brilliant artist and read the minds of the other great minds easily but the hearts and souls of one\u0027s own blood and flesh would be the unsolved mystery. I think the film was very personal for both Bergmans in their only work together. It is amazing how bravely they explore the themes and events that could\u0027ve (and did) occurred in their own lives. For me, though, the film belongs to Liv Ullmann, the greatest actress I\u0027ve seen, the best Ingmar Bergman\u0027s actress.\n\nI was riveted to Liv\u0027s face; I\u0027d never seen the face like hers. She played a plain daughter to the brilliant mother and she was supposed to look and feel awkward and gawky comparing to her mother but her face was like a magnet, her eyes - like two deep blue lakes. If ever the saying, the eyes are the soul\u0027s mirror, is true, it is about Liv\u0027s eyes. There are kindness, tenderness, strength, and something even more attractive than beauty itself in them - the goodness of her soul. Dostoyevsky said once that human face has to mean something - I always think of his words when I see performance of my favorite actress ever -Liv Ullmann.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
