A hamster travels to Halifax from overseas to find himself working in a bakery. When delivering bread, he comes upon another hamster who is trapped in a cage and cannot get out. The mission and the passion ensue as one hamster struggles to free the other. I\u0027ve seen a lot of short films that never \"make the grade\" (hell I\u0027ve made some). This little film is exactly the right combination of ambition, polish and execution that most short films should have. Plus a good storyline. Great art direction. It even won an award at the AFF (Atlantic Film Festival)! Wonderfully shot \u0026 directed. Great voice over. Looking forward to the sequel. (To say anything more about a film this long would exceed the duration of the film itself, which would be inappropriate.)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
