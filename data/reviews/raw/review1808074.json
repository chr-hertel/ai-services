You can just feel the hatred of these atheists pouring out in this movie. There are not one but two separate instances of picturing phony and blasphemous preachers in here. That, plus a ton of GDs, mostly said by Angie Dickinson, make this a despicable, extremely bigoted film\".\n\nHuh? (Scratching my head), it\u0027s just a movie...it\u0027s not real life!\n\nThis is a great \u002770s movie about gangsters in the early part of the century. What is not to like. The ever present bad acting of William Shatner. The beauty of Angie Dickinson. Tom Skerritt, Noble Willingham, Royal Dano, Sally Kirkland. What a cast of characters! The music of Jerry Garcia. Produced by Roger Corman. What is not to like? If you have never seen it, I think you will get a kick out of it. \u002770s movie making at it\u0027s best. Period!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
