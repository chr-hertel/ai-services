Of course, we have Gilliam\u0027s usual shifts between \"reality\" and \"imagination\" (sometimes very hard to deal with clearly), between \"comedy\" and tragedy, and between roles (both main characters are Amfortas and Parsifal in turn or at once). And despite its tame \"happy end\" (which I found predictable - ought I say that about a Gilliam movie?!), it\u0027s a sad film. You find happy end only in imagination, so say the fireworks of the final scene. \"Comedy is acting optimistic\", says Robin Williams. Or perhaps this isn\u0027t sad at all, it\u0027s just the real way out? The mind is shaping reality. Man, this movie makes you think, doesn\u0027t it?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
