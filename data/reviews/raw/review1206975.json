It has a different setting, a classic book to work with and plenty of good actors -- including Lee Marvin in his last major role.\n\nHowever it fails on many levels. For a start the plot doesn\u0027t hold much water. William Hurt is very good as a Russian policeman earning next to nothing and living in a country where graft is a way of life. The work revolves around getting your head down and getting on with it.\n\nThe acting is uneven with some actors using their original accents and some cod Russian ones. Talk about not singing from the same hymn sheet!\n\nThe worst part is that the thing is that we are not thrilled -- the plot only points one way and that is towards the main suspect. \n\nPlenty of people praise the book and maybe one day I\u0027ll read it and try and find out why this film was made. But life in Russian (although things have moved on) looks cold, grim and almost unbearable. Even when you have dollars to buy stuff on the black market.\n\nAnother film that has to go down as a failure -- but just about carries you through to the end.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
