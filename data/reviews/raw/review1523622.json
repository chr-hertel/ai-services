This is closest James Bond character I have seen to a real human being.\n\nNot only is Daniel Craigs character the well acted calculating cool killer but also he retains the traditional James Bond arrogance.\n\nOn top of all this the film is actually very good. The finest film of the year if not the best James Bond I have ever seen. Only Sean Connery\u0027s character for me comes close. Incredible opening sequence.\n\nThis has the spirit of Ian Fleming\u0027s Casino Royale in the 21st Century. Craig is cool, funny and physical, Eva Green is stunning(for me the most stunning Bond girl for ages), Le Chiffre is an awesome bad guy. I almost want to be him more that James Bond sometimes in that film.\n\nThis is the best cinema experience I have had for a long time. James Bond is now once again a plausible franchise.\n\nFor the first time in my life a James Bond film has opened up a childhood lust to be a secret agent. I want to be a 00 as cool as Daniel Craigs James Bond.\n\nNow I am going home for a Martini and a game of polka!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
