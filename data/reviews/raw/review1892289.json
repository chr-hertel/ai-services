But again, it takes a different angle.\n\nIf this gets compared to the Saw films, it\u0027s only because they are both gruesome with brutal violence. Both are smart, but this adds a science fiction element to horror.\n\nIf it has a clear strength that the Saw films don\u0027t have, it\u0027s the acting. You don\u0027t feel like you\u0027re watching TV or B-movie actors. Nor does it rely on one central character as much as 28 or Resident Evil do.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
