Gondry did a very good job of weaving the relationships between the characters involved. I originally did not want to see this movie because I didn\u0027t think Jim Carrey was very good in more serious roles, but after watching it I must say that he did an exceptional job. All the characters cast for this movie fit their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood were especially good. I really like these type of comedies, ones with a smarter outlook on comedy. This isn\u0027t a movie that any idiot can pick up and watch. The humor is very witty and takes intelligence to find it funny. I really like movies like that. All in all, I would recommend this movie to any intelligent human being who can understand smart humor.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
