Have a look at the following site, and see what you think (http://www.littlerobots.com/ourworld/index.htm). Is this deliberate or merely intellectual property-rights theft? Is the TV show airing in the USA? If not, for the uninitiated, it is about a Little Robot called Tiny, and his friends Sporty, Noisy, Scary, Spotty and some others (or is this a Spice Girls reunion - can\u0027t be - they were all spotty, weren\u0027t they?) Ho hum - I\u0027ll probably get it in DVD when it comes out over here, but if anyone has seen both \u0027Robots\u0027 it would be nice to know." }
