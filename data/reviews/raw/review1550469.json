One by one, her associates and friends are brutally murdered and she gets to see it all...through the eyes of the killer at the very moment the crimes are committed. And when the mystery psycho suddenly becomes aware of Laura\u0027s gift, the murders begin striking closer to home, as he gets closer to her...\n\nA spec script originally written by HALLOWEEN maestro John Carpenter, it was snapped up by producer Jon Peters as a possible vehicle for then-wife Barbra Streisand. When she deemed it \"too violent\" and demanded certain changes, Carpenter knew when to take the money and run, so he did. David Zelag Goodman (LOGAN\u0027S RUN) is credited with doing the subsequent rewrites which were handled by many others, of course.\n\nIt isn\u0027t a complete mess, and even stands as a pretty vivid time capsule for capturing the look and feel of that period. Dunaway gives one of her signature solid performances, and Tommy Lee Jones is pretty good in this early role for him, as the cop that Laura turns to for protection and much more.\n\nAn also pre-stardom Raul Julia (here featured as \"R.J.\" for some unknown reason) has what amounts to little more than a cameo, and just in case you had any doubts about the setting of this piece, Rene Auberjonois nearly peels the paint off the walls with his totally non-PC turn as Laura\u0027s flamboyant best friend and confidante. It\u0027s to his credit that the movie seems to lose a lot of its life when he\u0027s not on-screen, and his scenes indicate how much fun it could\u0027ve been if it had just taken itself a little less seriously.\n\nEagle-eyed buffs can also spot genre staple Brad Dourif and Darlanne Fluegel (TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A.) as one of Laura\u0027s featured models.\n\nAll in all, EYES is a fitful but entertaining glimpse back into the \"Me\" Decade, whose original ad campaign was much more clever and provocative than the movie itself. It\u0027s also one of the few films from the period that might possibly do well as a remake with the proper writer and director.\n\nAvid thriller readers, take note: author Dean Koontz revisited this plot line in a similar fashion, in his excellent novel, THE VISION. There had been plans to turn it into a feature film, but they may have been scrapped because of the similarities to LAURA.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
