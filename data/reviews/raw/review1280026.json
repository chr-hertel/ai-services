His mother committed suicide..having lived her life filled with hopeless negativity... I believe that change starts within each human being...and the theme of this movie was right on the mark...\n\nHow many people suffer in silence, taking their bitterness out on themselves with self destructive behavior...and sending it outward in a shower of rage toward others?? I was one of them....\n\nThe unconditional love which Helen\u0027s character portrays toward her alcoholic mother..is so key. Key to release..freedom from the pain...of not having her expectations met...Who does? Don\u0027t we always want MORE? Don\u0027t we think we are ENTITLED? It is only in self forgetting that one finds...and of course I did not write that one...you have St. Francis to thank for that.....\n\nCall me a sap...I do not care..for I care to believe that there are those left who will not give in...to the insanity of hopelessness and despair...those people who still believe in love at first sight...and love that has nothing at all to do with materialism...physical beauty...age, creed, or any other shallow attraction....\n\nThis movie changed the way I think...and to me...that merits more than a few tears on a Monday evening.....\n\nIt talks about HOPE\n\nIt speaks of Love\n\nand it captured my Heart and makes me want to Pay it Forward.....", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
