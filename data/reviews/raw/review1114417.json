The show has inspired me to be a 911 dispatcher.\n\nit was nice when people lived it was sad when kids on the show got hurt like the show because i taught me about emergencies the host had good clothing good music to end the show\n\nthe people were good at what they did are there any DVD\u0027s of this show?
