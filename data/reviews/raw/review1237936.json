Sure, the sound and the visuals aren\u0027t ground breaking, but it gets the job done. While this is a darker movie (like many Middle Eastern movies are), there are occasional funny parts stuck in there (epecially with Leila\u0027s uncle). Some of the subtitles are funny too, not on purpose, but they flutter around and sometimes spell a simple word wrong, but that\u0027s not the point. \n\nI own this DVD, and it\u0027s certainly worth renting and watching. It\u0027s a chick flick with out all the sappy stuff.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
