It had a pretty good story line and the actors are fun! I would say watch it... it has potential, there should be a sequel. Laurence Fishburn is a great actor and it is nice that the boy is trying to be like his dad. This is definitely a movie for mature audiences only because you have to be mature enough to understand the plot and follow the story, it is not one of those \"teen\" movies.It is a great movie to watch if you are not afraid of bikes and death, but if you are and if you can\u0027t understand deep stories, this is not the movie for you! If you can handle it, sit back and enjoy this movie, and oh yeah, Kid Rock kicks butt!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
