Sarah Jane Smith has always been my favorite Dr. Who assistant and didn\u0027t want the new producers to trample on my feelings about the character (the way \u0027Star Trek Voyager\u0027 did when they brought back the character of Kes for a one-off episode). I needn\u0027t have been concerned though, it was wonderful. That\u0027s the thing about this new Dr. Who incarnation, it\u0027s so much more emotional than the old version. Perhaps it\u0027s not surprising. The new producers grew up with the show like the rest of us. We\u0027re all older and we want something with a bit more depth than just the same old face-off between the Doctor and the Daleks, the Cybermen etc. (although we want that too). As a result, Elizabeth Sladen got to act in a way that she never did in the old series (and didn\u0027t she look GREAT). I loved that little scene in the caf√© where Sarah Jane talked about how much traveling with the Doctor had meant to her and what it had been like to give it all up. I also loved the final scene where she got to go inside the Tardis again, and the moment when she thanked the Doctor for all her experiences with him. She might have been speaking for all of us." }
