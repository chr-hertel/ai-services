I barely ever label movies that category,(the others are Retro Puppet Master, Dolls, and I\u0027m 12, so don\u0027t laugh: 101 Dalmatians movies). I mean, you have your opinion and that\u0027s okay, but I also have mine, in case you do: Please don\u0027t ridicule my opinion like others do sometimes. I also think it is the best Puppet Master movie, also the puppets could beat Chucky anytime. Okay, I don\u0027t have anything else to say, hey, who else is young and likes 101 Dalmatians: the series? I\u0027ve taped all the episodes off TV. Okay, I don\u0027t have enough lines yet, so, Who also think\u0027s Cadpig\u0027s funny?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
