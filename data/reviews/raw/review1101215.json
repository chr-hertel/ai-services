It was a classic HBO comedy show before HBO had changed the face of comedy with shows such as Dream On and The Ali G Show. Wonderfully created it spoofs \"This Old House\" as well as \"Masterpiece Theatre\" in extremely different settings that you would never expect the original fore-mentioned shows to show up as is just hilarious. I see it as one of the best shows thats not currently on DVD. HBO what are you thinking? If we must suffer looking through aisles and aisles of such DVD sets of Texas Walker Ranger and Pretender and The Shield. I think its about time the world is ready for the comedy styles of this fantastic HBO comedy." }
