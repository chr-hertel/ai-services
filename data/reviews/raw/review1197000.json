However being superficial and slightly chunky himself, the beauties arn\u0027t really dropping at his feet. Until a chance meeting with guru Tony Robbins has him seeing hotties every where he goes, and these beauties actually want him. But there\u0027s one problem, only he can see them as hotties. Everyone else she\u0027s them a uglies, fatties, and trolls. He falls in love with Rosemary, a fatty who he sees as a knockout. Humorous situations arise when she does fat things but we see her as thin. This film wants to have it\u0027s lard and eat it too by inserting a Don Rickles type ending onto the film wherein after spending the majority of the act making fun of people, at the end of the act refuses to diffuse the situation by saying \"..But really we are all brothers under our skin\". But that didn\u0027t make the movie any worse, it\u0027s still hilarious, not as good as \"Something about Mary\", \"Kingpin\", \"Dumb \u0026 Dumber\" or \"Me, Myself \u0026 Irene\", but it\u0027s still vintage Farrely Brothers. Jack Black as always is the shiznit.\n\nMy Grade: B+ \n\nDVD Extras: Cmmentary with directors Bobby Farrelly \u0026 Peter Farrelly; HBO: Making Of; Comedy Central\u0027s Reel Comedy: Shallow Hal; 2 featurettes (Seeing Through The Layers, \u0026 In At The Deep End With Shallow Hal; Dleted scenes with optional commentary; Wall In Your Heart music video by Shelby Lynne; TV spots; Theatrical trailer; and trailers for \"Banger Sisters\", \"Minority Report\" and \"Unfaithful\"\n\nEaster Egg: In the Language selection menu highlight a hidden tail for test footage of that prosthetic", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
