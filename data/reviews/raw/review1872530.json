Although, I really despised this documentary from the first time I was forced to watch it in my high school writing class. I disagreed with everything Moore had to say, and I had to clench my fists through the entire thing. It\u0027s true, he is being the biggest hypocrite imaginable in this film, and he attempts to get some naive viewers attention by triggering emotion in them from all the horrible past events that have happened. I\u0027m a senior in high school and just recently saw this movie for the first time. When I heard that we had to pick a documentary for a required senior thesis paper, I immediately picked this film to write about, and how much I disagree with everything it\u0027s comprised of. But thank you, for doing your research and realizing that his so-called \"facts\" are a bunch of garbage!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
