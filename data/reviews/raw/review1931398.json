I fought it\u0027ll be great! My brother saw it first, and said it was good sh it. Than it was my \u0027turn\u0027. I remember, when I was already going out from cinema, I\u0027ve wished I could Punch (twice) Nolan in his face. Batman is my fave comic hero...but it\u0027s not important right now. What\u0027s important is that God Damn Nolan gave us piece of Max Commercial movie for little kids. It\u0027s not realistic, as Nolan said it would be. And it\u0027s not \u0027dark\u0027 either. I should\u0027ve known that The Dark Knight will be the same sh it as Bat: Begins...But it doesn\u0027t help for my frustration. \n\nI wish Burton could make few more Bat Movies...His dark vision of Gotham was incredible. Art Deco with style and fashion of 50s, combine with present time...o.k. with late 80s...And Jack as THE JOKER...I think it was a role of his life...H. Ledger was good, but he didn\u0027t beat Jack The King... but he was really good....Shame, that Ledger was the only one who knew what he was doing...And in the end...Joker didn\u0027t save the day...and The Dark Guano is one of the worst movies I\u0027ve ever seen. 1 of 10 is more than it deserves. I\u0027m not from The Great US of A...or England. So if my comment seems a little shi tty, give me a brake... Post Scriptum Bale was totally without balls in this movie. I like him butbut I\u0027m telling what I\u0027ve seen. But what totally destroyed the movie, were giant holes in plot and this incredible stupid device, that converts mobile phone in Allah, God, Buddha, Confucius knows what. PS2 I must tell thisdo any of you believes that prisoners on one of those boats loaded with explosives, wouldn\u0027t have blown to high sky that other boat? And the same about those good citizens", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
