So many others have already commented on SVD very accurately. SVD lacks focus and continuity, editing is seizure inducing and the audio will have you looking for the Tylenol 3 bottle in about 10 minutes.\n\nIf you watched the movie, you might be a gore fan, puke fan, titty fan, a grungy hooker with bulimia fan...anyway, the point is, we like this sort of thing. We look for over-the-top subjects. We look to be shocked. That really doesn\u0027t happen with this ditty.\n\nI think, and as others here have said, it would work much better at about 20 minutes in length. The show takes too long to end. Backward audio and pot-banging sounds just assault your skull. Really, this movie is just awful...and I like gore and the odd and the over-the-top, but this just blows." }
