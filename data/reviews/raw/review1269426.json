It does has a lot of technical things inside the plot which may make your brain hurt but it\u0027s a film well worth taking the time to see.\n\nSix (well seven really) people wake up inside a fourteen foot by fourteen foot cube shaped room with no idea of how they got there or why they are there. Travelling through the rooms they encounter much more than they bargain for with \u0027traps\u0027 laying in wait for them.\n\nThey must figure out a way to escape the cube before they die. The real question is, is the danger the cube or the people themselves?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
