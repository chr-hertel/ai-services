I\u0027m 29 years as I write this and I was 12 years old when this came out. I was enjoying 6th grade summer down at the good old Jersey shore. The movie exemplified the late 80\u0027s \"feel good\" personality. As for the movie, the chemistry between Andrew McCarthy And Jonathan Silverman was just amazing and magical to say the least. Andrew McCarthy reminded me of myself and Jonathan Silverman reminded me of my best friend. The movie just makes me feel good every time I watch it and yes I own the DVD. Rock On Bernie and let\u0027s hear it for the 1980\u0027s and especially 1989 baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
