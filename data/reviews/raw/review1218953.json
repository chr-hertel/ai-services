It built off of number 3 by integrating the previous architecture and design. In this Harry Potter, the landscape plays less of a role and the director turns the viewer\u0027s attention back to the magic and fantasy of the wizarding world. The music was also well done and didn\u0027t detract from any aspects of the movie.\n\nThe director is playing on the fact that most viewers will have read the book. There are some elements that have not been explained as in-depth as in the books, but that is to be expected-- there is a lot to cover. He did a really good job of the climactic scenes and in juxtaposing a lot of different elements.\n\nThe only problem that I could see with this Harry Potter was the depiction of Dumbledore. The actor interpreted Dumbledore as a more aggressive and high-strung character than in the books and previous movies. I don\u0027t feel that this interpretation does justice to the core character and this interpretation needs to change for the following movies.\n\nAll in all, I loved it!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
