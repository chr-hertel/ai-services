My wife and I enjoyed this movie, and thought it well done. Although there was no nudity or foul language, there were some pretty intense scenes that would likely disturb a child. (I don\u0027t want to give anything away, so I will be minimal on the details.) The scene after they reach \"skull island\" is very intense and may disturb a child. The \"canyon\" scene was very gruesome and even made me squirm. Especially the \"..slow absorption\" shall we say.\n\nKing Kong IS a very good movie. We enjoyed it very much, BUT we are so glad we did not bring the children. We did overhear on the way out of the theater, some parents who DID bring their children and were kinda upset. They said the same thing that it should have been rated \"R\"", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
