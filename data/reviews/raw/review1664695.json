Only they come into as much trouble facing local war criminals, as much as they do when they face the beast itself.\n\nIt was never going to be in the running for Oscars or Cannes prizes but come on people take it for what it is, a fun slightly political creature feature about a giant African crocodile.\n\nPersonally they could of left the political side of the story out for me same can be said for the recent Korean creature feature The Host also.\n\nBut there\u0027s enough action set pieces in this to make it worth an hour and half of anybody\u0027s time. Nice to see Prison Breaks Dominic \u0027Linc\u0027 Purcell in a feature too.\n\nOn a final note the crocodile FX are handled really well considering its mostly cgi. So undeserving of its bottom 100 slot I gave it a better than average 6/10.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
