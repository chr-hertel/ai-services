It is an excellent movie. It portrays a spiritual battle between good (God) and evil (the devil). think about it - reports of UFO\u0027s and their sightings especially UFO landing report smelling sulfur. And in the Bible sulfur represents evil/darkness. The Bible does not promote paranormal activities, magic nor witchcraft - just the opposite, the bible condemns it. The Bible even condemns astrology. Unidentified is a movie for those who really want to start thinking about the \"what ifs\". So, for these who did not \"like\" the movie, get a good Bible commentary, and good Study Bible and read up and I encourage you to think about what the Bible says about how the Devil can use supernatural things to turn people against what is right. this is what the movie Unidentified is all about. To start thinking about what the Devil uses to keep people away from becoming Christians and that means using the idea of life on other planets, spaceships, paranormal and the like.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
