Jacques Clouseau\u0027s (Peter Sellers) gaffes. This time, former Commissioner Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) escapes from a mental institution - you may recall that he went crazy in the previous installment - and kidnaps a scientist to build a doomsday device. His demand: the world must kill Clouseau or perish.\n\nOf course, this is all an excuse to have Clouseau make a mess everywhere that he goes. Whether it\u0027s his apartment, the piano, or anything else, you can always count on this guy to cause a series of mishaps. And of course, there\u0027s always Cato (Burt Kwouk) waiting to attack. And that final sequence was great (hint: think of a certain shark-related movie). All in all, a comedy classic. It\u0027s a shame to have to learn that Peter Sellers was such a jerk in real life.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
