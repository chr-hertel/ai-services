(Obviously because it\u0027s a Christmas movie.)It stars Kris Kringle. He believes he is Santa Claus, and everybody else believes that he is crazy. So, a lawyer (I forgot his name.) tries to prove that he is the real Santa.\n\nMiracle on 34th Street talks about the existence of Santa, but never seems corny, like we expect most Christmas films to be. No, instead it\u0027s sweet and somewhat charming.\n\nThe ending is pretty interesting too. Although I liked the ending of the re-make better, I still enjoyed this one. (I\u0027m talking about the ending of the court battle.) The characters seem to have depth and the film seems to have a certain charm and warmth in it.\n\n8/10 \n\nFeel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
