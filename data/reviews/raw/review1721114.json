Week after week the episodes were fairly uninspired and too \"kiddy\" for the most part. I don\u0027t mean that there aren\u0027t \"adult\" situations (most via violence), but I say \"kiddy\" in the sense of abandoning the logic of internal consistency, and THE WAY PEOPLE BEHAVE. The previous two-parter where The Doctor becomes human was quite good for the most part (but still had the wooden behaviour apparent especially in the villains).\n\nNow comes Blink. Holy mackerel! I wonder why this episode is so radically better than most of the others. Is it a fluke? Or is the team that made this simply unavailable for most of the other episodes?\n\nIt\u0027s the only one I just had to watch from the beginning immediately after (not because I didn\u0027t get it, but because it was so damn good).", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
