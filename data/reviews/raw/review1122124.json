Unfortionatley, they got lost in the inter-dimension, and were consigned to wandering between the many parallel universes in the hope of someday finding their way home.\n\nWhen Tracy Torme\u0027 and Robert K. Weiss created this show in 1995, they had truly made something special. Unfortionately FOX decided to completely ruin it.\n\nThey began by airing the episodes out of sequence in the first 2 seasons, meaning that there could be no continuity between episodes, so whenever an extra character slid with the Sliders they were never seen again (with one poor exception). In the 3rd season David \"Peckerhead\" Peckinpah (a man with less talent than a dog turd) became an Executive Producer and many episodes became movie rip-offs instead of \u0027what if\u0027 concepts where parallel worlds had alternate histories to our own. The amazing John Rhys-Davies was then fired mid season 3 and replaced with Kari Wuhrer, a terrible actress who played a terrible character.\n\nFOX allowed the Sci-Fi channel to take over the show for its 4th and 5th seasons. They put David Peckinpah completely in charge of the show, and he buried it by having ape-men called Kromaggs take over the Sliders\u0027 home world and by rewriting the backstory of the lead character completely. The premise was changed from finding home to fighting ape-men. In the last season, only one of the original Sliders remained.\n\nWhen the show finished, it was without any resolution to many of its story arcs or the final episode\u0027s cliffhanger.\n\nI feel Tracy Torme\u0027s pain. No one could have imagined that they would create a show as brilliant as Sliders, only to see it totally destroyed before their eyes.\n\nSliders had so much potential, but it was ruined by talentless hacks like \u0027Peckerhead\u0027.\n\nThe first two seasons and the first part of season 3 are really all that are worth watching unfortunately.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
