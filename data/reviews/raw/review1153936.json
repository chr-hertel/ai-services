He paints a bunch of professionals who are minding their own business, trying to get their jobs done the best they can, as a bunch of morons. The unintended result is the depiction of Wilcha\u0027s insecurities, jealousy, and general sour grapes. What he doesn\u0027t understand is that not everyone in the corporate world is a sell-out, and not everyone who can\u0027t make a living is a noble artist. Is it really possible that besides Wilcha\u0027s boss Rick Hunt (the only good guy in the whole movie), no one at the company has both a brain AND a heart? Columbia House allowed Wilcha to aim his camera at the company every day, so it seems to me that they had nothing to hide. Wilcha obviously does, but wasn\u0027t successful.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
