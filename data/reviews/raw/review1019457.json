Not that I was deeply touched by the acting or by the plot, but the editing is where everything is tumbling. Resnais literally put up in images some obscure and thick literary movements like James Joyce\u0027s own \"stream of consciousness\".\n\nIt\u0027s for hardcore cinema addicts, it\u0027s interestingly build, and it\u0027s totally new(for the era). Resnais strikes me as one of the best(or THE best) director coming out of the french new wave. \"Hiroshima Mon amour\" it before it\u0027s time and should be praised for it\u0027s audacity. Alain Resnais is a big step forward for modernity. He\u0027s often overshadowed by attention addicts like Godard, but he definitively is(in my opinion) the most impressive director of all the new wave.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
