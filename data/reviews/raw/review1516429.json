His liberating approach to African history and its impact on the world stage has freed me to utilize his innovative approach in something as seemingly mundane as Sunday School. The inclusion of African history in my Sunday School teachings (thanks to Dr. Clarke) has contributed to an explosion of attendance and constructive input. I will continue to watch this magnificent piece of cinematic work whenever I can find it. Dr. Clarke\u0027s spirit literally breathes life into Bible teaching every Sunday in my neck of the woods.Thank God for blessing us with his liberating mind!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
