The movie is FUN...it\u0027s STUPID COMEDY...just because every movie isn\u0027t Ben Hur or The Godfather doesn\u0027t make it total junk. If someone is going to read the reviews of this movie, then odds are they know what this movie is about. And they don\u0027t need to hear what a bunch of square eggs say about it, either. It would be tantamount to asking a bunch of 18-year-olds writing a review on the silent film \"The Birth of a Nation\". In my opinion, any review giving a movie less than 5 stars must\u0027ve been written by someone not appreciating what the movie is all about (and should be discarded). In other words, people who shouldn\u0027t have watched the movie in the first place. Maybe every movie theater should ALWAYS have Driving Miss Daisy available to these people just in case they may be \"forced\" to watch something different. That being said, I loved Date Movie, Superhero Movie, and a whole list of other stupid comedy movies and I don\u0027t think this movie was that bad...though not that great, either. If you liked Meet the Spartans, you\u0027ll like this one. It is pretty fast-paced and there are some funny parts you\u0027ll remember. I really would give this movie a 6 or 7, but I\u0027m upping it to an 8 because I don\u0027t think a 1.3 rating is fair AT ALL.\n\nHope this helps someone.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
