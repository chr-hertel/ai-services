Not annoying bad because I watched it till the end.Just bad.\n\nThe main idea is curious - enough for a short story - but nothing more. On top of that, the plot lacks consistency - how is it that you get so many zero-lovers (?) in the same district of some far-away American village. But perhaps it is not supposed to be consistent. \n\nThe acting is OK, although it is very amateurish at times. It is a bit weird how Hollywood or its offspring produces the clones of famous actors. Is it to make a low budget movie more attractive?\n\nAnd it\u0027s not funny. Didn\u0027t quite understand why it gets the credit for being a comedy here and even a good one! So if you are out to get a comedy that actually makes you laugh, go look for something else.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
