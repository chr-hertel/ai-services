Plain old. Watch American hardcore if you really want to see what the punk is. For Christs sakes. Good Charlotte? Green day? BILLY IDOL!?! MY CHEMICLE ROMANCE?! Pennywise? The Casualties? Rancid? Sum 41? These aren\u0027t punk. I\u0027m sorry when a punk documentary includes these bands you know its complete bullshit. For example. Most punks won\u0027t even consider Sex Pistols or The Ramones to BE punk. Sid vicious was a nihilistic junkie, and Johnny was a conservative Raegan Supporter. Now not to say this movie doesn\u0027t have some good points.\n\nBut if you really want to see what punk is and not some people trying to follow a formula go out to local $5 shows, and stuff like that! Listen to bands like The Exploited, TSOL, Minor Threat, Circle Jerks, D.O.A., Black Flag, The Stooges, MC5, Dead Kennedys, FEAR, Subhumans, Social Distortion, 45 Grave, Bad Brains (early stuff), Gang Green, Johnny Hobo and The Freight Trains, Battalion Of Saints, Choking Victim, Citizen Fish, Crass, Gang Of Four (Sex Pistols with meaning), Iggy Pop, INDK, Jerrys Kids, Leftover Crack, Lou Reed, MDC, Negative Approach, Nig-Heist, Nina Hagen, Operation Ivy, Pere Ubu, Siouxsie \u0026 The Banshees, Sonic Youth, Sublime, The Addicts, The Clash, The Stranglers, Koffin Kats, Tiger Army, The Vandals, The Velvet Underground, Transplants, Scream. There\u0027s TONS! And remember. Punk doesn\u0027t need to be hardcore punk. Lou Reed, Pere Ubu, The Doors, and The Velvet Underground are perfect examples.\n\nSee American Hardcore for a good punk Documentary. You will NOT be disappointed", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
