Carrier operations are shown in much detail making those familiar with them realize that little has changed in running those floating military airports. The catapult launching, the recovery using tailhooks and nets, use of the \"tilly,\" a kind of gantry on wheels to move disabled planes --- all these remain essentially the same. The flagman signaling to the incoming pilot as to his position in relation to the deck, however, is today a rare sight. With the development of avionics, the pilot nowadays is electronically hooked on to the carrier\u0027s sensors telling him how the deck is inclined (it\u0027s a ship pitching on the waves, remember) so he could approach it at the correct angle for a safe landing.\n\nAlthough made with the US navy\u0027s and presumably the Department of Defense\u0027s cooperation, the film does try to balance between the jingoistic rant of \"cold warriors\" prevalent at that time and the peace lovers. The intervention in Korea is justified by the Admiral (portrayed by Frederic March) so that they wouldn\u0027t have to fight the enemy on American soil. Commander Brubaker (William Holden), however, feels that he is \"in the wrong war, in the wrong place.\" \n\nThe bombing run scenes are magnificent in their scope and the superb flying of the pilots in the smart looking Panthers are memorable.\n\nCompare with The Hunters, another film about the Korean war starring Robert Mitchum and Bob Wagner as Air Force pilots.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
