In this particular episode, I feel it could have had more bite if it was shorter, and the script needed some action sequences, I was bored at the hospital. You are much better off with the original Twilight Zone (obviously), Tales From the Crypt, or The Outer Limits (either the old one or the new). Jason Alexander gives a perfunctory but competent performance as death, but fails to shock or surprise us with anything. I think we are generally too jaded when it comes to entertainment, but for the record, I don\u0027t think anyone in 1959 would have found this groundbreaking either.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
