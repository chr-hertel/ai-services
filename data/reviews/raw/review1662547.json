Jack is back and he is only getting more annoying, many pirates you loved now you hate and vis-Varese. The movie is so long people fell asleep, mainly kids and oldies. Also to note, POTC:3 has so many twist turns and death in it you really just don\u0027t give a it who dies and makes the film somewhat more confusing with its unhighly detailed subplots and references to the past that we never saw. Acting in this film is getting old, Depp has a great character and after this film you just get tired of him. The ending is an ending. The beginning is a middle or a half made future from which the film never points out how long. Fights and special effects are done nicely and the film\u0027s score is\u0027nt that bad but its nothing new. There is some nice comic-relief in the film that is\u0027nt the smartest but will get you chuckling. POTC:3 is a film that gets tired fast, has a almost never ending plot twists, mediocre acting, some nice visuals that altogether make a film that is passable at the lowest level.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
