The plot is some kind silly, involving some high-school students with nothing better to do than just inventing some serial killer story and freak out other people around the campus and outside of it. The acting is good, but the lines are sometimes silly, really hard to understand, leaving a lot of questions, which is good sometimes, but not in this case because they don\u0027t make a lot of sense. Ridiculous portions, where they play a silly game, show up and mess up the story a little bit.\n\nMy advice is if you haven\u0027t seen it, don\u0027t buy it... If you can, just get it from a friend who already did this mistake...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
