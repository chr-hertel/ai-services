(He still cracks the occasional joke and has his quirks). The story is nothing new, essentially, ex triad member (Played by Max Mok) goes straight so he can be happy with a newfound love, but gangs are hard to get out of... This film also reeks of the late 80\u0027s with it\u0027s colossal cell phones and small boxy cars, as well as the music and clothes, but in my opinion it just adds to the experience.\n\nOverall the actors did their jobs well and the underrated Max Mok is cool as the main character. Although this movie isn\u0027t a masterpiece it is an entertaining watch and it is interesting to see a young Stephen Chow in one of his first major roles.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
