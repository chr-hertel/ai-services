It was so good to see Demi Moore back to the big screen , and in such a fantastic role,, there were so many twists and turns in this movie, felt like you were on Lombard St., Anyway Dane Cook practically stole the show,, i never thought for a N.Y. Minute that he could be serious , but to my utter amazement he was great in his role, But for me it was Kevin Costner who was just brilliant and stole the whole movie,, i like the fact that the movie isn\u0027t geared to all of those special effects, i mean yeah there are some in there, but it\u0027s not so over the top. the plot line is pretty interesting in the fact that this \"serial killer\" is the \"man of the year\" and really does not want to kill anymore,, fact is he goes to one of those 12 step programs,, pretty neat i thought,, all in all i just loved this movie , and would recommend this one to anybody..", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
