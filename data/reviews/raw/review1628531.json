If we set a side historical mistakes,movie is nothing more then some B production action movie on steroids,which was meant to show how good guys come from the west and bad from the east.So typically for Hollywood war movies,and very alarming if we consider current American politics towards eastern countries(Iraq,Iran,Lebanon-former Persia).Is this movie a war propaganda for next U.S. intervention?Probably not,but it is suitable for average American view of freedom,love,politics and history. Acting is poor,scene is artificial and maybe the only good thing in the movie,directing average.Scene of combat catastrophic,with accent o blood thirsting soldiers,so false and ridiculous. At the and the only word that comes to my mind,to describe this film, is awful.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
