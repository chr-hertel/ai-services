The music is great, but at the same time you won\u0027t hear anything great that wasn\u0027t given away in ads and trailers. I think with musicals, giving away the best music outside the film, is kind of like giving away the plot. Basically, the only significant singing you didn\u0027t already hear (before going) is them singing pure two-way dialog. Of course a musical should be filled with music, but please don\u0027t think you can take any two-way conversation, and turn it into a duet. The \"Sound of Music\" is an example of how a musical *should* work in singing and dancing. Only emotional and significant character dialog should be put to music (in addition to \"true\" songs).\n\nAs we know from the small size of the mask, the phantom is hardly seriously disfigured (I\u0027m not revealing anything here that\u0027s not given away in the movie billboards). He wears it like Batman\u0027s mask; a kind-of fashion statement. The key characters are hardly developed. I won\u0027t give away the Phantom\u0027s back story. But, I will tell you it\u0027s pretty lame. Remember this film is not the same as the 1943 film, which was not a musical, and did have a clear motivation for the Phantom.\n\nOne thing that really let me down, was how small the opera was. I was expecting a huge opera building, with lots of space, lots of crevasses. After all, a guy is hiding out here for many years, without detection. Turns out it\u0027s a pretty small place. OK, maybe it is as big as the \"real\" thing. But, I don\u0027t want reality. I want fantasy. I want bigger than life. By nature, the \"Phantom\u0027s Opera House\" aught to be truly grand. It should be the kind of place where you\u0027ld be afraid to be in at night. The kind of place you could get lost in.\n\nNow, I know my review sounds like I\u0027m dumping on the movie. But, keep in mind I can\u0027t convey the great music, and good look, which you know about, before going to the movie. If what you\u0027ve seen and heard is worth seeing for 2hours, then go see it. But please, do not see this video-cassette on a little TV. Catch it only in a theater, or on an entertainment system with great sound/video quality. That\u0027s all the film has.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
