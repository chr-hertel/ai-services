However if you are looking for to see Arnold act in what was probably one of his most difficult roles this movie is not to be missed. Most people don\u0027t get that this movie was a parody. It must have been incredibly tough for an actor used to working in a world where cars explode if you scratch them and characters are thinner than a piece of newspaper to move into a world of real cars and real characters. What worked for me in this film is that Jack Slater became a surrogate father to Danny Madigan. People looking for bigger and better explosions should move on and see True Lies. To view Last Action Hero start by thinking in terms of Kindergarten Cop, Twins, or Junior.\n\n-- Chris", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
