Bleeding hearts today are naive to think that evil isn\u0027t real. Hitler really did exist, and several other Hitler\u0027s exist to this day, all over the world and many in our own country.\n\nThose who don\u0027t think so should watch this movie (\"Hotel Rwanda.\")History has already repeated itself and will do so again unless we do something. This movie should be required viewing in schools. It\u0027s appalling to me that nobody did ANYTHING to stop this. One battalion of marines could have ended all that. President Clinton did nothing. He could have sent the marines in but didn\u0027t feel that would help him in the polls for whatever reason. He DID NOTHING. The United States Congress DID NOTHING. The blood of these 1 million people is partially on their hands.\n\nAll it takes for evil to triumph is that good men do nothing. Evil triumphed in Rwanda.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
