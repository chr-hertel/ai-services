The best Tom and Jerry cartoons had them using objects around them to inflict greater and more surreal pain on one another... here the cartoon focuses on the objects themselves, such as a toy train, at the expense of some cat on mouse ultraviolence. Even when we do see the physical assaults the two lay on each other, it\u0027s tempered with a more realistic coding... Tom\u0027s extended tail lasting for several frames, for example, rather than being immediately shook off.\n\nMost of it is just inexplicably mediocre, a substandard calibre of which you can\u0027t quite put your finger on. But a lot of it is to do with charm, and whereas the original series could sometimes get too self-consciously cute, this one tries to be post-modern, with Tom\u0027s gazes to the viewer a distraction.\n\nUltimately, there\u0027s no pace, flow or even soul to this one. It\u0027s just a series of uninvolving set-pieces, with an inexplicable ending that neither resolves the story adequately or amuses. Stick to stuff like Cue Ball Cat (1950)... you\u0027ll be glad you did.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
