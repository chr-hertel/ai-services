I am STUNNED - the previews just do not do this film justice! I defy anyone who opposes the magical,innovative and sensational script, the magnificent acting - it is very evident how much work Whitherspoon and Ruffalo put into this. It is a never-before-told fairy tale. It is absolutely STUNNING, there is no other word for it. This is a must-own movie that will make you laugh, keep you on tenterhooks, and make you laugh again. Both man and woman can rejoice in the different takes on life both genders have. It was so entertaining, I wished it just wouldn\u0027t end - Whitherspoon and Ruffalo make SUCH an adorable couple! This is just one of those movies you watch over and over and over again. It is so much fun, and everything you could ask for in times when it seems all Hollywood can offer us is insipid horror tales and cheap remakes of classics. Ah, Just Like Heaven IS heaven! Bravo, bravo, BRAVO!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
