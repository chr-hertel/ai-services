Then for many many years I hadn\u0027t watch it, due to the fact they stopped airing it. It is only till recently I have started watching it again thanks to cable. Wow the memories came flooding back like B.A. punching a SUCKER. The joys, the fun, the laughter and the action. I \u0027m now officially addicted to the A-team, I watch it every evening, with anticipation. The madness of Murdock (my fav), the strength of B.A. Baracus, Faceman the smoother and the man, Hannibal. The characters were unique, original and you learned their names in the first episode. Automobiles, guns, explosions, fistfights, comedy, great acting and all that was in the first 5 minutes. It\u0027s a whole family show, even the granny likes it. The tune is one of the best T.V. theme tunes of all time: lets have a sing-da da da daaaa da da daaaa, da da daaaa du du du du They made things from scratch to defeat the enemy, and there was a lot of imagination to come up with this from the producers. It was awesome. It wasn\u0027t silly or fake, it was fun and exiting. They drove that van in style, and there was some great helicopter moves. No one ever died and that was great, very friendly, I just love it, its new and fresh.\n\nThe message I\u0027m trying to get at is all this above is the reason it was so good. Yes people got out of cars after they was driven off a cliff, but that was one of the best bits about it, don\u0027t change this, when it comes round to the 2006 film. The film: This film for me isn\u0027t going to work; the majority of Hollywood remakes are awful and pathetic. They are not even using the original cast, Dwight Schultz AKA Capt. H.M. \"Howling Mad\" Murdock is an absolutely fantastic actor, he stole the show sometimes, and when I get round to making films, I \u0027m calling that guys agent. Apparently the film isn\u0027t going to be like that described at the top of this article. Its going to be violent and whole new cast, well shame on you lot who\u0027s helping to make the film, because it is going to SUCK, FOOLS. Bruce p.s. if you know any one who has Murdock\u0027s leather jacket or one like it, give me a shout." }
