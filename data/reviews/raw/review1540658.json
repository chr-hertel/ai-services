It had everything a disaster film needed, action, ambivalent characters, and intense film-making. To admit truthfully, I had no high hopes for this remake of Poseidon.\n\nTo put in simple terms, it was not that great. It wasn\u0027t a bomb, but it wasn\u0027t spectacular. it had a substantial amount of action with some spectacular special effects that looked realistic fro the tidal wave to the destruction of the ship. But the film lacked a story. It had a story, but it didn\u0027t have any real energy to carry it out, except for the action/visual effects.\n\nThe story doesn\u0027t work well either, because the characters aren\u0027t developed, and the actors were not well chosen. Kurt Russel and Josh Lucas may have been heroes, but they were no Gene Hackman. Richard Dreyfus, a talented actor from past films didn\u0027t fit in for his role. He hardly spoke in the whole full! Since it was an action flick, the time flew by. It was a good 90 minute diversion fro mdaily activities but nothing more. \n\n** out of **** Want a good disaster film, see the original Poseidon.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
