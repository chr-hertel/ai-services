When one of the employees from there shows Morella an important paper he took he gives him $10,000 without batting an eyelash.He then sends some of his efficient men to city hall to ransack the place so as to cover for the missing paper.In the next minute he informs his secretary to make a note of $10,000 spent for publicity.He does this so casually the viewer may not even be aware of his claiming an expense for the $10,000 pay-off.To my recollection this was my first time seeing the actor Roger Pryor, he has the part of Max Gates.For Morella he\u0027s a staff member/enforcer and a sharp cookie himself.Pryor\u0027s performance may of been the best in the movie.With a smooth voice and sometimes cocky manner it was entertaining to hear him refer to the customers as suckers and fish.He was equally talented to show fear when found in a tight spot,impressive.While watching this movie I found entertainment sources coming at me from different directions.The same Jane Wyman that was a proper lady hosting her own TV show and played innocent Johnny Belinda is a young blonde in this movie.Despite her goody-goody name-Laurie Ogden she plays Morella\u0027s secretary.She\u0027s not tough acting but does do her share of 1940\u0027s snappy talk.That along with the blonde hair is enough to keep the viewers attention, as in..\"that\u0027s Jane Wyman?\"Then there\u0027s Frank Ferguson doing a good part as the d.a. Not a houshold name he has many credits,I\u0027ll always remember him as the owner of the chamber of horrors in Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein\u0027s.He was very worried how a\u0026c handled the crates that contained Frankenstein\u0027s and Dracula.The acting in this movie merits more compliments but I have to stop,entertaining,give it a chance.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
