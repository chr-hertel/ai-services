Granted, this movie\u0027s more of a compliment to the video game of the same name, but it extends the back story of the game and gives a different look at the scenarios. This movie\u0027d probably be more liked by fans of the game than to most other people, but it can be all but assured to be a fun, entertaining flick for just about anybody.\n\nParents, if it wasn\u0027t obvious by the trailer, this is not a kids movie, but I feel it\u0027d be fine to let older kids watch this film. Great effects good writing without a lot of gratuity and nice cast earn this movie at least a 7 for me.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
