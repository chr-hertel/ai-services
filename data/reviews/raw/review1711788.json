I really don\u0027t understand how anyone could NOT have loved it...its funny,the casting was great,the story lines are funny and original. All of the cast did so well and u have to be blind and with NO idea what they are talking about,because they have one of the funniest casting that i have seen in a long time. They all work so well together and it really showed and I\u0027m SOOO mad and sad that it went off the air. It was a good show and definitely deserves reruns!! The thing that i don\u0027t understand is how it could have been canceled. It was such a good show and i wish that people would have given it more time to grow and become even better. \"Complete Savages\" is one of the best shows i have ever seen and anyone who doesn\u0027t think so needs to watch it one youtube again because it really is a great show and it deserved more attention then it got." }
