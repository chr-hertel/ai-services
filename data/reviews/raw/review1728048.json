The performances were first rate, particularly Annette Bening. Denzel Washington\u0027s soliloquy in the lavatory, directed at Bening and Bruce Willis\u0027 characters as the torture of a believed terrorist captive was being contemplated, sent chills up my back when I first saw it and produces the same reaction in me when I see it now. This movie should be viewed if for no other reason than this one scene alone. It is very powerful and Denzel\u0027s delivery is flawless. \n\nIt\u0027s interesting to read the change in tone of the reviews in this venue, from the initial release of this film, to the reviews post 9/11. When I first saw this film I was overwhelmed by the thought of the types of events portrayed actually occurring on U.S. soil, particularly after remembering the first, largely unsuccessful bombing of the World Trade Center a number of years earlier, which occurred in the garage of the building. I remember thinking \"what would have happened if that building had fallen over?...a lot of people would have been killed\". The U.S. should have taken steps to beef up national security beginning THEN. If you recall, there was a boycott of this film by Muslim factions world wide, and if I remember correctly, a theater was bombed because the theater insisted on showing trailers of the upcoming release of this film. Let\u0027s not forget about people like Timothy McVie and also groups like the Branch Dividians. Terrorism can be home grown too.\n\nAnyhow, this movie is great with fine performances by Washigton, Bening, Willis and especially Tony Shalhoub (in this pre-Monk performance) as the agent torn between duty and heritage. The story unfolds well, screen play, dialog, editing all first rate. In particular I admired the display of the internment camps, the scenes where Marshall law is declared for New York City, portrayal of the lack of communication and sharing of information between governmental agencies, the erosion of civil liberties in the time of extreme crisis. Much loss of civil liberties has occurred since 9/11 in the U.S. and world wide. Current airport security measures is the first example that pops into my mind.\n\nI think this film should have garnered a much higher initial reviewer rating in this venue and I\u0027m quite surprised that it didn\u0027t. This movie is a must see, if you can cope with the possible sorrow and anger it may cause you.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
