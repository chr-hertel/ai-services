He was hilarious and the star of this Popeye animated short. Kudso to either Jack Mercer, Gus Wickie or whomever did the voice work for \"Polly.\" (It\u0027s not listed anywhere.)\n\nPopeye drops the caged bird at the door of Olive Oyl to give her a reminder of him while he\u0027s away at sea. The bird recites poetry, sings and dances and Olive is more than impressed. \n\nThe problem starts when Bluto comes by, hears the parrot wooing Olive and decides to get rid of it. A wild chase ensues out of the house as the bird flees out of its cage and into a tree with Bluto, ax in hand, going after it. The funny stuff is the dialog the parrot uses as he\u0027s being chased - really good stuff and guaranteed to make you laugh. I played it with the English subtitle on, so as not to miss any of it, since it\u0027s so funny.\n\nIt gets really wild when Popeye comes to the rescue, Olive keeps fainting and.....well....all kinds of crazy things happen - a fantastic cartoon!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
