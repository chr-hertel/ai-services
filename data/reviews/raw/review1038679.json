With creative and daring story lines and terrific character development, the show that began its run on the WB as a mid-season replacement, became a dazzling cult hit resulting in a secure fan base and merchandising for as far as the eye can see.\n\nThe show follows a young girl endowed with the ancient powers of the slayer, one girl who fights the forces of darkness, battling alone, relieving the world of vampires and demons. In Buffy Summers\u0027 case, after moving to Sunnydale with her single mother, she befriends two loving, but out of place peers, Willow and Xander, who bravely march along side of her. Together, along with her watcher, Giles, they encounter creatures of darkness and strange mystical occurrences, which as a result, draw them closer together and occasionally, set them apart.\n\nOn occasion, Buffy is mistaken as a foolish, sci-fi television show which should probably be aired during the depressing Saturday afternoon time slot. But actually, nothing could be farther from the truth. A surprising element to Buffy is that the monsters and demons are a relatively small part of what the show actually stands for. From first love, life, death, sexual experimentation, and self identity crises  Buffy chronicles what it is like to be young person growing up in an overly mature world  with monsters! Between a slayer, a lesbian witch, a carpenter, and a werewolf  anything is possible and welcomed in the Buffy world. With the imaginative and extremely innovative writing of the show\u0027s creator Joss Whedon, along with the most intelligent and skillful writing staff that the biz has ever encountered, they were able to produce many groundbreaking episodes including \"Hush\", \"The Body\", \"The Gift\", \"Becoming part 2\", \"Seeing Red\", \"Conversations with Dead People\", \"Grave\", and \"Chosen\"  sadly I cannot continue this list for there is not enough space.\n\nWithout further ado, Buffy The Vampire Slayer is and will always be an incredible show. If you haven\u0027t had the privilege of watching this show, check your local listings for reruns or rent or even buy the entire series on DVD. Without a doubt, you will fall in love with the characters and stories, and by the time you finish the first season you will have welcomed a new family into your lives  sweet and sometimes muddled Buffy, clever and endearing Willow, faithful Xander, perceptive and paternal Giles. This show will linger in our hearts for eternity, and will go on to influence generations of intellectual and audacious writing in television." }
