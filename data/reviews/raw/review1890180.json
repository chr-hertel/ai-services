I agree with ccthemovieman-1, it was silly to rate only this an A.A and not other episodes. Episodes like \"Mad As a Mars Hare\" and \"Bugs and Thugs\" deserve an A.A more than this.\n\nDespite what I said in my previous paragraph, I do think this is a good episode. It has good humour and surprisingly good slapstick (the timing is very good), the King Arthur theme works well and gives a good setting to the episode and the \"quest\" theme for Bugs also gives a good tone to the episode, amid all the slapstick there is indeed a brave quest being done here. This short also has one of my favourite Looney Tunes endings, it is quite calm and peaceful (this is NOT a spoiler).\n\nA singing sword has been stolen from the Knights of the Round Table and King Arthur wants to send one of his knights to go and recover it. None of them are brave enough to face the Black Knight (Yosemite Sam) who stole it and turn, literally, chicken. Then Bugs Bunny, a jester, turns up on the scene and there is a funny plot turn... \n\nI recommend this to people who like Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam teaming up and becoming different characters and to people who like a King Arthur theme in a Looney Tunes episode. Enjoy! :-)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
