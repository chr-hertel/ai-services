All performances (5 of em\u0027) are excellent. And although it\u0027s a little bit talky it\u0027s still never boring. Glad I bought it. I\u0027m also gonna admit that Ellen Page\u0027s face is haunting my mind as of late. She\u0027s really great in \"X-Men 3\" \u0026 there\u0027s just something about her that\u0027s just....well it\u0027s just haunting. I\u0027m positive she\u0027s older than the character she plays in the movie. She\u0027d make a great ghost in a movie. See the movie....You will leave with some questions about morality \u0026 the price of rage. You will surely think about the film for days afterward.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
