The plot seems to borrow bits from various Hollywood sources, such as Shirley Temple and her bungalow at 20th Century Fox in the 30s, etc.\n\nI always enjoy Anne Baxter\u0027s performances, but this comes across as a bit over-the-top. Granted, the script requires that she intentionally overact for Columbo, but at times, her supposed \"natural\" scenes are also a bit camp/vamp.\n\nEven when this first aired in January, 1973, I knew who Edith Head was, and got a kick seeing her cameo.\n\nDirector Quine was also at the helm of my least-favorite episode, the one shown prior to this,\"Dagger of the Mind.\" Both exhibit unnecessary scenery chewing, and stray from the formula that usually makes any \"Columbo\" episode a television classic." }
