But i gotta admit i almost left the theater in the first 10 minutes. You see, im iraqi and my name is Al-Saleem. It was a bit awkward i felt as if the whole theater was looking at me.\n\nAs soon as i got used to that i started enjoying the movie, the plot was amazing. The movie clearly showed amazing understanding the the culture and highlighted cultural differences.\n\nThe directing was pretty good. some of the scenes were a bit questionable mainly because i come from the area and know most of the cities and areas in question.\n\nIt was a fun movie that makes you think. even after i left i still think there\u0027s more to the story than what we have been told.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
