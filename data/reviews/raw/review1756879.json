This movie shows Raimi\u0027s love for slapstick comedy and Bruce Campbell turns in a great performance as Ash once again, Campbell\u0027s one-liners are hilarious but seemed a little too \u0027dummied-down\u0027 if you know what I mean. I feel this movie lacked the technical sophistication that Raimi usually thrived on in earlier films, it seemed a little too sloppy and cheesy in some moments (Raimi never lost his touch there). I was about 80% satisfied with the movie and 20% critical of how it was handled. Overall it is a great, enjoyable and laughter filled picture but the plot just seemed too condensed, I just really feel that the plot could have had more meat on it\u0027s bones, oh well, all in all I\u0027am still glad Raimi came out with this movie and I look forward to another possible sequel in the future if he decides so.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
