Wenders takes HUGE bites out of the philosophy sandwich, and sometimes can\u0027t get it all chewed, swallowed, and digested. I liked his early film \"Hammett\" for its direct story and period feel. \"WingsÂ…\" took on MAJOR issues, but did not lose sight of the need to focus. \"The End of Violence\" wants to be a few films, and none are treated to a full exploration. It\u0027s part crime drama, part marital drama, part Hollywood biz drama, and part exploration on the subjects of privacy, violence, perception, and secrecy. That\u0027s A LOT to pack into one tasty bite, and nothing is fully appreciated. Wim: ease up. Take one subject, make a full film. Then, take another subject, make another full film. You can do it. Again. All of that said, the acting is good, the score is effective, the photography often striking, the characters often interesting, and some scenes are very memorable." }
