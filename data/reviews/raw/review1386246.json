He imparts his medical knowledge on a young protégé (Tobey Maguire) whom he hopes would run the place when he dies. Caine is disappointed when Maguire suddenly leaves the orphanage with a lovely couple (Paul Rudd, Charlize Theron) to experience adulthood in a new place of the world. Maguire\u0027s journeys from which point expose him to realities of love, loss, and sin, all the while recalling the fulfilling life he had when being a medical practitioner and caretaker back home. Will he ever motivate himself to be of use in a way that only he could in Maine?" }
