Does anyone know how I could find her on the internet. I need to do this project in concern with my choice of counseling and I cannot do the research if the story is not a true one. If this women does exist how can I obtain the information I need for my project. I need to find out what steps she took in creating the law and all the proceedings she used to do it. Who was involved with her and how did they find the right ways to go about getting the law passed. Is she planning on a national law for the whole United States or just for California. What gave her the strength to come forward and is she still healing for her abuse?" }
