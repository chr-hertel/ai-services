Forget Godzilla. Python 2 (or, as it is even more awesomely named in the UK \u0027SNAKES\u0027) is truly the defining monster movie of our times, perhaps any times.\n\nSo awesome is this tale of man and reptile, in fact, that the distributors see fit to charge no more than Â£1 for it in bargain basement DVD buckets. So epic is it, that the producers avoided putting any of their or their actors\u0027 or directors\u0027 names on the back of the DVD cover. That there are no special features at all should be of no importance.\n\nWhy, if you squint you eyes and smear your screen with Vaseline you can almost dare to say the CGI Snake looks real. The actors\u0027 performances are so virtuoso they barely move at all on screen. One woman was even included in the cast! The plot tells a weeping tale of tragedy and the folly of over-ambition, as the government (or, some guys with guns at least) try to recapture a big freaking\u0027 snake in a military base somewhere in Russia. Surely some social commentary on our times, friends.\n\nThis movie will change your life. I haven\u0027t even finished watching it yet and I am moved to review it on IMDb.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
