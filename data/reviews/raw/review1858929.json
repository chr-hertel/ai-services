He is credible in this movie more then Kumar because finding the girl from the first one, the only thing I guess I didn\u0027t enjoy was the second half of the movie, first half was very well written but the second half could\u0027ve been better, and the ending was the whole best part about the movie, I was shocked to see the way the movie ended, I was happy for the way the director added that famous person from the first movie, Forgot his name but still it was a good movie, everyone who is a harold and kumar see this one, you will not be disappointed!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
