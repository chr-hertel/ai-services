I have found it incredibly boring due to the uninterrupted stream of clichés and obvious images: a massive bureaucracy represented by mindless drones dressed in the same impersonal way; the dehumanization represented by people oblivious to bombs going off next to them; the hero who doesn\u0027t fit and dreams, of course, of flying and finding a beautiful woman (I admit the wings are well done and provide a beautiful image).\n\nA movie can be excused, and indeed lauded, for being full of clichés when it was the one actually introducing them. But these images are very old. Orson Welles\u0027s \"The Trial\" and \"Blade Runner\" (released merely three years before) come to mind. One can make the point that the clichés are somehow a reference to those movies, as well as to a noir atmosphere, but it is just pointless and not interesting.\n\nTerry Gilliam seems to have learned a lot since them; \"The Twelve Monkeys\" is one of my favorite movies.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
