Nothing about THE INFORMER is subtle. It\u0027s all told in the broadest way possible--even Max Steiner\u0027s score only punctuates the dismal feel of the whole maudlin story.\n\nVictor McLaglen is \"the informer\" in Dublin during \"the troubles\" (when weren\u0027t they in trouble???), and it\u0027s quite a melodramatic turn he does here as the brute of an Irishman who drowns his paranoid feelings of guilt with any drop of whiskey available, in what was to become a typical Victor McLaglen hard-drinking trait in many a John Ford film.\n\nWallace Ford is the friend he squeals on; Una O\u0027Connor is the mournful mother of the dead man who does a complete turn at the end of the film and forgives her son\u0027s killer in the film\u0027s most implausible and contrived moment; Preston Foster is the Commandant in charge of finding out the name of the informer; and Heather Angel is the girl whose brother has been killed. J.M. Kerrigan does a good job as the little hanger-on of a man who praises McLaglen as long as he has money to throw around after the foul deed--a sad commentary on human nature.\n\nBut for a film that has been acclaimed for years as a John Ford masterpiece, it is no such thing. It\u0027s a trial to watch with some of the dialog so over the top into cornball territory that you won\u0027t know whether to laugh or cry. The script has a simplistic view of the Irish Rebellion of 1922 and their troubles and the film\u0027s ending is more laughable than poignant.\n\nMcGlaglen is either tipsy or staggeringly drunk through the entire performance, much as he is in many a John Ford film--except that here he was an awarded an Oscar for his performance. I suppose it\u0027s an Irish trait that can\u0027t be denied--but Ford\u0027s insistence on magnifying the drinking habits of his traitorous protagonist gets a bit wearisome before the story is half told. \n\nBy today\u0027s standards, not the classic it once was. The soundtrack makes scant use of Max Steiner\u0027s score which won an Oscar as did John Ford\u0027s direction.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
