Not so for me with this one. Ron Howard, in my opinion, deserves an Oscar for his brilliant direction. I was impressed at how closely the movie followed the book. Tom Hanks was superb as always and so was Paul Bettany as the evil monk Silas. Ian McKellen is a great actor and his portrayal of the rather insane Sir Leigh Teabing was excellent. I\u0027m not very familiar with any of Audrey Tautou\u0027s work so it\u0027s hard to judge whether the role of Sophie Neveu was one of her best performances. I thought she did a pretty good job. Both the book and the movie made me think about and question my religious upbringing quite a bit and that is a good thing, I think.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
