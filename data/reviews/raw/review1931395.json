People who want to be crippled from the waste down and confined to a wheelchair.\n\nIt is more than that. It\u0027s set within a mystery as to whether a radio reporter is getting lured into a trap or fake story. And unlike Crash, there\u0027s no drug connection. It\u0027s more psychological, but equally dark, simply without the ambiance and style that Crash had.\n\nThe downside is that some of it seems too setup and the story under-developed. The result is that it seems less like a theater film and more like a TV movie, but worth watching.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
