The other show that would even come close to comparing with this show is the Simpsons. Its got four great characters (Jerry Seinfeld) (Cosmo Kramer) (George Costanza) (Elaine Benes) and without a doubt the best one of the four characters has to be Cosmo Kramer. I would have to pick Kramer because he is a very funny character. Another reason i like Krmaer is because all of the funny movements that he does and the way that he slides through the door with everyone clapping for him. For Jerry Seinfeld one thing i like about him is the comedian acts he does before and after the show. The comedian acts he does before the show is usually stuf that are going to happen during the episode they are about to play. The one right before the end is usually what him talking about the end results of the last episode being played. This show is truly one of my favorite shows of all time and i give it a 10/10." }
