I absolutely loved the locations they chose to film, the songs were well written and interesting, especially the psychedelic sounding track on which Hans Matheson sings. It\u0027s trippy. Nighy was fab in his role, Nail \"nailed\" it, Beano was the typical drummer, and Rea kept it together. Bruce Robinson was awesome. Helena was a lovely girlfriend. But I felt Juliet Aubrey\u0027s performance was gorgeous. The scenes between Aubrey \u0026 Robinson killed me! Perfectly played and the music behind the scene was spot on! Too bad not many more musicians have checked this movie out! They ought to!I\u0027ve told all my musician friends. great quote by Jimmy Nail\u0027s character: \"it\u0027s supposed to be rock \u0026 roll, not the Phantom of the f*****g opera!\"", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
