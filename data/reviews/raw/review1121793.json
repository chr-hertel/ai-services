That does not however have to be a bad thing, since the story is well told, and does not hurry. The actors in the movie play very convincing and sincere.\n\nAfter the end-credits rolled on my TV I was quite blown away, but also started asking questions to the last 10 minutes of the movie... I couldn\u0027t make the calculation to add up. After an hour or so, I realized, that is just the way it is supposed to end, that could be a reality everywhere.\n\nI have two words for you: \"See it!\"", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
