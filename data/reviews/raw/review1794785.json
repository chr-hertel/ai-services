I thought the first episode was alright, but it just got better and better. Sure there are a couple of social comments, but I think they are sensible ones. Its a shame its been cancelled... I wonder if its because of all the religion, war, politics and behind the scenes of TV? I thought it was an interesting concept, maybe one that some of the US weren\u0027t ready for?\n\nStudio 60 is witty and smart. It is a funny, yet also serious. The actors were great and I was looking forward to watching the next episode week after week.\n\nI really hope it comes back, because let\u0027s face it- we need this kind of show on our TVs! Reality TV is annoying, we need shows that make us think!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
