For those of you thinking DJ and PMT would make some some of pastel pop-up cameo, not a chance. Relentlessly dark, grim and utterly without humor, Miami Vice 06 shares little with its\u0027 1984-1989 namesake other than chasing the same \u0027ol drug lord/bad guys. By the way, after twenty plus years, can we PLEASE come up with villains or threats more than the usual South American drug traffickers? BEEN THERE, DONE THAT! \n\nStill, the firefight at the end of the movie ranks with the best of Mann\u0027s mastery of action set pieces. Not quite the level of the street-in-front-of-the-bank shootout during Heat (Wow, talk about feeling part of the action, I\u0027m still checking to see if I\u0027m hit).\n\nI\u0027m a huge fan of Michael Mann\u0027s (\"action\") works: Thief (arguably, his best), Manhunter (even after twenty years, TRULY frightening) and of course, Heat and Collateral, but I get the feeling the Miami Vice 06 just marks time until Arms and the Man comes out next year.\n\nMiami Vice 06? Fun and fast, but forgettable.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
