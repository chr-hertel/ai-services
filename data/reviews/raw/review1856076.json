But the movie was the worst one I have ever seen, too much of it was shot with the hand held camcorder, My wife and I were bored stiff with this movie. Don\u0027t waist you your money on it. I have to right ten lines of text for this to be put in the comments about the movie but I think I have said enough is enough is enough, the movie\u0027s crap and that\u0027s it. So the rest of this comment will be unreadable just so I can speak my mind about Cloverfield. I would not wish this movie on anyone, if you fancy watching it, rent it and you will be disappointed with it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
