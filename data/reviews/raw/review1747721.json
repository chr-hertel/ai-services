The film is just a silly Chinese version of Indiana Jones and, sadly, it was better off not being parodied and/or being rehashed. \n\nWatch it if you absolutely need to see anything with Jet Li in it, but don\u0027t come complaining to this IMDb board exclaiming on how disappointed you were !", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
