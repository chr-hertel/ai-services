Miami. the stories and production in both those shows, normally involve a lot of imagination and are technically excellent, for a television show.\n\nunfortunately, this is a two hour movie. the story, the acting, the directing, the editing, the music are awful. frankly there are NO redeeming aspects of this film.\n\nmy last words on this film are: two hours of your life, you will NEVER, EVER, EVER get back!!! when you\u0027re on your deathbed and begging death for more time, to be with your family or to swim with dolphins or just to sit in the park, he\u0027s going to ask you one question \"did you sit through ALL of goal?\" you\u0027ll know what answer to give him....", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
