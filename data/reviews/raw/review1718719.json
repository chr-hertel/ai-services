No. Criminal?? Yes.... But Most Importantly; Not For Criminologists.", "reviewBody": "On a criminological point of view this film is absolutely moronic and the plot strings together in a ridiculous fusion. Alfred Hitchcock is heralded as a genius though there are very noticeable and unforgivable flaws in his work. A much superior film he directed is Rear Window\", but even in that film he displays a ridiculous plot point of where the girl is saved by the police who show up roughly only a minute and a half after they have been called...... If only In the real world. Anyhow, compared to \"Rear Window\", this film is very mediocre and frankly it is unfathomable how it reached the top 250 movies list. I do not really wish to divulge many spoilers but the viewer deserves some substance to my criticism.\n\nThe plot consists of 2 men meeting on the train. One of them a little mentally disturbed who wishes to kill his father and discovers that the other man, a famous tennis player is at odds with his wife. In the end the deranged man has this idea of the perfect murder where each of the 2 men will \"do the other man;s murder\" problems: When the deranged man murders the man\u0027s wife, he first waits outside her house for possibly hours, then follows her and 2 of her male friends to an amusement park, all through the park, ride after ride intent on killing her, and she never finds his presence odd. Finally after getting off the boat ride with her companions the man follows them where she LUCKILY gets separated so the man can commit...... the PERFECT MURDER.... apparently because the 2 men FOUND her body they are immediately ruled out as suspects... Remind me the next time I kill someone to do it in a dark park and be the first one to find them... Now in Hitchcock land the number one suspect is... her HUSBAND, whos only alibi at the time of the murder is a drunkard on a train back to his home in another town... how the killer managed to reach his house to meet him before he got there first I have no idea. Without being able to go much further before ruining the plot, all this time the psychotic man is holding onto the initiated lighter of the tennis player as an insurance policy that he will \"do HIS murder\" by killing his father, otherwise the psycho man threatens to drop the lighter at the scene of the crime. This is the laughable part; All the while, the tennis player is afraid to call the police on the madman for fear of being involved..... even though he is stalked...... even though the crazy man shows up at his second wife\u0027s fathers estate party and nearly strangles a woman to death without being invited. He was even seen at the murder site while the tennis player was far away on a train. But no... Intelligence equals lack of plot in this movie. In REAL LIFE cases such as this, the 2 men would have AGREED to this insane so called perfect murder idea and perhaps later the 2nd man decides to back out. In the first place were it to work, it would be awkward and difficult to maintain no proof that the 2 ever met (as evidenced in the movie).\n\nIn short; Hitchcock may be entertaining to mystery lovers, but he is lamentable to crime lovers, because here the whole story appears very implausible and slapped together. His only range for brilliance consists of an entire movie centered around setting of a man who can do nothing but look out of his apartment window. (Rear Window) It is very funny to me how Alfred Hitchcock is so heralded because the very same caliber of film made for example by the likes of Dario Argento, today would only get as high as a 6.0 rating at best. If you don\u0027t believe me, by all means, view a Dario Argento movie and you will witness no less originality and no more plausibility.... The difference between MORE or LESS, being at a give and take basis.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
