By signing a pact, they swear to be themselves, free and young in a cruel world dominated by feminism and to taste to many kind of pleasures and experiences. Then \"Les Invincibles\" makes a funny parallel with super heroes, transposing their \"real life story\" into a comic strip.\n\n\"Les Invincibles\" presents 4 kind of guy: the rational (PA), the explorer (Steve), the artist (RÃ©mi) and the submitted (Carlos). Among theirs adventures and discoveries, we feel the value of friendship, solidarity and pride. We also remember how women are complicated;) I\u0027ve seen all the episodes and I\u0027m proud to be a male! Les Invincibles rules!" }
