It seems to be flogging the same old concepts when it comes to plot. The trend at the moment is to saturate the show with as much suspense and as many \u0027possible out-comes\u0027 as ... er .. possible! Invasion is nothing really new and offers little in the way of affection for any of the characters. Most are very attractive people; well-toned, but void of personality, so when they have an interesting plot line or something horrific happens to them, it\u0027s difficult to feel any sorrow for them. Invasion, like LOST, take a basic idea for a show and over-stretch it if it seems to have a trace of popularity to it. The result being end-of-series-episodes that give the viewer a pointless anti-climax (see LOST series 1) Series don\u0027t seem to be given enough time to grown on people, so that the views can have a genuine like or dislike to a character. It can be possible - Quantum Leap and The District (in my opinion) are perfect examples of this. Quantum Leap: Time travel, but the different leaps offer so much detail into both the main and sub-characters being. The District: Crime/Lives of an average US precinct; easily reaches out into the problems and lives of the people who work there. Invasion might have been OK five or six years ago, but now, its just a bit of a generic lemon - samey and sour." }
