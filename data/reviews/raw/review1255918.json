Where the latter is sharp, witty and well-written with excellent special effects, the former is cheap, hammy and corny with virtually no special effects to speak of. What Donald Sutherland thought he was doing in this film defies belief, but he is by far and away the best thing about this film - maybe it is literally so he can say that!\n\nThe plot tells how Buffy (Kristy Swanson) became a Vampire Slayer in the first place, including her early training and her first watcher Merrick (Sutherland). She must adjust from being a normal teenager in LA with nothing to worry about except boys, clothes and cheerleading, to the chosen one with the weight of the world resting on her shoulders.\n\nIt\u0027s amazing that such a terrific TV series could come out of such an abysmal movie. Very little seems to survive from the film to the series, except the name of the main character. None of Joss Whedon\u0027s sly tongue-in-cheek self-awareness is here, and nor is the superb dusting process when a vampire is staked. There is also none of the genuine spookiness here that some of the episodes would contain. What we are left with is vampires that look like demonic versions of Mr Spock, complete with pointed ears - Sesame Street\u0027s Count had more menace. The acting is almost universally awful, with Sutherland being the only saving grace of the film; even Rutger Hauer has nothing to be proud of here.\n\nOne of the few things that makes the film worth watching is that of the big screen debut of one Hilary Swank, who even under the horrendously clunky dialogue and clich√©s 90s manages to show real talent; something that is sadly lacking in the rest of the cast\u0027s hideously over-the-top performances.\n\nThe film is only of value to the completists who want the complete works of Joss Whedon; it is little more than a historical curiosity which shows how bad Buffy the series could have been, but thankfully wasn\u0027t.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
