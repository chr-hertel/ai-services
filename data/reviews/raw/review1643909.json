In fact, here\u0027s the summary: A drug addict history teacher and a clever young black student develop a strong friendship and end up changing each other\u0027s lives. Sound boring? I thought so but the raving about Ryan Gosling and his Oscar nominated performance attracted me and plus I\u0027ve got a lot of free time in my hands as well. By the way, he was brilliant for an actor of his experience and definitely deserved the nomination....but just the nomination since he really had no chance against Forest Whitaker (The Last King of Scotland). Anyway if you start watching the movie and you think \"Damn! This is too slow and the plot isn\u0027t going anywhere\" don\u0027t give up just bear with it till the end and I guarantee you\u0027ll feel fully satisfied and that you\u0027ve just watched a brilliant piece of art. \n\nThe message is another thing to rave about as well because the movie isn\u0027t only trying to tell the viewers that \"drugs are bad...especially if you\u0027re a teacher\" but also you\u0027ll note that the main character (Ryan) has no racial distinction. And he feels that Blacks and Whites shouldn\u0027t be judged differently and it will probably make anyone who watches it feel the same way....or at least most of us (I really can\u0027t imagine a member of the KKK\u0027s view of black people alter in the slightest after watching it.) But the message is powerful and beautiful and I felt very good inside after watching it. My point here is that don\u0027t only expect an amazing performance but also an amazing movie in general. I\u0027d give it 7/10.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
