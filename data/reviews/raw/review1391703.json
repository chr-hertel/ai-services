This is filmed in black and white to add atmosphere, or make it more Italian or something. The characters make no attempt to speak Italian, or even to put on an Italian accent. In my opinion this adds greatly to the comedy. Their diet consists of a choice between spaghetti hoops or haunted house pasta shapes. Poor Aldo Vini (Nigel Planer), a top banker, has embezzled 200 million, and the net is closing. But that\u0027s enough plot for now, no spoilers. Anyway plot isn\u0027t as important as the slapstick national stereotypes and farcical locational devices (shot entirely in London, but characters saying things like \"I can\u0027t stand this Tuscan heat\"). Dawn French\u0027s character is straight out of a Fellini film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
