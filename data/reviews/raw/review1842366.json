The widower ultimately becomes enamored with and fascinated by one particular young woman...but first impressions can often be horribly wrong....\n\nI guess I\u0027ve heard a lot about this film. I thought, if I remember, it was called a classic to some. Sad, I was really looking forward to it. It turned out to be like any other type of revenge-like flick with a confusing narrative. It was a mess! The more I think about it, the more I start to hate it.\n\nIt began off well. I could see the potential. Honestly, this is a great, character-driven film but wasn\u0027t this sold as a horror film? Wasn\u0027t it supposed to be scary? Why didn\u0027t anything happen until the last 30 minutes of the film? I think I might be in the minority for not liking this film because I don\u0027t know what type of message this movie was suppose to say.\n\nEven if the film didn\u0027t have a message (which it obviously did), what was the point making this film? Was it suppose to entertain because I certainly wasn\u0027t. I guess it was shocking, funny, and creepy at times, I\u0027ll give them credit for that but it was pointless when you look back.\n\nThe performances were good but I just don\u0027t see the point. Is this trying to be a shocking film? Was the message supposed to be \"Looks can be deceiving\"?\" In the end, this film leads you to more questions than answers, which I\u0027m not saying is a bad thing, but all I think this film tries to do is make you confused, irritated, annoyed, and half-satisfied. No, this is not a film for everyone and it certainly is not for me.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
