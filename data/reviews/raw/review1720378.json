He has one camera method for everything which is shaky camera. The plot is ludicrous, the female lead Megan Fox looks like a 38 year old Polish pole dancer. This film was so loud I couldn\u0027t even hear myself think and didn\u0027t have a clue what was going on. The film attempts emotional moments which it really never earned enough for them to make sense. This is the first time I have walked out of a theatre before the end of a film and I will be sending Mr Bay a letter demanding my Â£5.60 back I am actually disgusted that this film had an average of 7.8 and was on the IMDb top 250. (I have now seen that it has fallen to 7.7 and off the top 250 list, give yourselves a pat on the back people you are now karmically balanced!)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
