But what an entertaining piece of junk!\n\nI\u0027ve never seen so many men dressed in blue mini skirts in my life! And let\u0027s not forget the blue tights as well. it\u0027s like watching an episode of the Smurfs in Space!\n\nI\u0027ve never seen so many terribly crafted MDF settings/furniture since the last time i watched a home improvement show on British TV. \n\nI\u0027ve never seen so many stupid wigs since Cher\u0027s last world tour! And imagine the results when you use them together with silver space suits and silver body paint! Wow!\n\nAs you can understand I never even bothered to notice the plot or even the fact that the person who translated the script from Italian, probably didn\u0027t speak English.\n\nBut what really surprised me about this film is that even though we are surrounded by all this space hi-end technology, it seems that none of the female space crew even know what a push-up bra is, and the wonders it can do for your figure....", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
