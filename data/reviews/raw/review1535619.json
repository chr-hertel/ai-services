He\u0027s got a rubber-band voice and a face that moves in every possible direction, and each scene in this movie takes Ernest\u0027s seed of an idea in some really interesting directions. It was really nice seeing a movie where whoever has copyright control over the Ernest character finally said, \"Okay Jim, why don\u0027t you go nuts,\" which is basically what happens here: just a string of scenes about Ernest\u0027s relatives or ancestors where Jim Varney plays basically everybody. Definitely worth renting on a Friday night.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
