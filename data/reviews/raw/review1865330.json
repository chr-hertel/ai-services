This year we follow a couple of schools from inner-city areas and the pupils who find themselves sucked into the competitive dance-offs despite the reservations some of them feel.\n\nThis film was billed as \"this year\u0027s Spellbound\", which was both a smart marketing move but also an unhelpful comparison. In regards the subject then it is a fair comparison because it deals with school kids in competition but unfortunately the quality is not quite as high. The weakness here is in the delivery and structure because I think it tries to throw its net too wide, taking in groups rather than individuals. As a result it never brings out specific characters as well as Spellbound did and as a viewer I never got engaged with individuals that much. In the general sweep approach though the film does work as a rather fun documentary. The kids are all wonderfully \"Noo Yark\", \"BK\" etc clichés and there is a certain pleasure in watching them get engaged in the dancing and enter into the competitive spirit.\n\nIn a very white, middle-class way I suppose I\u0027m suppose to take something bigger from this and certainly some of the reviews have come across as being \"moved\" in a rather condensing way. But this is the downside of having \"underprivileged\" (read \"non-white\") kids as a general group and not bringing individuals out apart from here and there  they become a mass and not a subject. The dance contests and the sass of the pupils does give it enough energy to carry it along but outside of this there is not a lot to get from it and I rarely found myself engaged in a general competition that I had little personal stock invested in. The classes focused on are all quite fun but again I did want the individuals to be brought out more.\n\nOverall then a colourful and quite fun film with plenty of energy but a weakness in the approach and structure. Unlike Spellbound we don\u0027t really have individuals that we can follow but rather groups and this approach stops stories and morals coming out. The result of this is an OK documentary but nowhere near as strong or as interesting as it could have been and in regards the quality of the film it certainly does not deserve its comparison with Spellbound." }
