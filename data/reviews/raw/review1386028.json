This film just drips quality throughout with its terrific direction, acting, singing, writing and production. While not the best MGM film ever made, it certainly is among the best musicals they made. That\u0027s because not only are there a modest number of songs, but those in the film are awfully enjoyable--particularly the final song, HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE Christmas. It was pure magic and is probably Judy Garland\u0027s best adult performance--she is radiant and on the top of her game.\n\nI think another reason I love this movie so is that it is not just a bunch of songs thrown at the audience, but a very enjoyable slice of life film about a wonderful family filled with great characters. From the tough but loving father to the bratty littlest child (played by Margaret O\u0027Brien in her best performance), they all are special and sweet without being too saccharine.\n\nThis makes a wonderful Christmas movie and is best viewed on Christmas Eve with the lights turned low.\n\nFYI--If you have a chance, get a hold of the wonderful two-disk set. The second disk has an amazing set of extras--enough to keep you very busy and very happy. One of the shorts, \"Bubbles\", is NOT good but still well worth seeing despite its creepy characters, as you get to see Judy Garland performing like a pro at age 7!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
