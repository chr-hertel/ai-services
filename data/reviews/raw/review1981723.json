He thinks he is the funniest man alive, the greatest boss ever and that he isn\u0027t prejudice in any way.\n\nWatch the show and find out how much is actually true.\n\nRecommended for everyone, except anyone who has problems with embarrassing situations. 9/10. Marvelous!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
