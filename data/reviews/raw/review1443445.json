His acting is atrocious, his accent unbelievable, his character stupid. Even if the plot wasn\u0027t thin, this character still ruined the film entirely. With his omission, a better character could have been in the film, but then I guess the film would have been more like Disney\u0027s Cars.\n\nOn a positive note, the race scenes were great, and the relationship between Ricky Bobby and his best friend, Cal, brought many laughs to the audience. The actors who played the pit crew and Ricky\u0027s father were all great. The two women in the Ricky Bobby\u0027s life had great moments, but Amy Adams did some overacting on more than one occasion.\n\nWait for the video release, and then make your friend pay for it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
