This screenplay is totally new in its form because it follows this woman from the beginning to the end and is just a kind of diary of her life. It\u0027s not based on facts and different characters : most of the characters are watched just once. Nothing is permanent apart from the woman. This woman is played by Jeanne Balibar and the trip brings her from Italy to the UK. Although the screenplay is not full of action and suspense, the story creates a kind of deep mystery about this woman and the reason why she makes that kind of trip. When you start watching this movie, you first think that it\u0027s boring and pointless but if you watch it to the end, you\u0027ll see a kind of splendor and a kind of charm of these people, this woman and this story : a hidden meaning. The story is about the mystery everyone carries in its own identity. The director seems to ask us : Who are we ? What are we made of ? What are we like ? The woman, played by Jeanne Balibar is totally fascinating. Her face is from the beginning to the end fascinating, mysterious. The most incredible moment of this movie is the end. We see that mysteries will always be mysteries and that women will always be mysteries before the eyes of a lover. Jeanne Balibar is the key of this movie. She puts into it a kind of beauty and fascination which make the story work. Esther Gorentin is also absolutely great in the role of the widow of this writer who never wrote.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
