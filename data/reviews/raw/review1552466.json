I was very disappointed when I saw the new shows with the Montelongos. I\u0027ve been meaning to log on and find out why Trademark is no longer the focus. I never expected to see such a huge backlash towards A\u0026E, and that so many people share my opinion.\n\nArmando Montelongo is an arrogant jerk. It\u0027s completely nauseating how everyone around him is so subservient! It\u0027s hard to pick which of them to loathe the most - Armando for being so cruel and demeaning or the wives for being so obnoxiously servile. They all get under my skin. I watched a few of the shows but I was so irritated and disgusted that I can\u0027t watch anymore.\n\nAside from their apparent moral and ethical deficiencies, their work was substandard. One episode that stands out is the mushroom growing toilet, when Armando planned to slap some superficial fixes on top of that festering plumbing / foundation mess. Thankfully he went on vacation when the final decision was made. If that\u0027s they way he works I\u0027d hate to see his other properties.\n\nI miss Trademark. I wish the show would have stayed with them. If the show continues, hopefully A\u0026E will take a hint. I\u0027ll be watching out for Trademark on other networks.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
