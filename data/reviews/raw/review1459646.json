The production turns out to be a front used by the Russian mafia (in conjunction with local police) to launder money. When Michael Keaton\u0027s character (the compliance officer) starts sniffing around, the bad guys decide to frame him for murder. And, because the local cops are involved in the scheme, they plan to catch and kill him. So, he\u0027s on the run in Europe and gets aid from a couple of other characters who get drawn in as well.\n\nAnyways... the point of this review is not to tell you about the movie, but to save you money. This movie is not even mildly entertaining. It\u0027s worse than most \u0027made for TV\u0027 flicks you\u0027ve seen. It\u0027s actually even worse than some pornos I\u0027ve seen. It was obviously a \"C\"-level movie that got bumped up to \"B\" level because it has actors like Caine and Keaton in it. However, even though they are, as always, good actors, they still can\u0027t save this train wreck of a film. Bad writing and bad production meet head-on in what turns out to be an embarrassingly bad movie. I think the only entertainment value is as a \"what NOT to do\" lesson in film school. It\u0027s actually kinda funny (in a sad way), because it\u0027s so bad.\n\nThere are goofs in almost every scene, aside from the cheesy lines and plot holes. I\u0027m not angry or being vindictive. It\u0027s simply the truth. I actually went into this movie with high hopes because I love Keaton. But this is just such a waste of time, I\u0027m trying to save anyone else from accidentally renting it. Anyone who gave this movie a good review is actually working for the distributor or production company. It\u0027s not even debatable, it\u0027s soooo bad, and the goofs are so glaring.\n\nI honestly assume that the reason Keaton and Caine signed on was because they owed someone a favor, or because it was a slow time for them \u0026 they got to take their families on vacation in the South of France for free.\n\nGoofs and plot holes from beginning to end. Look for the blinking corpse at the beginning, and look for Caine\u0027s ventriloquism near the end.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
