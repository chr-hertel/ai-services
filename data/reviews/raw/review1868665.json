Some are clever and engaging; this one is a by-the-numbers plot with the cheap production values you\u0027ve come to expect from Monogram.\n\nThe \"McGuffin\" of the plot is a bomb in a suitcase, which has been mistakenly switched with a suitcase full of Nazi spy information. Of course, the bomb ends up on a moving train, which the director reminds us of incessantly with shots of the bomb-laden suitcase superimposed over a moving train. There is little actual tension on board; it\u0027s more like a commedia dell\u0027arte farce with people moving in and out of various rooms, carrying suitcases, tying people up, etc.\n\nThe Nazi spy ring is full of dopey-looking American actors. How can we tell that they are Nazis? Why, they use the required words \"dummkopf\" and \"schweinhund,\" and do a lot of bossing other people around.\n\nThe B-grade cast has virtually no chemistry. The \"romances\" and \"buddy plot\" never really click. There are so many GOOD WWII spy films; don\u0027t waste your time on this predictable potboiler.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
