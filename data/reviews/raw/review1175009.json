I did see the original BBC series too... this movie compares very well. Colin Firth\u0027s Darcy was intriguing and well-played in the old version, which originally gave me a fascination with the story, and compelled me to read the book. Matthew Macfayden\u0027s Darcy is also brilliant; he smoulders with hidden layers of passion and turmoil, with an engaging edge of vulnerability. He is able to convey a worried, haunted look in his eyes that speaks eloquently of his thoughts. This worked well in the BBC\u0027s Spooks spy series (when his character went off the rails)... he uses it to powerful effect in Pride \u0026 Prejudice too.\n\nKiera\u0027s Elizabeth is not as plain as the one described in the book, but it does not really matter, as Kiera completely inhabits her character, with a lively, spirited cheekiness that lights up the screen.\n\nJudy Dench was magnificent in her role... formidable! At times even her (very tall)hair seemed to quiver with an air of imperious rage.\n\nI would recommend this film to anyone who loves Jane Austen, costume dramas, satire and romantic comedies. And anyone who is a fan of any of the leading actors... they do not disappoint at all!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
