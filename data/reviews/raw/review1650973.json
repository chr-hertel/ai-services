I did see the first, did not bother with the second, and as there was nothing on at the moment that was the final choice. My son is a fan but feared that I would come away grumbling how bad the film was and that.\n\nNot the case. Sure, the ending dragged on a bit, and it is good to get away from a cinema theatre with too many noisy kids inside, ( why, oh why, in Egypt do they let young kids - and I mean babies - into the cinemas ), but I did enjoy the film rather a lot.\n\nThe evil characters, with their completely different characteristics, for me the Sandman was by far the best, and their varying motives and agendas, as well as the split personalities of Spiderman, ( personally I prefer the more conceited or the more evil Spiderman to the original wishy washy version - as I feel that the Police Commissioners daughter would be a much better catch than that boring red headed regular girlfriend ), made for a much better, more entertaining, all round appealing film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
