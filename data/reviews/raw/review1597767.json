The story revolves around the bad guy in town named Bat Haines, who is fooling everybody and plotting two families against each other by stealing each other\u0027s calves and then setting it up so that each one blames the other. He even has the sheriff eating out of his hand and bully\u0027s everyone else to see things his way. If you haven\u0027t guessed yet, he is \"the Terror of Tiny Town.\" Enter the hero, the young son of the Lawson clan, who tries to fix things and stirs up a little romeo \u0026 juliet style romance on the side with a niece in the other family. Well, as you can guess, all things work out in the end and we get to hear one of the silly songs(there are about 4 songs in the movie and all are pretty silly) to close out the movie. This actually was a grand attempt to make a Hollywood picture with only the little ones but the mediocre acting stands out, sadly.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
