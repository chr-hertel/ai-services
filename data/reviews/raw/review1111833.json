This is film isn\u0027t seen enough. I saw it the first time on TCM and was absolutely hooked. I\u0027m a HUGE William Powell fan, and quite identified with a young girl\u0027s fascination with the debonair actor. Had I been a teen in 1943, I\u0027d have been collecting autographs when stars were stars. Virginia Weidler gains a few John Hancocks by the end of the film which is littered with cameos by William Powell, Lana Turner, Greer Garson, Walter Pigeon, and Robert Taylor. This is a fantastically funny movie and if you\u0027re looking for something along the lines of \"The Thin Man\", \"Bringing Up Baby\" and other classics of the era, \"The Youngest Profession\" should quench your thirst.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
