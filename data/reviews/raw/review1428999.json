(it\u0027s been a while since i\u0027ve seen this movie so i might be thinking of something else)After that however the movie only gets worse and worse as the jokes are recycled over and over again and we can\u0027t be bothered even to fake a laugh anymore, not only that but the storyline, which i\u0027ve forgotten, is so weak that there is nothing to fall back on when the slapstick runs out and we can\u0027t be arsed finding anymore problems with the dubbing. Basically the only people that have the energy and short enough memory span to be amused by this all the way to the end are small children and a few mentally severe old people. For the rest of us though the film will be forgotten quickly especially since the most memorable thing in it was the goddamn baby.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
