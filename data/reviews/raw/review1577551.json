Since they are females, he names then \"Miss Canfield\" and \"Miss Landers,\" his two best female teachers ever. \n\nWard brings them home and finds out Beaver was sent home early because he has the chicken pox. He doesn\u0027t want the birds to get \"Pigeon Pox,\" so Wally gets stuck taking care of them while the sick and contagious Beaver stays up in his room.\n\nThe trouble starts when Larry Mondello - who else? - brings over his two pigeons and asks Wally to keep them for the weekend in the cage with Beaver\u0027s pigeons. Larry\u0027s family is staying in a hotel for the weekend, so Wally says okay and puts \"Nate\" and \"Al\" in with Beaver\u0027s birds\n\nComplications arise, first with lice and then with a neighborhood cat killing two of them...but which two, and how to the Cleavers solve this problem without the Beaver getting all upset as he recovers from his illness?\n\nWally turns out to be the one who handles things diplomatically. \n\nWas there ever a better brother than Wally Cleaver?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
