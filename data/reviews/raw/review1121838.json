I was disappointed in the overall production. It was way too long and while there were some scenes with some good acting , Nicholson was not very good--due more to the poor direction and the script than to him.\n\nThe plot was certainly different and very dramatic , the reaction of parents to the death of their young daughter by a man driving his car in a school crossing. It is never made clear if the crossing guard shown in one brief seen half asleep was asleep at the time of the accident.\n\nNot only was the ending far too long , it was completely improbable , Neither actor was a Marathon runner.\n\nYou might want to see it for the same reason I did , viz. to see Jack Nicholson and Angelica Huston ,,but if you are looking for a great movie , look somewhere else.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
