Nagra ) is a young Indian girl who loves to play football but she only plays football in the park with her friends - until \"Jules\" ( Keira Knightley ) , who is already playing in a professional football team for girls , notices Jess great talent and takes Jess with her for one training - and so the chaos begins - Jess doesn\u0027t tell her parents about the team , because they are very traditional and religious people - even wearing football-shorts is scandalous in their point of view . And if that wouldn\u0027t be hard enough , Jess falls in love with her coach - the same boy Jules has fallen in love with ... Inevitable all these confusing circumstances are causing to trouble and Jess begins to realize that somehow she has to make a decision - her parents introductions of an fulfilled live or her dream of playing football as a professional ... Even if this is a typical Hollywood movie with a big happy-end and a predictable story it is a great film to watch ! The actors are very good and it has got a nice comedic action ! Although that film makes you laugh a lot , it also shows you some true problems in our society and this is why \" Bend it like Beckham \" is not only a movie like many others : Living between two cultures can be very hard - also Jess realizes , that it is impossible to link the traditional way of life with the modern way of London-living. These problems and these fascinating actors make it easy for the viewers to identify themselves with the intention of the movie and transferes the main aspects - understanding and respecting different culture - in a humorous way . So all in all - a great movie with a good intention - but what a pity that the story is so formulaic !" }
