It\u0027s actually more stage acting than \"natural acting\" as we know it from average movies and I found that very interesting to see even though it may take a little time to get used to it.\n\nI think that breakfast of champions may be the best movie with Bruce Willis because if you get the message of the film it really goes deep. Maybe seeing the film just once is not enough.\n\nCheers on my first comment in the internet movie data base.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
