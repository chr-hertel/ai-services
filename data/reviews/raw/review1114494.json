Batman Begins has done something I always hoped but never thought possible; it has revived and reinvented a franchise strife with potential but riddled with failure. It\u0027s dark, gritty, and highly original. Forget every other Batman film you have ever seen, the series starts here. I always liked Christopher Nolan\u0027s work and this film has just proved how talented he really is. The action scenes are some of the best I\u0027ve ever seen and the balance of action and story is perfect. Nolan never lets the action over power the character and plot development, which makes for a rich narrative only complemented by action not driven by it. The cast is fantastic throughout Christian Bale fills the role of Bruce Wayne perfectly and Michael Caine\u0027s performance is also very impressive. It\u0027s a visual beauty with a rich story and breathtaking action. Batman will never be the same again.\n\n10 out of 10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
