The only difference is that this fifth part is duller. Very dull.\n\nThis horror film contains all the no-nos of the genre. It\u0027s far too long with its 110 minutes. The look of the movie is utterly bland, and there is no atmosphere to speak of. Almost nothing happens in the first half-hour, and very little much else in the entire movie. There is more focus on the dull non-horror sub-plot regarding a brewing war between the tribe and the military than on the religious stuff.\n\nWhen \"Exorcist II\" came out it was hard to imagine that anyone would ever make a worse entry in this very uneven series (only 1 and 3 are good), but I have to say that this monotonous piece of crap achieves that feat. At least the second part has some camp value, whereas this fifth part is just DULL.\n\nHave I already mentioned that it\u0027s dull? You have been warned..." }
