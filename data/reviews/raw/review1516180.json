They don\u0027t give new great shows a chance to develop an audience. I thought Love Monkey was great. It was funny, good spirited, light hearted, and very entertaining. Too bad CBS pulled the plug on this and continues to produce \"reality TV (what garbage)\" or another ER, CSI spin off.\n\nI think Tom Cauanagh is a very talented actor and the supporting cast was great. Anyway I like ED a lot also. It felt as the show went on that they were beginning to gel together. How long did it take for Friends, ER, MASH to develop a following which allowed those shows to run for up to 10 years?\n\nMaybe one day artists will once again be able to pick whats on our TV\u0027s.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
