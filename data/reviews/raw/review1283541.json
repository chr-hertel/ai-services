I know for most guys they probably may not enjoy it because it is a chic flick. I thought the movie was really cute. I didn\u0027t know much about the movie before i watched it, but i just couldn\u0027t believe what it was about when i watched it. It was a really good romantic comedy,and honestly i haven\u0027t seen on of those in a really long time. I recommend to everyone that you watch it because of how good it is. Reese Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo did such an amazing job. They honestly made a really great movie! I honestly couldn\u0027t believe how cute this movie was. If you don\u0027t know what the movie is about, then i recommend that you go read the plot about it, because it was one of those movies, that was really cute, it would make you screen at the TV,i know i did because i wanted something to happen, and i wasn\u0027t sure if it was or wasn\u0027t going to. I recommend you see it, it is amazing!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
