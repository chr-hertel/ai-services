It says, you people who haven\u0027t been handed wealth/money,the \"American Dream,\" you don\u0027t have to sit around crying about it. You can work hard for success without going doing illegal things, make a better life for yourself other than just \"living in the ghetto\"..that goes for all nationalities. This movie is by no means racist...please. It\u0027s real life, and real life isn\u0027t always \"pretty.\" It\u0027s sad that many people who come from that lifestyle are taught that it\u0027s \"okay\" to be that way, thinking they can never do better. Education, knowledge, wisdom, smarts...that\u0027s your ticket out of the \"ghetto\" lifestyle. Values, morals, SELF ESTEEM for crying out loud! That\u0027s what the message is..take pride enough in yourself not to let yourself be pushed down even though the rest of the world is saying, \"you can\u0027t make it...you\u0027re not good enough\".. this movie is a lesson for all people, in particular black people, who are the main stars in this movie, who need to know they can be more! I want to see more black people in college so that they have the skills to get into the \"white man\" workforce. They have the ability, will they take the opportunity?" }
