Nothing of Ed Wood\u0027s I\u0027ve seen was this bad. This is the height of horror schlock, a thinly veiled continuation of sorts to Universal\u0027s Dracula released by Columbia. Pulling out all the stops in creating the mood of a Universal chiller, you could almost say it was an unfunny attempt at parody. Unfunny anyway in that the director and stars are playing it serious, some of the lines in this are howlers.\n\nBela Lugosi, that one note wacko from Hamsylvania, is on hand reprising his famous Count though this time with a new name \u0026 MO, and a werewolf valet in a suit running his errands. Is it just me, or did Lugosi play Dracula in everything he was ever in? It just seems like it I guess.\n\nAnyway, the script here is strictly a hack job tailored by Columbia for Lugosi in order to make a little easy cash at the box office. The story is ridiculous and full of holes and none of the acting is above the cheese shelf. Nina Foch shows why she became essentially a character actress in the 50\u0027s and 60\u0027s.\n\nThe show is all Lugosi, God help us, with the assistance of a half dozen fog generators and his aforementioned wolf boy. If you like 4th rate crapfests that aren\u0027t nearly as funny as Plan 9 From Outer Space, you\u0027ll love this.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
