Having re-watched recently, the magic\u0027s sorta worn off, but it was still an excellent film. You will thoroughly enjoy this if you like the idea of a humanised robot with real emotions. It\u0027s sorta funny to note how both #5 and Stephanie are slightly naive, and how #5 translates everything into computer language. upon walking in on Stephanie in the bath \"nice software!\" lmao. Also while kids while easily identify Skroeder as the bad guy, adults and teens will recognise how he has basically become more of a machine than the robots he works with because of his inhumanly cold, ruthless attitude.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
