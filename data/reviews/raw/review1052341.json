They are trained by the very mean and strict Lt Thaddeus Harris (my Favourite character throughout the series) and the tough Sgt Debbie Callahan and every man wants her and There is The very forgetful Commandant Eric Lassard who has the least idea of what to do at the academy. They all go through training and have some very funny moments throughout the film but soon they are called in to save the day from a large bunch of rioters and Hightower ends up saving mahoney\u0027s and Harris\u0027s life from the leader of one small band of gang members.\n\na Truly very very very very funny film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
