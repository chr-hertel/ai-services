The film was panned by the majority of the critics who could only find the cinematography worthy of praise. However, Malick was hugely misunderstood by these dumb critics.\n\nThey complain that the film is ponderously slow. This was the intention. Malick used pause to convey that the characters think. Too many actors rattle off their lines without letting their characters think of them. It also conveys the slow pace of their lives.\n\nCritics complain that the characters are too remote - one feels removed from them and can\u0027t get involved. Hello! It is narrated by a 13 yr old and is essentially her view of the events that transpired. Naturally she does not grasp most of the more adult moments between them and thus is herself removed from being fully involved in Bill and Abby\u0027s relationship and that is what has to come across.\n\nThen Malick, in a moment of genius, allied the four main characters to the four elements; Earth, Air, Fire \u0026 Water. Bill is Fire - he is seen at first in front of the furnaces of a foundry where he works. We can see his temper is volatile. Abby is water - in the very first shot she is scavenging(?) by a stream and she is seen against the backdrop of the river. Linda is Earth - In her narration she says that she is close to the \"Oith\". The Farmer is Air - constantly tinkering with his weather vane, and his fields of wheat are often seen waving in the wind.\n\nAll in all a severely mies-judged film and the critics owe Malick a huge apology. The work is pure genius!" }
