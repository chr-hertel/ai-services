Mommy, Die!), this could have been a funny film. but since it takes itself seriously as a horror/slasher film, it just comes across as amateur. the video production is pretty bad too. i don\u0027t even think it is worth watching on video. for free. it\u0027s that bad. and i had really, really high hopes...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
