Normally I am not really into sappy romance movies, because many of them insult my intelligence. But this sentimental drama completely captivates me and I cried and cried and cried again.\n\nIn \"Crying Out Love, in the Center of the World,\" Saku and Aki are two high school classmates in the 80s. They fall in love and use audio cassettes to record their diaries for each other. However, this romance didn\u0027t last forever. And 17 years later, when Saku comes back to his hometown, he is still consumed by his love of his life time.\n\nThe film travels between two time lines seamlessly and never slows down on building up the emotion through a brilliant performance by a terrific ensemble cast. I believe in and feel the love between the characters, which is why I am so deeply moved by their love story." }
