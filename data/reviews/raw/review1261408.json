With this film, the consensus doesn\u0027t matter, it goes straight to the point, but whereas Dogville was a little bit demagogic, this one gives us a lot of different indication, Grace is less one-sided, she fools himself in the trap of slavery, she\u0027s less unreachable, being overwhelmed by her sexual desire, and the film become more exciting and complex. Moreover, there are more events and motion and the film is less boring than Dogville was at the first view.\n\nTo finish i\u0027ll say that Manderlay isn\u0027t only a brilliant sequel to Dogville, but an evolution in narration with a completely different topic", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
