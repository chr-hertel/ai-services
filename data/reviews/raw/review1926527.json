I\u0027d even go as far as to say that it\u0027s funnier than superbad.\n\nJames Franco gives a spectacular performance as a lazy stoner, at times I believed he was actually under the influence...hmmm.\n\nSeth Rogen once again proves he can put on as good a comedic performance as the veteran comics such as Jim Carrey and Will Farrel, His career will definitely go a long way.\n\nThe supporting cast was great and made me laugh a lot which is good since usually you\u0027d be relying on the main actors for a laugh.\n\nI\u0027d recommend this movie mainly for Young adults and teens but if your looking for a silly movie good for a lot of laughs, this is it. 10/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
