Received $50 for standing in the rain without a rain coat, over a 12 hour period! You can see me jumping up and down in the scene (this was \"acting\" designed to show how interested I was in what was going on) where Amy Madigan confronts Dolly about advice given to her boyfriend. When we saw this film in the theatre my daughter and I completely broke up; of course no one else in the theatre could understand why these 2 fools were nearly rolling on the floor laughing.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
