I watched this movie before I rented the remake. The director from the original intended to shoot the movie on 65mm, but didn\u0027t have the money to do so. So he did three blow-ups on 70mm of the film. One of these copies was shown in Karlsruhe and I watched it! I can only recommend to watch it that way! \n\nThe story is quite simple and can be read here at IMDb. What is quite amazing is the complex story/character arc of the main person. Of course there are still some flaws in the storytelling and the usual holes in the plot ... or that\u0027s how you could interpret them. Because those flaws (maybe they are more character flaws?) are pushing this movie into another level (imo). Just don\u0027t expect (Hollywood) Blockbuster action here ...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
