A chance meeting with young Cliff Robertson at a concert brings two people with needs together.\n\nCliff\u0027s needs are much bigger than her\u0027s however. For all his surface charm, the man has some deep issues. Part of which is that he\u0027s grown up without a mother another part of which his father Lorne Greene did him one terrible hurt.\n\nThe film was Cliff Robertson\u0027s breakout role and he does a fine job, running the whole emotional alphabet from the charming and shallow young man who overcompensates a lot to his mental breakdown with Crawford which is terrifying. Crawford gets one of her best late career roles as well. Not much is said about her mental state, but the way she interprets the part, Joan\u0027s needs are as much maternal as romantic and Robertson seems to fill the bill.\n\nFor those of you who expect to see wise and patriarchal Ben Cartwright, that is not the Lorne Greene you see here. In fact before being cast in Bonanza, Greene played a nice variety of nasty people in such films as The Buccaneer, Tight Spot, and this one. Vera Miles is also here as Robertson\u0027s ex-wife and a piece of work herself.\n\nRobert Aldrich does a good job with Joan Crawford and the rest of the cast. But the film really belongs to Cliff Robertson, after this performance, his career was assured.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
