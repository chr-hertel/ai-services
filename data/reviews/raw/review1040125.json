I thought the performances were solid and the story unique enough to hold my attention throughout. Now, I love horror flicks so I know the good from the bad and this one belongs in the same class as the LeCeremonie, Halloween and even a little Three Kings (though that;s not really a horror flick -- the plot mirrors that and the haunted house type genre. But this is a period piece so the special effects are geared toward the supernatural rather than some high-tech effect. A dynamite experience I would recommend to anyone who like an effective thriller.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
