It got my particular attention when the young guy suggested that there should be a united America which is quite interesting. Now these days, Europe has EU, probably one day, there will be indeed a United America.\n\nit also made me wonder if anyone can make a similar movie about someone travel cross country in the US? That would also be interesting to watch. US is also a diverse place.\n\nI have heard about the old movie with the same title, but it was an old movie. So I never got the interest to watch the old one. I think that this one is probably at least as good as the old one.\n\nAfter watching the movie, it made me realize that we are all just people. No matter we are, we all have feelings, what a small world.\n\nAt last, even though this movie is more about working class people, the two main characters are actually typical well educated guys with some money in the pocket.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
