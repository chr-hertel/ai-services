Eisenhower. It\u0027s a film about the hardships of responsibility and leadership, about decisions which you know will cost the lives of perhaps tens of thousands of men. It\u0027s not blood and guts and explosions. It\u0027s weather reports, terse meetings, and agonising decisions.\n\nThere is no action at all in \u0027Ike\u0027. It\u0027s very much a drama and a character study. The ensemble cast is uniformly superb, and none are better than Selleck, who turns in an unforgettable performance. It\u0027s ironic that for the longest time Selleck was relegated to B-movies and lightweight fare, his movie career never really managing to take off. It seemed his famous good looks were to consign him to a brief stint as a TV hunk, followed by a decline into obscurity.\n\nIn \u0027Ike\u0027, Selleck emerges reborn, balding, moustache long-gone, dour, sensitive and intense. If this movie doesn\u0027t finally kick-start his movie career and give him the sort of break that Travolta got with \u0027pulp Fiction\u0027, there is no justice.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
