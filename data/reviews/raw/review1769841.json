Of course when you\u0027ve got a new heavenly retriever on the job like Edward Everett Horton anything is possible.\n\nHe snatches prize fighter Robert Montgomery from a private plane that\u0027s about to crash. Only problem is that Montgomery wasn\u0027t supposed to die in the crash. What to do, send for Claude Rains in the title role as the heavenly fixer, Mr. Jordan.\n\nMontgomery goes through two different bodies after that in an effort to give him the life span that the heavenly records are supposed to have for him. In one of those guises he meets Evelyn Keyes for whom he falls big time and she him. Of course there\u0027s a problem because Montgomery is a millionaire, married to Rita Johnson who with his private secretary, John Emery is trying to kill him.\n\nThrough all of this lending his confused elfin charm is James Gleason as Montgomery\u0027s fight manager. Seems as though Gleason had a destiny also, to manage a heavyweight champion. Gleason got his career role in Here Comes Mr. Jordan as he was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor, but lost to Donald Crisp for How Green Was My Valley. The film itself was Columbia\u0027s entry in the Best Picture category, but also lost to How Green Was My Valley.\n\nThis was Robert Montgomery\u0027s second Oscar nomination and the movie going public accepted him as good natured, saxophone playing pug Joe Pendleton a lot better than the homicidal maniac in Night Must Fall his first and other Oscar nomination. This time Montgomery lost to Gary Cooper in Sergeant York.\n\nMy favorite in this film however is the wise and patient Claude Rains as Mr. Jordan. One thing the film does do is that the end will have you wondering whether the whole thing really was Montgomery\u0027s destiny. Some of Rains\u0027s expressions will keep you guessing.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
