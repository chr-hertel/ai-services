I actually caught this one on the big screen out of curiosity, without seeing a trailer, the poster alone grabbed my eye. I was a bit caught off guard by the singing/dancing numbers at first, but the story and visuals won me over. I enjoy films depicting historical scenes or those in the fantasy setting (Lord of the Rings,etc.)and this had a familiar feel, with the exception of song/dance numbers sprinkled throughout.\n\nI rented the video once I came across it, and to my surprise, my wife and family fell in love with it! To this day, they remember the songs and have their own favorite scenes. I have come to describe it as something \"similar to Braveheart(visually), with songs!\" I can appreciate the story from another culture, being told in another culture\u0027s own way. Miss out on it if you will, but I definitely plan to own this one.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
