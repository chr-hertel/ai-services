Usually when I enjoy a film this much I don\u0027t want to see it again because I don\u0027t want to ruin my memory of how great it was the first time round. \n\nIt came up in conversation with two different people a few weeks ago (when two other couples were talking about a planned wedding for a friend of ours) and I decided this would make a good wedding present. So I ordered the DVD for a gift and when it arrived - I couldn\u0027t not watch it. I ended up ordering another one for the gift and 4 more for others.\n\nThe second time around was a different experience. The movie was actually better. Usually, knowing how something is going to end can ruin the set-up. This time it actually gave it another level of drama and expectation. The richness of the stories and the way they are layered together is so effective because it pulls you in on a purely emotional level. \n\nMaybe my expectations for a \"talking heads\" documentary were very low - but whatever the reason, the thoughtfulness and sensitivity that went into this one just makes for a great movie. The music is to die for and this is one of the few DVDs I\u0027ve ever bought where the extras actually added to the experience of the whole -- rather than demystify and hype the main event.\n\nI\u0027ll add that my husband had no interest in watching the movie and after popping his head in the den a few times to find out why I was laughing, he finally plopped down on the sofa and watched the rest of it with me. Near the end we were holding hands and I looked over and he was totally tearing up. Afterwards he said, \u0027That was pretty good.\u0027 Now he wants to watch the whole thing from the beginning.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
