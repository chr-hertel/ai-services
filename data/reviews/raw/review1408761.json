The Lois Lane character needed a little more testosterone. I like the actress, but the casting could have used a little help. The Star of the movie was a great choice and I look forward to more sequels. There were several scenes where it is obvious he is digitized and looks like animation. There are a few flaws with continuity and the editing is a little choppy. I loved seeing Eva Marie Saint (North by North West). She is one of my favorite actresses of years gone by and I wish she had gotten more screen time. Perry White should have been a little more gruff, but overall the casting was done pretty well. Then, of course there is the cameo by the television Jimmy Olson.... What a treat!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
