I have not seen any for years but they bring back fond memories of lazy Saturday and Sunday afternoons watching wonderful old movies on television. This was, of course, when you had the roof top TV antenna and got 5 (6 if you were lucky)VHF stations and 2 to 3 UHF stations (those too young to remember UHF and VHF - do an Internet search!) While it is true the limited number of stations made programming limited as well it also allowed you to view gems like the Kettle movies - things today you would probably pass over without a second thought. Everyone should watch these movies. They will bring a smile to your face!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
