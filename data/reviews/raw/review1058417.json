All three have their naysayers, but more importantly there are people who believe in them. But, in the end, no matter how wild and unbelievable all three of them seem, one will be declared proof positive, through scientific tests, eyewitness accounts, and good old logic. The question remains, which one will it be? \n\n\"Proof Positive\" is a fast-paced documentary series, and it just boggles the mind as to how the makers cram so much information into each episode. At times, the frenetic editing and camera effects can become a little too much, but each case remains consistently interesting, especially at the end of each episode, where one of them is declared proof positive. Amanda Tapping is a welcome presence, although it does feel as if she\u0027s just acting like how her \"SG-1\" character would do if she was presenting a science(-fiction)-related documentary.\n\nAs the series progressed, however, there came disappointment: Sky One, for one reason or another, broadcast just five of the ten episodes originally produced for The Sci-Fi Channel. But I hope that whoever picks this up for terrestrial broadcasting airs the ones I missed.\n\n~ 8/10 ~" }
