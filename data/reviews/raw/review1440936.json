The philosophical concept was interesting, and it is that that led me to enjoy the first 5 minutes of the movie. But, after the initial concept was revealed 5 minutes into the movie, I found the rest of the move to be completely boring. It amazes me that so many people rated this movie highly. I truly don\u0027t see the entertainment value in the movie that the others reviewers have seen in it (it is currently rated a 7.7, and that blows me away). Being engaged in an interactive philosophical conversation on what occurs in one\u0027s afterlife is entertaining, as is watching a GOOD movie on afterlife such as \"the sixth sense\". But thhis movie, Afterlife, is just plain slow and boring.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
