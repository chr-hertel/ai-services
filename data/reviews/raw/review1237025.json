Although the plot may seem a little dense, and the story does not really have a direction until the end, this movie was all about meanings behind meanings, and hidden messages. The main character, Noi seems to be a trouble maker, smoking, ditching school, and telling off adults. Things slowly begin to change though, when Iris, the daughter of a local bookstore owner arrives. Noi begins to seem some bleak chance of escaping the frozen arena that is his home. Noi wasn\u0027t exactly a tear-jerker, or even a thought provoking movie, it just simply shows how things fall into place, and even if you are in an impossible situation, or seem to be trapped, destiny will show you the way. The ending was a bit too abrupt for me, which was my only compliant of the movie, but looking back at the ending, it fitted the entire theme of the movie perfectly.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
