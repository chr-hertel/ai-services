Their response to this blue sky thinking was to buy up all the trolly companies that they could and close them, putting thousands of trolly workers out of their jobs across the country. Robert Zemekis\u0027 \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" is a brilliant allegory to the actions of General Motors in the 1920s and 30s. Think about it: An untrustworthy corporation, Cloverleaf, buys up all of the Red Car companies and plans on demolishing Toon Town in preparation for the construction of a highway. BRILLIANT! I was able to enjoy this film as a kid, laughing at the toxic relationship that exists between Eddie Valiant and Roger. Now, as an adult, I am able to enjoy it in different ways (historical, sociologically context) while still being able to laugh at the jokes. 10/10!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
