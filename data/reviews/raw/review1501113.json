King even penned the screenplay himself (from his short story \u0027The Cycle of the Werewolf\u0027), but since he was also responsible for the awful Maximum Overdrive, that\u0027s no solid proof of quality. But it a damn cool movie.\n\nWhat makes it so different and unique is that it\u0027s horror movie told from a child\u0027s perspective (though I admit that the retrospective narration seems out of place) and has a brother/sister dynamic that\u0027s quite cute and makes you really care for the characters.\n\nCorey Haim plays Marty Coslaw, a young boy who is confined to a wheelchair for reasons unknown. His older sister Jane is forced to take care of him and throws tantrums whenever the mum and dad take Marty\u0027s side (which is always). But the chair doesn\u0027t stop Marty from being mischievous. Especially when his manic, reckless Uncle Red (a fat Gary Busey-absolutely brilliant, as always) builds him a motorized wheelchair/bike called the Silver Bullet.\n\nThere is killer in their small town who strikes every month when the moon is full. The townsfolk gradually become more and more weary as autumn rolls on and Marty takes a personal offence when his best friend is murdered, his best girl is run out of town and a fireworks display is cancelled. Then he witnesses what the killer really is. But who is going to believe a kid\u0027s story of a werewolf? Despite the red-herrings, it\u0027s easy to figure out who it is before the main revelation. But it\u0027s still a fun mystery.\n\nFilmed with the little-used JDC-Scope process, Silver Bullet has brilliant cinematography by Armando Nannuzzi and a wonderful score by Jay Chattaway. There\u0027s not much horror to it, but I don\u0027t think it was ever the intention to dwell on the violence. Even though I would call this film suitable for kids (despite the 18/R-rating) it\u0027s still way better than the PG-13 junk we get these days.\n\nThe film is also notable for Everett McGill (so evil as the baddie in Under Siege 2), an under-rated and under-used actor in a typically eccentric role as a charismatic Reverend. Doesn\u0027t he look like a cross between Christopher Reeve and David Hasselhoff? \n\nA perfect Halloween movie or any night with the curtains drawn and lights off.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
