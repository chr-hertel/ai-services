Easily one of the best films in the past decade. If you really think about it, it shows how spoiled America is. Thousands upon thousands died a day( and is still going on) just so a man or woman in America can wear a tiny stone on a necklace. The type of thing where once you look at a diamond necklace you really don\u0027t care about it at all. You have to appreciate this movie for the cast. Leonardo is in the possibly best performance of his life. Djimon Hounsou, deserves best supporting Actor. Jennifer Connelly was great. But its the others. Solomons son, the rebel leader, every refugee. You forget that their acting after 10 minutes in the movie. I haven\u0027t seen a movie like that since \"One flew over th cuckoos nest\". Everything you need in a movie is in this. Leo and Djimon were the best on screen duo I\u0027ve seen in years. Better than any Pesci or De niro chemistry.(Over rated) You\u0027ll respect what you have so much more after seeing this and anyone who lives in the \"ghetto\" should be proud of where they are instead of where they could be. . Go see this movie. I didn\u0027t put 10/10 for this movie because no movie is perfect. But if aren\u0027t in awe after watching this movie there is something wrong with you. Enough said", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
