This movie was corny and contrived and reminded me why I always wait for movies to come out on DVD. I was bored out of my mind. And Tom Hanks??? TOTAL HORSEFACE.\n\nThe story was choppy and childish. If this secret has been hidden for thousands of years by some of the most brilliant people in history, why were they hidden by something comparable to a third-grader\u0027s scavenger hunt?\n\nThe whole thing was very lame and disjointed. AND I totally resent that this movie AND book were so popular taking into account that this story is NOT something that\u0027s original OR new.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
