I was not watching a movie, so much as seeing the writing process examined, explored, and enacted on the screen. The director doesn\u0027t mind taking his time to allow events to develop and unfold, and he takes us along with him. Music is used sparingly and effectively - he has faith in his actors and his material. The attention to detail was wonderful - Leonard Schiller wearing shirts and ties many many years old, using spoons and tea cups from another era, sitting on a couch from the 40\u0027s, reading by lamps with pleated shades, walls and cupboards painted many times over, using a typewriter (hearing the clack clack of the keys was music), contrasted by Heather\u0027s tic tic on her laptop, her messy bed in the background, typing by a stylish modern lamp. Lauren Ambrose was the perfect counterpoint to Frank Langella, and the subplot with Lili Taylor as Ariel Schiller and Adrian Lester was touching and effective. At all times, the actors were perfect. They should all win Oscars, but they won\u0027t. Please don\u0027t be fooled by the paltry box office take of $600,000 - this movie is worthy of box office 100 times what it took in.\n\nAnyone with a love of writing, good acting, and wonderful direction should see this movie. Even having Schilling\u0027s body begin to fail him rings true, and is not played for pathos.\n\nAll in all, one of the most enjoyable movie experiences of 2007.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
