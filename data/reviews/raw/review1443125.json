His portrayal of a terminal and morally damaged patient, in search of - and finally receiving - absolution, was flawlessly painful and poignant. This episode is now in my cache for use in class, to illustrate just how perfect a portrayal of an imperfect character can be. As a reviewer and writer, it is often difficult to hold to the suspension of disbelief, an angle is wrong, the lighting is off, a cameraman\u0027s shadow is cast in a scene . . . Rarely is this student of film moved to emotional demonstrations during television dramas, but in this case, Mr. Liotta, thanks for the tears; they came from the depth of my soul. -Maura Coghlan Richardson", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
