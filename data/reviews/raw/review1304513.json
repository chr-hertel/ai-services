It\u0027s so spectacular that the rest of the film almost becomes a letdown.\n\nWhen I first saw this 10 years ago, I thought that opening action scene, capped by the most outrageous stunt I had seen to that point in film - Bond falling off a cliff and catching up in mid-flight to a falling airplane, landing in the cockpit and righting the plane - was, of course, ridiculous but great fun to watch.\n\nThe rest of the film is more typical Bond silliness with far less spectacular scenes. When it comes to gadgets, sexual innuendos, unrealistic action with Bond escaping from impossible situations, lots of pretty women and exotic scenery to ogle, these James Bond films always give plenty of the above. Sad to say, in this film, the dialog is much dumber than usual and the fake Russian accents are hard to decipher which is very annoying.\n\nOne good point: there is almost no profanity in this film, even minor stuff....but overall, it\u0027s just a \"fair\" Bond flick. decent but nothing to write home about, except to note that it was Pierce Brosnan\u0027s debut as Bond and he is fine in that role.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
