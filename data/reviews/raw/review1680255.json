They also made it engaging while at the same time teaching a lesson about humans and nature living in harmony. People who don\u0027t like the Anime genre, will still find this a worthwhile movie to watch. I think this film can appeal to children and adults since it holds elements for both.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
