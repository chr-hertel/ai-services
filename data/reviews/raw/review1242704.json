It was a surreal event watching King Kong in awe, knowing that any other movie that would try to be the next \"King Kong\" was going to fail miserably. The film was able to let you forget that the creatures in the film were computer generated and the way that Jackson was able to put you in the environment of the film was very intense. I felt like I was on the island the whole time! It is a must see movie and definitely worth your time and money! However I do think that the casting of Jack Black might have been a little off, although I can\u0027t think of anyone better. Naomi Watts did a great job along with Adrian Brody. I\u0027m embarrass to say that I have never seen the original \"King Kong\" but it did seem like it stuck to the story line pretty well and kept all the memorable scenes. It was three hours long but it really didn\u0027t feel like three hours long the first time watching the film. There was some scenes that I could\u0027ve sworn were ripped out of \"Jurassic Park\" but I\u0027ll pretend I didn\u0027t see it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
