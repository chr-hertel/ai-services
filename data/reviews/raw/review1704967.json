They know they are not safe in their home in Russia and in Germany, take a boat trip to America. On the way, something rather unfortunate happens to little FievelÂ…\n\nMy thoughts: Don Bluth has triumphed many a time for the public, but I think this is my favourite film animated by him, apart from \"All Dogs Go To Heaven\" which appeared later. He made non-Disney animation proud of itself, as beforehand I think Disney was better and more popular than any other cartoon film company until \"The Secret Of Nimh\" came along, also directed by Don Bluth (actually I think he did two short films which weren\u0027t Disney before that including one I like called \"Banjo The Woodpile Cat\" but they weren\u0027t true motion picture films). I love his animation and style and I love most of the films he has helped with very much! :-)\n\nAbout the film, I love the way it warms your heart with the storyline, the cute and sometimes crafty characters and the lovely animation. It is also emotional. It makes you feel happy, but not depressed and it makes you happy, but not delirious. I like that. It it balances happiness, sadness, anger and fear without creating too much of any one of them. \n\nI wonder what inspired Steven Spielberg to make this film, it isn\u0027t based on a book, yet it\u0027s SO good! \n\nRecommended to: People who like mice, cute animated films, films with a balanced amount of emotions and films where everything isn\u0027t completely obvious! Enjoy! :-)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
