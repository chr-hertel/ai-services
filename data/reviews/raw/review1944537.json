Armoured car guard Slater and his partner find themselves in dangerous waters when a gang of thieves, led by Freeman, set about to steal the money. They kill Slater\u0027s partner and now he\u0027s on the run with the money in a town that\u0027s that\u0027s about to be completely flooded.\n\nA pedestrian script and cardboard characters nearly sink this one. There\u0027s no real story here to speak of, just one chase after another and the excellent cast can\u0027t do much with these clich√©d ridden and uninteresting characters.\n\nBut spectacular production values and effects make this suspense yarn more than worth your while. The setting here is beyond amazing and extremely well done and some of the action set pieces are really great. Plus that music score is awesome.\n\nWith more interesting characters and a (much) better script (loved that Springsteen quote, though) this would have been a bona fide classic.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
