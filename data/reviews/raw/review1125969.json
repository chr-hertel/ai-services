Romero\u0027s Dawn of the Dead has justifiably earned it\u0027s place as a premium horror movie, the best about Zombies (perhaps narrowly matched by the terrific Dellamorte Dellamore). Much, much better than the totally overrated Night of the Living Dead, Dawn is that rare piece of horror film that is socially conscious as well as delivering it\u0027s fair share of thrills and gore.\n\nSetting the film in a mall and attacking consumerism is a nice touch. The recently dead come to the place they identify themselves with the most, and hordes and hordes of people fill the mall. It\u0027s very funny, but also feels right on the mark. I bet I\u0027d even go to the mall, hate to admit it.\n\nRomero builds the film well. It\u0027s slow moving but never longwinded. He gradually builds tension and actually makes time for the characters to register properly. It\u0027s also nice to see them behave in a mostly logical manner, not the stupid way most one-dimensional characters have that viewers have been blessed with in too many horror movies to count.\n\nI recently bought the Ultimate Anchor Bay DVD set, which has no less than 3 editions of the film. The original theatrical version is the one I think most people are passing judgement on and my review is based on that edition. I simply like it when characters are given space to grow on viewers and it has the right amount of gore and action, and it\u0027s pretty funny as well. That said, the version I probably will watch the most in coming years is the Dario Argento edit. It moves faster, it cuts down the humour and it has a much better music score. Romero\u0027s library cues are no match for the bombastic score by Goblin, and had Romero\u0027s version used Argento\u0027s music score, it would have been even better. Argento\u0027s edit is more enjoyable, though basically Romero\u0027s edit is the better one.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
