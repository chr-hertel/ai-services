The \"action\" is weak if not say not existent in this movie. The \"acting\" is absolutely ridiculous. I bought the German DVD for 5 .\n\nOne has to be really angry to have paid for this piece of.... It is not even that funny if you\u0027re just going to watch it to have a good time with a trash masterpiece even though the German dubbed version is quite funny as the voices sound like in an old porn flick.\n\nBUT...there\u0027s gotta be a but. Otherwise I would have given only 1/10.\n\nThe cover of this movie is about the best one I have ever seen. Just watch the front cover. Brilliant! The back cover however is what really (and I\u0027m not joking!) makes this movie worth buying - even for 10 ! There are rarely any movies which made me have such a good time as the text on the back cover did. I cannot possibly translate this into English without loosing some its fun.\n\nI heard about empty covers and packages which are sold on ebay sometimes. In this case you Won\u0027t get fooled. The cover\u0027s all you need!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
