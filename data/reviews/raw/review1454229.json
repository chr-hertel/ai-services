The show is about the supposed American Dream in our society. They all succeed but look at the price. Season #1 is about Man\u0027s struggle with his Mother. Season #2 is about Man\u0027s struggle with his siblings. Season #3 is about Man\u0027s struggle with his kids. Season #5 is about Man\u0027s struggle with his friends. AND finally Season #6 is about Man\u0027s struggle with Money and Society. If you watch every episode of each season, every scene of every episode is about the THEME of each season. Season #6 is the best of them all. It\u0027s shot from a very voyeuristic level. Each character losses something very valuable to them. BUT they each choose to STAY IN THE LIFE and keep on doing what they love. The great addiction for these people. THE LIFE is like heroine for them. Tony is trying to struggle from the addiction. But he\u0027s good at what he does. This is a man who doesn\u0027t fear life. He faces everything head on in his conscious mind. That is why the center of the show is his relationship with Melfi.\n\nSo much happens in the last episode of Season #6. It tells you so much. This is a very abstract show. Everything is very subtle and there is no melodrama at all. Watch again season 6. This show is brilliant. I\u0027m shocked how good it is. If only every film or TV show was like this.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
