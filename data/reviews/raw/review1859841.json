I rent a decent amount of movies and almost always feel annoyed at wasting a couple hours after they\u0027re done, this one you won\u0027t be wasting your time on, very good, a true, honest representation of how things can easily go wrong in a person\u0027s life, and a great job by Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing a damaged individual trying to put his life back together. Jeff Daniels is enteraining as the blind friend, Isla Fisher is easy on the eyes, and the villains are all human beings as well as evil characters. The ending wraps up a little too neatly, but otherwise a truly excellent little film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
