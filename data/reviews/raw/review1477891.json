It had tremendous possibilities, but alas, never quite achieved liftoff, due to the entanglements of dialog-driven plot and the insistence on panting close-up shots.\n\nBy itself, this combination of stagy, two-dimensional filming and hard-breathing acting is nugatory, obsolete. But perhaps it\u0027s worth a look to appreciate the alto-voiced vamp, the model for Bancroft\u0027s Anna Bronski in \"To Be or Not To Be\" and Kahn\u0027s Lili von Shtupp from \"Blazing Saddles\".", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
