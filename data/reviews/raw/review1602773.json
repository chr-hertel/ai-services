Great writing and acting. Should be developed as a series. Like the best American comedy. wasted on daytime. more. HannaH waterman was very very sad and funny and the other cast were great . It was pacey. It was moving . It was funny funny. Let\u0027s hope they do more of these next year. Hope these plays are released on DVD. well done. Hannah waterman should be given her own series soon. The direction was fast, clever and colourful. Kate isset was brilliant in Coupliung and her comic talents were truly on display here. It was great to see jack Deam from the brilliant Shameless playing the nice guy who can\u0027t get love. The little cameos were spot on also", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
