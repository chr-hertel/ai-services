Watch it till end! You won\u0027t regret.\n\nMovie is certainly far from perfection - budget definitely was scarce, at the same time all male characters are rather well played, female roles are less impressive, though not bad. Some did call this movie erotic, may be formally correct, but sex is shown in more innocent, one could have expect from erotic thriller. Still, the best in this movie I found - a screenplay.\n\nThe very often used moral in most of US thrillers - DO NOT GET A STRANGER IN HOUSE! If you do, you\u0027re wrong!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
