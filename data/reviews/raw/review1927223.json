I\u0027ve seen a few documentaries that follow around a band and try to capture something worthy of a feature-length documentary(radiohead\u0027s documentary \u0027meeting people is easy\u0027 for one example) and I\u0027m always disappointed at how little band access they seem to have. This time, I didn\u0027t have that feeling at all. I think that Jeff Tweedy and the rest of wilco were really open and let us into their world. The story is told in such a way that you don\u0027t even realize that there is a story for the first thirty minutes or so. I like that. I don\u0027t think the story of wilco\u0027s best album could have been told any other way. If you hate the record industry, if you love great music, if you like a documentary filmmaker who knows how to keep his subject and not himself as the focus of his film (Michael Moore take note!) Then this is the film for you. It feature some amazing wilco concert footage that will make you fall in love with the band if you aren\u0027t already!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
