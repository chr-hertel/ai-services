A wonderful ride, and brings up some intriguing ethical issues in the development of some technologies. Obviously not meant as an educational experience. Walken is a wonderful actor and you as the viewer share his desperation, right up until the amazing climax. Some of the technology is very dated (tapes for data storage!), but hey, this was the early 80\u0027s. I think they did a cool job despite challenges. The acting as a whole was very well done, especially Natalie Wood.\n\nAn interesting commentary on the basis of human consciousness and existence.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
