It still looks good, very good. I don\u0027t know if this kind of artwork was ever duplicated so the film is worth owning for that alone.\n\nThe story is as simple: a deer\u0027s life, from birth to experiencing life in the forest and then having a fawn of his own. He has two cute friends: \"Thumper\" the rabbit and \"Flower,\" the squirrel. Liberal critics all love this film because it had a strong anti-hunting message Even though they are never shown, the hunters kill the nice animals and set fire to the forest! However, to be fair, they don\u0027t dwell on this. Overall, it\u0027s a positive film with the usual happy ending.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
