This movie fitted the Bill perfectly \u0026 I came to appreciate his commentary \u0026 enthusiasm for this movie that emerged all the more as I watched it, as I was literally drawn into it, minute by minute, beyond his introductory comments, on my initial viewing many years ago.\n\nTo me, it was propelled, layer upon layer, within half an hour, into an intriguing \u0026 fascinating production! Yes, I am aware of its flaws! But it was so enticing  the young man of idealism learning from \u0026 inspired by his father  the peasant treated like rubbish in his suffering  the opportunistic friend however flawed but nonetheless loved by his friend, the central character Sinute  and to be sure, a flawed hero too, like so many across humanity of all societies \u0026 across all timebut lovable \u0026 worthy of love too! Yes, I believe in a Christian God, but too, I acknowledge the rights \u0026 respect that should be due ANY human being of good heart, who would not or will not disrespect the rights of his fellowman without just cause. As such, I endorse this film \u0026 its presentation of a man of good heart \u0026 conviction in his belief in the sun-god he was devoted to. Such people will always be welcome in my world vision, and hopefully, in many more beyond.\n\nSo too, the drama in the ensuing movie I have watched often as surely as it has touched my heart \u0026 soul, as surely as it seems to have infuriated critics in its era. It is captivating, watching the struggles \u0026 grief \u0026 loves of Sinute, the physician! When I watch it again, I am always reminded of my friend in heart Bill, the film critic, who dared to oppose ALL the critics long ago who rubbished it. He added criticism of too many critics  that they make statues to honour stars, on the screen or in history, but they do not make statues to honour critics! And beyond all this, I am reminded with each viewing of a SUPERB \u0026 TOUCHING spectacle, of a beautiful \u0026 well-presented drama, that was not just relevant to the 1950s or some bygone era. It was meant for YOU \u0026 ME, across time \u0026 place, to every man \u0026 woman \u0026 child \u0026 to their personal aspirations for love \u0026 freedom \u0026 overcoming obstacles to misunderstanding \u0026 gross injustice \u0026 tragedy appealing to those of simple faith of many religions, that it seems too many regard as cause for war! Take a night off from invitations or unjust violence, from bigotry \u0026 judgemental attacks on others injustly executed \u0026 consider the merits of this offering. Not to the sun god, or to power that proves time \u0026 again to be so transcient .. let this OUTSTANDING movie wash over you, like waves onto a beach, like the passing hands of time  like life was meant to be. And maybe, you will find yourself carried into its world of possibilities! Lost offerings no more! 9.9 out of 10!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
