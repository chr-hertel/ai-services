I\u0027m coming down very heavily on the \"sci-fi classic\" side of the argument, indeed I think it\u0027s better than Close Encounters. It\u0027s one of those films where you come out of the theatre and want to get straight back in again, like a filmic roller coaster.\n\nI just DO NOT UNDERSTAND how people can come out of the theatre saying bad things about it. No plot?!!! You have got to be kidding! I wonder what these people actually want from their movies.\n\nTom Cruise\u0027s acting is the best it\u0027s ever been and the two young co-stars are both outstanding. The effects are awesome except for one early scene which really does look like a two-foot high model from a B-movie. The tension is maintained throughout and - rare for Spielberg - there\u0027s not too much mush. One of our national papers in Britain has called it the best sci-fi of all time. It\u0027s got to be close. (Unless you call \u0027Contact\u0027 a sci-fi - that would win hands down.) What is wrong with you 1 out of 10 ers?!!!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
