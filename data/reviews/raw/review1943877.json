Now ... who\u0027s YOUR daddy?", "reviewBody": "What to do when you\u0027re a happily married man but your beloved wife is out of town on the night of your fortieth birthday, yet two sexy young girls show up at your doorstep, literally throw themselves at you and invite you for a threesome in your own sauna? You kick them right back out on the street, of course! That\u0027ll teach them to interfere with a perfectly happy family! Well, that is what you should do in order to prevent guaranteed catastrophes to happen the next morning, but admittedly very few male individuals are likely to respond like this. Neither does the handsome George Manning in \"Death Game\", so he\u0027s stuck up with two obtrusive chicks in his house. Their behavior gets more psychotic with each hour that passes, until they even set up a fake trial against poor tied up George. \"Death Game\" is not a very good movie, but that\u0027s merely because there was too little money available for the execution and because Peter S. Traynor has no clue how to direct a suspense movie. The basic premise is quite unusual for a 70\u0027s exploitation movie (usually slavering hillbillies terrorize poor young girls instead of vice versa) and the whole concept is actually very much ahead of its time! Especially nowadays, the horror genre brings forward a lot of movies revolving on brutal home-invasions. People are subjected to fear and torture in their own houses and it\u0027s a very popular and money-making concept at the moment, like for example in \"Funny Games\" and \"The Strangers\", but this crazed little movie already did something similar in the 70\u0027s! The 40 first minutes of \"Death Game\" provide silly entertainment (Sondra Loncke at the breakfast table) and irresistible trashy goodness (that soundtrack!!), but unfortunately the second half of the film is incomprehensibly boring and unexciting. It shouldn\u0027t be, since the girls get more deranged and all, but it suddenly feels as if the writers\u0027 inspiration had vanished and only padding remained. There are still two fantastic highlights to experience near the end, though! One involves a pussycat (did you know glass windows aren\u0027t cat-proof?) and the other is a stupendously laugh-out-loud hysterical ending. Even a threesome wouldn\u0027t have such a fantastic climax! Now if you\u0027ll excuse me, I\u0027m going to search for that awesomely catchy \"Good Old Daddy\" theme song on YouTube!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
