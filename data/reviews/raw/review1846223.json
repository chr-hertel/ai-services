The title is apt, as its focus is less on the evil itself or the process of combating it, and more on the damage it does to those who touch and are touched by it. The protagonists grow harder, more detached, more despairing, and more absorbed by the horrors their occupation revolves around, and the grief of the victims is almost palpable.\n\nIf it suffers from the occasional bout of unrealism, I didn\u0027t notice. I was too absorbed by the atmosphere and the pathos. It\u0027s superbly done and well worth watching. The acting is stupendous, the characters intriguing, and the production brilliant. It\u0027s one of the finest crime dramas I\u0027ve ever seen.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
