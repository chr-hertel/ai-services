IMDb ratings are not perfect at all , no wonder movies like this make to 8.4 and many good movies which are not much popular makes in to 3 or 4 points there are so many classic comedy movies of old times which are much below rated here, this movie doesn\u0027t really deserve a rating above 4,i am thankfull that i didn\u0027t buy a original DVD of this movie,don\u0027t waste ur money on this", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
