Albert went crazy because of the morphine. But it was interesting and exciting. I was so shocked on how hard it is to spend one night without drugs. You see, i think more teenagers should watch that episode because it was like what drug addicts really go through. That morphine really screwed up that part of his life. And when he got violent i was like \"Wow...\" I really enjoyed watching this episode and i would watch it over and over again until i got tired of it or something like that. But overall, i think that Albert\u0027s character did an excellent performance. One of the best i\u0027ve seen.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
