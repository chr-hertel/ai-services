Women who cannot say enough good about the minister read her palm and tell her she\u0027ll meet a new man. She\u0027s led forward to \"surrender her life to Jesus-ah!\" She has some concern for her son, something that\u0027s a feature in the other short by this director, Judgement., which is also featured on the DVD for Psychopathia Sexualis.\n\nThe ending of this one is rather obscure to me. Maybe I missed something, or maybe it\u0027s up to interpretation.\n\nShot on digital, the scenes inside the church are filmed somewhat diffusely, lending a different quality to them than the outdoor shots." }
