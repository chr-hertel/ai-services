I was so shocked to see a fellow human rate this 10/10. Even a as a pure revenge film this sucks, big time.\n\nFurthermore,The Punisher franchise has been wasted, The Punisher is supposed to be a dark, tortured, anti- hero of titanic proportions, power drilling peoples heads and sawing of their hands etc. The \u0027actor\u0027 whose name I won\u0027t mention, does a truly pathetic job of putting this across. There\u0027s no overall menace to any of the films \u0027charachters\u0027 bar, maybe John Travaltas.\n\nThe script itself was terrible, the style of the whole film was bland and utterly forgettable, this reminds me of an early \u002790\u0027s straight to video release and it\u0027s only possible use, would be to film students wanting to observe \u0027how most certainly not to do it\u0027. As for the comment from another member stating \u0027one of the best films of 2004\u0027, dear me, you sir/maddam are a total and utter, and lets not make a mistake I feel bad for you, a total gimp, this really is one of the worst films of all time,it might have got a 5 back in the day of Rambo but compared to Sin City and The Island this is utter crap.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
