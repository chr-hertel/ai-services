Nice change from the shoot-em-up gangster movies most black people are in", "reviewBody": "First off, to everyone one who said the swimming details were not correct i don\u0027t think it really matters. I\u0027m not a professional swimmer nor do I know the rules, so the accuracy was irelevent for me. I loved the actors. I believed them and i got goosebumps many times throughout the movie. This is a flick you can watch with the kids and grandparents and has a great lesson. I really cared about each and every character in the movie! The soundtrack also made me dance in my chair. Each song was perfectly picked and fit the movie wonderfully. Bernie Mac was hilarious as always. Terrence Howard gave a strong and believable performance. Evan Ross (who also was in ATL, another great movie http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0466856/) shows great promise as a young actor. What more can i say rent it, watch it and recommend it!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
