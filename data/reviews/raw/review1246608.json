The city\u0027s landscape has been divided by massive walls that isolate so-called dangerous ghetto areas, protecting the city\u0027s elite from the disenfranchised. Vice rules in these walled-in communities and law enforcement only exists at the barrier\u0027s checkpoints.\u0027 This is no \u0027relationship\u0027 film! A very well made, effective French Action Film. They go the \u0027Real stuntmen, no wires\u0027 route to great effect. I like the soundtrack, the plot moves along a quick pace, and an effective cast. The first 40 minutes is used to introduce the two main subjects: \"Cyril Raffaelli\" and \"David Belle\". Think of them as two smaller versions of \"Tony Jaa\". Not quite as skilled as he, but still great in their own right.\n\nLook, this is a well made, nicely edited low budget action film. Expect nothing more.\n\nOne of the French actors, \"Cyril Raffaelli\" was there for intro and Q/A. He spoke through an interpreter and explained that there was no one injured during the production (other than him breaking an ankle on a very simple stunt). The more difficult time for the actors was during rehearsal, while working out all the choreography. Some of the film was shot in Romania. They approached the French government asking for permission to perform the \u0027parkour\u0027 stunt work on the roof tops of Paris. They refused. The Romanian government did not seem to have a problem with them running and jumping across the top of the city.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
