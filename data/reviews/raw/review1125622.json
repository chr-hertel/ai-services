Michael Curtiz directs with his usual flair and the Epsteins, Julius and Philip, wrote the screen play, which is based on a novel by Fanny Hurst.\n\nWe are taken to the Lemp household. It\u0027s a happy home of some extraordinary musicians and educators, led by the patriarch Adam Lemp, who has the good fortune of having Aunt Etta overseeing everything. At the beginning, we see the four Lemp sisters as they go to accompany Emma to the doctor. It\u0027s expected she is pregnant, but no, the big surprise is that Ann is, but the problem is that Mickey Borden, the father, has died recently. Ann has been seeing Felix, a kind man who, as a conductor, was associated to Burden. What to do?\n\nWell, the comedy is a delight. We see all the four Lemp sisters supporting one another in their difficult times. Emma can\u0027t conceive and they all rally to her side. Thea and Ben decide to adopt. Kay falls in love with the young Dr. Forrest and finally Ann has the baby prematurely. By the magic of the movies, we get to see the little angel who, surprise, surprise, appears to have conquered the problems she had at birth thanks to the transfusion of Felix\u0027s blood and in a matter of days looks as though she was carried full term!\n\nBut, never mind, this comedy will charm anyone because the amazing performances Mr. Curtiz got out of the cast. Best of all, Priscilla Lane, who is absolutely marvelous in the film. Rosemary Lane is perfect as Kay, the girl in love with the doctor. Lola Lane, as Thea is good and Gale Page is the fourth Lemp sister, Emma. Claude Rains doesn\u0027t have much to do. Eddie Albert as the young doctor is fine, but best of all is Jeffrey Lynn, who as Felix makes it clear he is the man for Ann. May Robson also is fun as Aunt Etta. Frank McHugh and Dick Foran complete the quartet of husbands. John Garfield is seen briefly in a dream-like sequence.\n\n\"Four Wives\" will warm anyone\u0027s heart.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
