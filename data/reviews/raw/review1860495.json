A desire for more thought provoking facts could have helped validate the hero\u0027s desire.\n\nOverall acting felt tense and awkward which made the craft more noticeable and made it difficult to let go of the actor\u0027s fame.\n\nIt\u0027s a unique film in it\u0027s story and arguably would have been better in a more independent circuit or with less known actors. An overall style or unique artifact was desired and severely missed.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
