It is so rubbish that I was prepared to kill myself. Luckily I didn\u0027t do that. Otherwise I wouldn\u0027t be here to write this. Some people may like it but the writers and crew have mucked up so much. They mixed up Shakespeare and Modern times. If they were clever they would have chosen one or the other. They also left electric lights on the Christmas tree. I\u0027m ashamed. Ashamed. I recommend you do not watch it. I was forced to but don\u0027t watch it, unless being forced to. Though i did like Feste. He was acted very well. Unfortunately, it was the only thing good about this film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
