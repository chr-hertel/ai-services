I don\u0027t mind that technique, Nichols has filmed many a play and he is so very good at it. Any problem the film may have is likely a reflection of the play itself. I\u0027m guessing that Mike Nichols did more with this play than any other stage director could. I happen to really like plays about relationships between men and women, but I had the sense that the dialog was a bit too influenced by David Mamet. While the play\u0027s ideas and narrative were fine and thoughtful, I think it would have been a better play if it wasn\u0027t so derivative of Mamet. Only Mamet should do Mamet, and this playwright would have been better off using his own voice. \"Closer\" is an example of how a great director and great performances can elevate a play that is good enough, but maybe not as good as these players\u0027 skill at interpreting it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
