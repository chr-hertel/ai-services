At the beginning he is this sweet innocent young boy who has no clue what life is about. However, after his sister becomes ill, he must grow responsible and trust the local \"Businessman\" who will help him. He is no longer protected by his grandmother and is at the mercy of the boss. He later finds out that he has been lied to by the boss and that there is no help for his ill sister. Through out the film, director Kusturica shows how this once innocent boy is corrupted by the people surrounding him and how he becomes evil person. Many of the moments in the film will make you think; \"why is it that someone like that be corrupted?; how is it that there are people who can just watch what is happening and do nothing?\" I was deeply moved by how this kid became corrupted. It\u0027s interesting to see how this boy acts when he has the power and makes you think that not many people would act any different. You can see how the environment influences people. It\u0027s not disappointing though. Many things can be learned.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
