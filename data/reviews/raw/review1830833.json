A group of soldiers is sent to the hospital to eliminate the infected staff and interns but private DeLuca (Michael Moon) steals a test tube with the virus and hide it inside a vacuum flask. He is transformed in a zombie and killed but the vacuum flask falls in the grass. In the present days, a group of patients in the mental institution Ravenside Memorial Hospital finds the vacuum flask and later when one of them opens the vessel, the culture tube drops on the floor of a bathroom contaminating the group and their Dr. Donwynn (Stephan Wolfert). Along the days, the disease spreads and becomes an uncontrollable outbreak of hunger for human flesh.\n\nThe biggest mistake of the trash \"Day of the Dead 2: Contagium\" is the plagiarization of the name of the famous \"Day of the Dead\" from the trilogy of the great director George Romero, who revitalized and promoted in 1968 the genre of zombies used in 1964 in the cult \"The Last Man on Earth\" with \"Night of the Living Dead\", in a sort of prequel of the classic film of Vincent Price. \"Day of the Dead 2: Contagium\" is silly, has flaws, \"drinks in the fountain\" of Romero\u0027s trilogy, but it is not as bad as indicated in IMDb Rating and many reviews. The acting and the special effects are reasonable for a low-budget movie, it is extremely gore and nasty, but I believe it should have had more dark humor, like in Peter Jackson\u0027s \"Braindead\". In the end, I found \"Day of the Dead 2: Contagium\" a reasonable entertainment. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Dia dos Mortos 2: Contágio\" (\"Day of the Dead 2: Contagium\")", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
