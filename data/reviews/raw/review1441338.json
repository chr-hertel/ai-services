The story makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The acting borderline\u0027s a Showtime porno, and the monster(s) look like Smeagol hooked on household cleaning products. The movie relies on sudden loud noises to actually get any reaction from an audience.\n\nThe trailer is actually better than the film! ONE monster would have been enough to take this in the right direction... but NOoOoOo... they had to have a ton of them. It\u0027s just your average \u0027look at boobs covered in blood\u0027 horror flick that does little to advance the genre.\n\nStay away from this movie at all costs please!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
