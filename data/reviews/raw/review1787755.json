The movie is basically all about the lives of American suburbanites but put in a very realistic way. This is a great psychology movie because it shows a large amount of information on developmental processes. The acting and the dialogue in the movie are of course the best part. The movie is primarily based on Kevin Spacey\u0027s role which he captures and absolutely stunned me when seeing him. Wes Bently was also very good. It\u0027s his script that really moved me and made me think hard about life after hearing some things he said. It\u0027s truly a wonderfully well made movie. A good drama and good thing to watch for those of you studying psych in school.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
