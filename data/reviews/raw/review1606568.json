I thought Kevin Bacon, Djimon and Queen Latifah did an OK job. THe plot was weak. ANd Keyshia Knight-Pulliam should have stopped acting after being Rudy from the Cosby Show. Her acting was so bad that it was funny. Alfre Woodard was HORRIBLE with a Capital \"H\"! Her hairstyles and outfits alone were enough to make you stop the movie. Golden Brooks did the same as she always does in EVERY movie that she plays and she was normal.. Not good but NORMAL! On a scale from 1 to 10 I give it a 3! One point for Kevin Bacon, 1 point for Djimon and the last point for Queen Latifah! It was corny and cheesy and it seems like they were trying to stay within a budget. Alicia Silverstone was funny.. but again, not good but funny!" }
