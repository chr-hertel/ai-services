You\u0027d be wrong.\n\n\"Lucky You\" stars Eric Bana as Huck Cheever (another dumb character name), a down and out poker player who always just goes too far with his bets. Huck lives in the shadow of his father, LC Cheever (Robert Duvall-showing up the rest of the cast), a champion poker player. One night while out at the casinos, Huck comes across Billie Offer (an even worse name, played by Drew Barrymore),who intrigues him. They soon go out on a date and Huck treats her to watching him play poker with her money. She has a great night and they spend the night together. It looks like these two will start a nice little journey together, until Huck steals some money from her. She finds out and is livid and decides to end their brief courtship. Huck keeps bouncing around the casinos, trying to get an entry into the World Championship. After several failures and discouragements, Huck ends up getting a backer and gets his dream.\n\nWill Huck win the Championship? Will he sort out the issues for his father? Will Billie decide she was a bit harsh on Huck and give him another chance?\n\nI won\u0027t answer these questions, for you, but I\u0027ll share the following....\n\n-Eric Bana was not convincing at all as a poker player. Not sure if it was a bad script or he was just mailing it in, but he was pretty average. -The poker stuff was pretty lousy, especially Huck\u0027s speech about how poker is so pure because when you get to a table you\u0027re all even. Um, no you\u0027re not. Some are better at it, some have massive gambling problems and some are major hustlers. -Drew was pretty poor too. She wasn\u0027t given much to work with...actually her character had no depth and shouldn\u0027t have even ended up in the movie. The relationship had about 20min screen time I think and wasn\u0027t key to the movie.\n\nSummary: you won\u0027t feel \"lucky\" that you spent $3.95 on this at the end of the movie", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
