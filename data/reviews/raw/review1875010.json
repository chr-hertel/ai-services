There really is no need to speak about plot, as this movie makes as much sense as, well, blind watching a TV. There\u0027s nothing in the film that could be describer as logic or sense in the story; it just happens and you are amazed of the lack of intelligence.\n\nIf you can name a clich√©, the changes are that Cobra has it. There\u0027s bad blood between cops, traitors and nonsense murderers. There even is silly sidekick, and \"clever\" throws. And it all is crowned with a classic 80\u0027s soundtrack of the hottest bands of the hour. And yet I couldn\u0027t care less.\n\nThe bottom line is, Cobra is garbage. Idiotic piece of trash action directed in the midst of the 80\u0027s. A movie that would have been better left undone.\n\nScore: 2/10. The film is just too illogical and the actors do very bad job, but really, no one could lift the script into any level of adequacy.\n\nCamp value: 7/10. The ending speech by the Nightslaher alone is such a camp moment, that if it doesn\u0027t make you laugh nothing will.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
