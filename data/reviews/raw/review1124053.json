These two factors made watching \"American Dad\" even harder. \n\nFrom most of the reviews I have read everyone either hates \"American Dad\" for the non-original character ideas and concepts (in comparison with Family Guy) or they have a problem with the show being \"un-patriotic\". \n\nMy reasons for despising the show are neither...but while I am on the subject...The word Patriotism is having pride for one\u0027s country, and one of the great things about this country is that we have the right to question ( or in the case of \"AD\" or \"FG\" satirize) our government and its practices. In this since I respect \"American Dad\" for having the \"balls\" to do such a thing with this country in such a \"terrorist paranoia overly patriotic conservative right wing\" state.\n\nNo my reason\u0027s for not liking the show are simply that the jokes aren\u0027t funny. As for the comparison between \"AD\" and \"FG\" similarities between works of the same artists are all to common and should be expected...What annoys me about the similarities is that they try to pass off the same character layouts with slight differences, and assume that we will take these characters for a brand new original show. All in all American Dad is a Diluted Family Guy. User Rating 3/10!" }
