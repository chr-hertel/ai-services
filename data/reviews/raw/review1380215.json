It has one of the best producers and distributors backing it (Yash Raj Films). Therefore there has been no paucity in presentation and the screen fills up like a colour palette. Add the good music(it grows on you slowly) and you come up with a good treat. Well that\u0027s why it was a disappointment!! At one point the storyline (not much of a story) went haywire and the ending leaves you with a feeling of being discontented. You feel as if the movie is moving in breaks and there is no continuity. I believe the director\u0027s previous movie \u0027Hum Tum\u0027 was better and sorry but I have to say \u0027Fanaa\u0027 was tad little better than his first film. Maybe he should stick to romantic movies and steer clear of saddling serious issues with romance.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
