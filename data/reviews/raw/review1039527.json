Aren\u0027t you also intrigued ? \n\nThere\u0027s two reasons for a prospective audience to watch this . One is that they\u0027re equally intrigued as I was and the second reason is that it sounds like really good masturbation fuel . If you\u0027re watching for the second reason you\u0027ll be bitterly disappointed since there\u0027s very little on screen sex but if you\u0027re watching for the sensible reason you\u0027ll still be as disappointed as the voyeurs . Ms Chong gives a pretentious neo feminist explanation of why she\u0027s doing it , something along the lines of \" I\u0027m doing this because I\u0027ll be striking a blow against chauvanism and by being in control of the situation I\u0027ll be showing that it\u0027s the men who are sluts \" . I don\u0027t think Ms Chong has thought through he reasons fully . Either that or she\u0027s not a great communicator \n\nWhat is obvious is that Annabel Chong is certainly a very unhappy individual who probably needs to use sex in order to boost her esteem in much the same way as a person with a drink problem uses alcohol to boost their self esteem . Sex and alcohol like so many things in life are metaphysical false economies for the human soul . Luckily we see towards the end of the movie the self destruction that being a porn star can bring but Ms Chong unlike the audience can\u0027t see the woods for the trees", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
