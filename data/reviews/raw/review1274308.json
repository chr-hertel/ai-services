Two men, both called Takeshi, live in Tokyo. One is a well-known actor and one is an actor-wannabe who works in a convenience store. The two Takeshis are being played by the director of the movie Takeshi Kitano. It may sound a bit like \"Being John Malcovich\" but goes far beyond that.\n\nSure, the movie isn\u0027t for everyone but it\u0027s definitely interesting and at parts very visual and imaginative. It\u0027s without any doubt the most extreme Meta-movie I ever seen. \n\nWhen a movie has many layers you usually describe it as a \"deep\" movie. Takeshis has an enormous amount of layers but most of them are paper thin, if not shallow. In the beginning you try to keep track of whether you\u0027re watching a dream or one of the two Takeshis reality. It turns out to be a futile task, especially after one caterpillar-scene too many (You\u0027ll know it when you see it). \n\nDo remember that this is not \"Memento\". It\u0027s not really meant to make sense. OK, I\u0027ve always been allergic to the popular urge to over-explain everything in movies but Takeshis might be a bit too far in the other extreme. A heady cocktail of randomness and logical short circuits but not more than most people experience under a good nights sleep, which is what this movie is all about. Dreams and dreams within dreams. \n\nPlease, watch Takeshis with an open mind. You either regard it as an aged directors milestone after a long and creative odyssey of ups and downs, much like Fellinis \"8 Â½\", or you can look at it as an overstressed actors brain fart after too many crazy TV-shows and gangster movies. \n\nIt\u0027s a bumpy ride, it may be a bit too long, weird and garish but you might have a few laughs and at least you have something to talk about afterward. A bit like a theme-park then, isn\u0027t it?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
