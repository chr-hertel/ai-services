Especially, the scene of the brutal, horrific, terrible murder in the gay club was unbelievable. I haven\u0027t seen such a scene on a movie. Logically, this movie should not be allowed to people under the age of 18...Nothing more than sex, drugs and extreme violence. I can\u0027t understand how the director put such a brutal and nasty scene(death in gay club) on the movie...it was a real shock for me. The only good of the movie was..Monica Bellucci who is really beautiful...However, the whole film(classical French crap) is about rapes, sexual language and brutality.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
