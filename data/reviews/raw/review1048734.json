This movie was great. One of a few thrillers from Bollywood. Sushmita Sen, and Arjun Rampal gave a breath taking performance. Amitabh was great as usual. The plot line of this movie was good, and it keeps your attention with twists and turns along the way. By the way, for the guy that asked, Aankhen means blind. Before you rent, or buy a Bollywood movie, you have to be ready to listen, to a lot of song, and watch a lot of dances. Indians who have a rough life, like to watch movies with a lot of songs to up lift their spirits. If you like bollywood movies, this one is very very good. It is a must see! With a 9 out of ten on MY personal scale", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
