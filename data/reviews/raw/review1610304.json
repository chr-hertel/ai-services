In his first appearance, he was nothing like that; quite the opposite, he was a bad-ass. In \"A Tale of Two Kitties\", wandering felines Babbit and Catstello (spoofing Abbott and Costello) find a bird\u0027s nest. Grouchy, straight-talking Babbit sends the nervous Catstello up to get the bird, only the tiny avian - whose name isn\u0027t actually identified - proves to be the nastiest mother ever. There\u0027s naturally an anvil gag.\n\nIt\u0027s just great to see how the guys behind the Looney Tunes weren\u0027t afraid to show anything that they wanted. Definitely one to see.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
