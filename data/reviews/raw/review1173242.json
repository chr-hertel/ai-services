It is definitely my favorite movie of all time. It\u0027s one of those films that could not be pulled off by any other actor.... only Bill Murray could fit this role as Phil Conners, and he fits it perfectly. The incredible extent of his whimsical acting in this film is 80% of what makes it one of the greatest films I have ever seen... the other 20% belonging to the great storyline and supporting characters.\n\nThis movie can be viewed at any time and still liked. It is a peaceful movie, if you are in relaxed spirits. It is especially great for those nights when you just got home from work or school and the day didn\u0027t go as you wanted it to, and you feel though as if life is struggle to no end. This movie is about second chances, and outside of the incredible humor, can be inspiring to get every day of your life right, and to remember the things that are most important in life.\n\nWatch it, and see what you think!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
