I assume that is what is under this heading here at IMDb. Perhaps they broke it up into two parts on television but both parts are on one disc, and labeled only as one episode on the back on the DVD.\n\nAnyway, after the D-Day coverage, they went back to what was happening in the Pacific, and we learn about the Miarianas Islands and other advances against Japan. Those islands included Guam, Tinian and Saipan. At the latter, the biggest aircraft carrier battle ever was fought. There is some super action footage in here. \n\nThe battle for Saipan went on for four weeks and cost the U.S. about 25,000 men in casualties, either killed, wounded or reported missing. To date, it was the costliest battle in the Pacific. The Japanese lost even more. An interesting observation made here by several soldiers: the Japanese fighters, with the possible exception of U.S. Marines, were the toughest fighters in the war, ones that would never surrender but fight to the death no matter what.\n\nAll in all, another excellent episode.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
