I suppose that he is best recalled for his handling one of the recurring lead roles on THE NAME OF THE GAME with Gene Barry and Robert Stack. But he is equally good in comedy as well as drama, and in 1964 he made this series, VALENTINE\u0027S DAY, about a publishing executive in New York City, who has misadventures due to his family, friends, and himself (due to his many girlfriends). But above all his valet and confidant, Rocky Sin, causes many problems. Rocky is always looking for a fast buck, and frequently drags Valentine into schemes he has little interest in.\n\nMost of this sounds like hundreds of preposterous television sit-coms of the 1950s through the 1970s. This was the type of artificial stuff that made Newton Minnow label television \"a vast wasteland\". But if the material was handled correctly it was frequently very, very funny. On VALENTINE\u0027S DAY you had Mr. Franciosa doing his damnedest to bring life to the film - and doing it well. He was widely abetted by Jack Soo as Rocky Sin.\n\nSoo had made his name in Rodgers and Hammerstein\u0027s THE FLOWER-DRUM SONG, both on stage and screen. Then he appeared in other films like THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE (he is one of Bea Lillie\u0027s two minions - with Pat Morita - who at one point do an impromptu sand dance to \"Japanese Sandman\"). Here he took his superb comic skills and aided in filling out the artifice of the scripts.\n\nIt also helped that the scripts were well written for a change. In one, Valentine\u0027s mother is coming for a visit the same day that an important book reviewer is coming. Years before they had an affair, but it ended in mutual recriminations. When the mother sees her old boyfriend she says, \"It\u0027s amazing what the morticians accomplish. You\u0027d swear he\u0027s alive!\" That kind of dialog was rare in 1964 sitcoms.\n\nOne of my favorite episodes deals with Soo trying to get a restaurant started with Valentine backing it. It\u0027s an expensive proposition, and Franciosa is properly dubious about it. Franciosa and his various friends come to the restaurant, and the experience turns into a disaster. But another man who comes in is an elderly Chinese gentleman, who in looking over the menu latches onto one item. His face positively beams, and he orders (and keeps repeating the order), \"Blueberry Blintzes\". In the end the restaurant is started with the backing of the elderly Chinese gentleman, not Franciosa.\n\nDespite the chemistry of Franciosa and Soo, and the wit brought to the scripts, the show lasted only one year. Both stars went on to other work, but it was the first comedy on television for Soo, and in Rocky Sin one gets glimmers of that outstanding police officer, Detective Yamana on BARNEY MILLER." }
