If you like different kinds of music unlike the guy above then you will like the movie. It gave an atmosphere that made you not want to leave. The concerts were mostly the last song of the artists set so you felt like you were right there. My favorite set was actually prodigy and I\u0027m not even a prodigy fan. The energy that they brought was unbelievable. There were a lot of interesting interviews that show you all sides of the music industry. If your a person who goes to a festival to see one show then you would not like it, but I\u0027m buying it as soon as it comes out and I suggest you see it before you judge it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
