It is basically a mix of the Mad Max films in Scotland but also throw in some scenes from 28 Days Later, Resident Evil, LOTR and Braveheart.\n\nIf you can imagine that then you\u0027ll have a pretty good idea what to expect - no, I didn\u0027t think you could.\n\nIt does just massively rip off all the above but as I said, I\u0027m not claiming its good, just a lot of fun.\n\nAdded bonus is the great music choices which just add to the fun - \"Good Tning\" by FYC when the main lunatic introduces himself to the crowd and \"Two Tribes\" by Frankie Goes To Hollywood for the big car chase.\n\nNot gonna win an Oscar but a hell of a ride.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
