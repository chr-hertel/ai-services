This movie is devoid of either. It\u0027s as painful to watch as your aunt\u0027s home movies, and probably filmed on the same 8mm camera. When there is any dialog that is discernible (and most of it is narrative), it has no comprehendible context. The location of the filming is obviously a nice spot, but even the awful camera work fails to display it. We have no way of knowing if any of the good-looking boys in the film can act, because they have no script at all to work with, and likely little direction. If its the boys you want to see, skip the movie and download some screen captures.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
