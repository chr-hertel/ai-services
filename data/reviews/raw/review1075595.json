Some top quality, gripping scenes strung together in a loose-knit story.", "reviewBody": "A series of characters united by their involvement in a auto crash in Los Angeles are explored in the 24 hour period prior to the accident.\n\nThe movie follows this web of stories which focusing on prejudice and racism. The movie is not completely dark, some of the behavior is so bigoted that it is funny, and there are several minor acts of heroism.\n\nCrash is a series of powerful scenes among different characters in a large and talented cast. Most memorable are the troubled Sondra Bollock character confronting her husband and then coming to grips with her loneliness. Don Cheatle\u0027s character has several excellent moments.\n\nThere is an astounding scene where a young person is shot -- very gripping.\n\nWith so many good performances, the directing must be the cause. Kudos to Paul Haggis.\n\nFinally the movie makes you think about the sad condition of humanity and the briefness of life. Perhaps a little preachy, but not too much, no demerits for that.\n\nSandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Ludicrous, and many more", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
