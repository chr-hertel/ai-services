While driving to his appointment Justin swerves to avoid a rabbit in the road and his car gets stuck in a ditch that just happens to be in front of the home of Jack (Paul Bright, who also wrote and directed the film) and his loony senile father. Jack\u0027s life partner died a few years back and he is determined his plight in life is to live in solitude as caretaker for his father. Justin is invited to spend the night while his car is fixed by the local tow truck/mechanic.
