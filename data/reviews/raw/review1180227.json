Both my wife and I felt that this movie was very cleverly written, directed, and produced (I was very amused by the pop culture \u0026 modern music overlay to medieval dramatic situations, and it works very well). We\u0027ve seen lots of movies but have never seen this type of thing done this cleverly before. The acting was excellent all around. Lastly, the romantic interests were done well enough that it was very cool for both men \u0026 women movie watchers. Looking for a movie that feels good while keeping your brain from turning to mush? This is an excellent choice, and you can feel good seeing it several times over.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
