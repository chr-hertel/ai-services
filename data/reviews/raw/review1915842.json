The story centres on a young and kind-hearted girl who enters the woods with only a small basket of supplies. As the story progresses, she meets various characters who each ask her to part with one possession, which she does, safe in the knowledge that they will benefit from the object far more than she ever could. Towards the end of the story, after having given away everything but the clothes off her back, she meets a young boy, naked and shivering. The young boy asks if she could lend him her clothes, which she does, only to then reveal himself to be a young prince, who whisks the girl off to his castle to be his princess for the rest of their lives. This message, that those who are selfless and are willing to sacrifice everything, seemingly without reward, had a profound effect on von Trier, who used the basic story to flesh out his critically acclaimed 1995 film, Breaking the Waves, as well his first film made in accordance with the Dogme 95 manifesto, his masterpiece The Idiots (1998).\n\nLike those films, Dancer in the Dark focuses on a naive and somewhat childlike woman, lost in a world she doesn\u0027t understand. If we compare it to the other two films in the series, then Dancer in the Dark probably seems like the least radical; almost recalling a straight Hollywood melodrama from the 1950\u0027s, which, I suppose, explains why von Trier decided to set the film in Washington State, 1964; bringing to mind the subversive aspect of all-American hospitality that would surface again in his following film, the controversial Dogville (2003). Within this framework, von Trier touches upon the notions of immigration, corruption, manipulation and exploitation; as Selma - a tragic heroine, who only wants to do the best for her young son - is ruthlessly used and abused by both the system and the state, as well as the people that she loved.\n\nIn this respect, the film recalls the works of German filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder, who also took on the various conventions of Hollywood melodrama and filtered them through a naturally European sensibility of irony and biting bitter cynicism, to create heartbreaking tragedies like The Merchant of Four Seasons (1972), Fox and his Friends (1976) and In A Year Of 13 Moons (1978). Von Trier\u0027s film is no less heartbreaking than those of Fassbinder, as he introduces us to a morally \"good\" character; in this instance, an immigrant factory worker who lives in a trailer owned by the town\u0027s sheriff and his gold-digging wife. Right from the start, von Trier is playing with the clichés familiar from Hollywood cinema of the film\u0027s particular era (1945-1965), giving Selma a son to look after and a handicap in the form a severely worsening eye-condition. It is this element of the story that gives the film its sense of direction, as we learn that if Selma doesn\u0027t manage to raise the required amount of money for her son to have an expensive operation, he too will develop the same ocular impairment as her.\n\nAs is typical of von Trier\u0027s work, Dancer in the Dark rapidly spirals into the territory of abject misery, as characters make poor choices which inevitably leave them open to manipulation and exploitation from those around them. By the half-way point we start to get the feeling that thing\u0027s won\u0027t have a happy ending, but instead, will continue to plunge headlong into heartbreak and tragedy. It is at this point that von Trier introducing the musical element; breaking away from the muted colours and hand-held compositions of his cinéma-vérité-like plot-strands to give us a series of bold, colourful, beautifully composed musical numbers that attempt to externalise Selma\u0027s internal feelings of pain, doubt, anxiety and fear. Many will no doubt be put off by this odd combination of clichéd, soap-opera style melodrama with radical digital film-making; with von Trier\u0027s approach to the film fitting in with the style that he had been exploring since his legendary TV series The Kingdom (1994) and the aforementioned Breaking the Waves.\n\nUltimately, Dancer in the Dark wins out for its sheer emotional power. The performance from Bjork, combined with von Trier\u0027s naked direction, is entirely raw and empathetic; finding pathos and warmth in this character that could have quite easily been shown up as a generic cliché. It is heartbreaking, with the honesty (or faux honesty as many detractors might see it) creating an overwhelming sensation that is further extended to von Trier\u0027s merciless direction, with that air of forced reality and his stark, Dreyer-like close ups that accentuate every emotion; and all backed by a string of excellent performances from the ensemble cast. By the end, you\u0027ll have already made up your mind as to whether or not the film justifies this approach, or whether it is instead somehow shallow and manipulative; as many of von Trier\u0027s harshest critics might suggest. For me however, Dancer in the Dark is a rare cinematic experience that places its emphasis on the emotional connection between director and star/character and audience, continuing von Trier\u0027s development as the greatest living filmmaker (besides Godard) and leaving us with this incredibly affecting, once in a life-time experience." }
