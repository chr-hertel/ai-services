Once again, Hollywood managed to fool me into renting a useless and shallow film with limited artistic value and negligible intellectual challenge. The movie paralyzed me emotionally and intellectually, leaving me not caring about any of its characters or content. I kept waiting for it to heat up and develop into some kind of ethical or legal controversy, but to no avail. Half way through it, I found myself checking the counter on my DVD player to find out how much longer I have to endure this torturous peace of work. I never understood the significance of Capote\u0027s personal life, nor his bonding/fascination with this cold blooded killer. I didn\u0027t really care about Hoffman\u0027s performance and could care less about his skills in imitating or looking like the real Capote. For some reason, it seems that Hollywood, and the so called critics, are discovering new standards for arts. They have been building whole movies around the ability of certain actors to imitate some famous persons from the past such as Capote, Ed Murrow and others. Who cares if they can mimic the actors look and sound?!? You need a story first, not last. They are building shallow stories around actors\u0027 talents, not the other way around. Why did someone felt the need to make a film about Capote and a half century old murder!? What is the significance of such an annoying person? Just because they found someone who can imitate him! The movie did not entertain me, engage me emotionally or intellectually, or provoke me. It just bored the hell out of me.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
