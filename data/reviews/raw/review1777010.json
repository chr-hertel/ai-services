Unlike other movies you aren\u0027t told everything and watch the character react, you watch the characters react and figure things out right along with them.\n\nAnother reason why this movie is different is because it doesn\u0027t show you everything and show you surprises in the trailer, it keeps a very simple trailer that doesn\u0027t want to spoil ANYTHING for you. I also believe the purpose of the old man is to tell you that he is invisible to his friends, and tells you what is going to happen in the story without actually showing you something from the movie.\n\nI definitely think the \"Old Man\" was perfect in the trailer and he had to be there, or they would have to include the old man in the actual movie, ruin the suspense, and destroy the essence of the movie, or they could have had a 20 minute trailer showing him in the movie actually figuring it out.\n\nAs for the rest of this review, read a review where someone gave the movie 7/10 or above, they will tell you why the movie is so good.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
