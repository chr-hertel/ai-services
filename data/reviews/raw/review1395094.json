Black, totally out-of-place and seemingly oblivious to the fact that he is supposed to be a holy man, is a crazed nut who only seems to care about becoming a sports celebrity and getting together with nun Ana de la Reguera. The gags and situations are meant to be comedic revelations, but they are silly misfires and stale attempts at coherency. A really ugly dog of a picture that is going to be a strong competitor for the most ill-conceived and poorly executed mainstream film of the year. 2 stars out of 5." }
