The best way to describe the kind of movie we\u0027re dealing with here is to say that if you liked \"Life Is Beautiful\" you will like \"Cinema Paradiso.\" People who don\u0027t like foreign movies like this one because, if you take away the Italian subtitles, this film is as fake and schlocky as the worst piece of sentimental clap-trap churned out by the Hollywood myth-making machine. Not one single moment of this movie rang true for me. Subtlety was passed over on every occasion for the the most manipulative of cinematic tricks, and the love story that anchors the film is boring and completely missing any sort of sexual spark.\n\nI have a feeling that this movie is so beloved because people who in reality have pretty low-brow movie tastes can watch it and feel like they\u0027re cinematically smarter. A double feature of this and \"Life Is Beautiful\" might just be enough to make me lose hope in serious film forever.\n\nGrade: D", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
