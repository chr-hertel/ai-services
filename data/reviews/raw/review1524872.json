The surprise being that \"Shotgun\" is one of the best suspense and action thrillers I have come across. It\u0027s been a few years but I can\u0027t recall a single element of the book that was carried over into the movie including the name of the title character. Mr. Wingate I hope got a good payoff and spent it well and thanked his lucky stars that this half-assed by-the-numbers piece of Hollywood action schlock has nothing to do with his excellent yarn. It more puts one in mind of Shane and The Man With No Name in its tale of a lone stranger wandering through a small town, attracting the interest of a depressed teenage girl named Lou, and ultimately challenging the vicious criminal organization which holds the entire town in a grip of fear. The character development is much more than one might expect of such a tried-and-true genre and the violence that erupts makes the reader want to stand up and cheer. Souce material---HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Movie---THEY SHOULD\u0027VE PAID ME TO SIT THROUGH IT." }
