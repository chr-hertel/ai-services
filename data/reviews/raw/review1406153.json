So talking AGAIN about all the reasons, is worthless. They are displayed thru all the film. End of story. But some people like the movie! I am very concerned about people who can find this movie funny, or deep or emotional. When did they laugh? When the stupid sister walks in the slippery kitchen floor? When the two brothers fight around the house with that cheesy music? When? The gay couple is a collage of clich√©s, and all the situations surrounding them. So, speaking in therapeutic terms, this movie could be very useful to determine the level of stupidity or the level of the so-called moral values of a person. Be careful. If you laugh or if you cry while watching this crap could mean that you are like this family (or even worst, like the director)." }
