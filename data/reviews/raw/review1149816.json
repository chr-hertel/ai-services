The make-up, the outfits, the warped humour..... it\u0027s all there. The build-up to the actual factory visit is excellent, we were all gripped and excited, like we could actually win a ticket ourselves!!! \n\nThe only negative thing I have to say about this movie is that I thought the Oompa-Loompa singing sections went on a bit too long although they were brilliantly done (I don\u0027t know anyone who likes singing in a movie!). \n\nThe effects are superb to delight the kids and the grown-ups will love the humour. See it..... I want to see it again I loved it that much!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
