She knocks on his head. To his credit, the big guy is polite, listens as Lulu explains she\u0027d like the exchange the package, and gives her slip to find anything else. \"Just look around until you see what you want,\" he says.\n\nHis courtesy isn\u0027t rewarded as Lulu turns out to be a pain-in-the-butt. \n\n\"It\u0027s not what I wanted mister,\" is the phrase repeated over and over and Lulu slowly trashes the place, making an ice-skating rink, flying a kite, etc. The store manager\u0027s slow burn finally erupts - literally - and he has to douse his head under the water cooler!\n\nIt gets worse as the manager makes a total fool of himself in the store window and Lulu goes on further rampages, like skiing down the escalator handles. Little Lulu acts more like \"Dennis The Menace.\"\n\nThis story really tests the limits of the slogan, \"The Customer Is Always Right.\"", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
