Unfortunately after the fourth season this show turned into an incredibly silly TV show. The characters are revisited in the most ridiculous way, such as election of David Palmer\u0027s (black) brother, the storyline and twists are silly and the fact that some of the events portrayed are happening over a period of 2-3 hours is completely ludicrous. Jack Bauer is tortured for 2 years and as soon as he is released, and is fighting evil in what we are led to believe is about 40 minutes time.\n\nEven the emotional response and reaction of people after a major terrorist attack is absolutely ridiculous. Twenty minutes later nobody even remembers it anymore. Overall, I think like so many other shows before it, it has finally lost it and is really not worth bothering with anymore. The first 4 seasons are still quite good and original and might entertain you if you\u0027re the first comer to the world of Jack Bauer.\n\n6/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
