I avoided the film in the theatre because of the negative comments by fans of the books and had assumed that they must have really screwed up the story. I was happily proved wrong when I rented this this past weekend. The story has changed somewhat, but not detrimentally, in my opinion. The special effects are very very good, I really liked how they showed Lyra\u0027s use of the Alethiometre, and Iorec (Yorrick, of course, that drove me nuts while reading the books almost as much as Hermione drove me nuts while reading Harry Potter) seemed remarkably realistic. The acting was a little over the top in places, perhaps, but other than that I thought it ranked up there with the LoTR as adaptations go, especially ones with such rapid fan bases. If you\u0027ve ever seen the atrocity that is Ralph Bakshi\u0027s adaptation of LoTR, you\u0027ll know what a truly bad adaptation is like.\n\nI for one would really like to see the results of books one and two brought to screen. You fans of the books who are dissing the film are doing so to spite yourself. Get a grip.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
