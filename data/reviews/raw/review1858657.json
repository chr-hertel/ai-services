Do not fall into the same trap, this movie stinks. Actors are terrible, and the storyline was unbelievable. If an alien race was able to span the limits of space and be invisible to visible light wouldn\u0027t it stand to reason that they could land a spaceship without crashing it? I rented this movie as a direct result of Hollywood\u0027s lack of anything else to come out of the last years\u0027 crops. I cannot comment on the rest of the story as the movie was so bad that I turned it back in and rented a \"B\" movie instead.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
