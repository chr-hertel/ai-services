While he tries to belittle her, she just sits there quietly mocking him. I\u0027ve only seen two other films from Godard but you can certainly tell that this early film is his. Several of his \"techniques\" that would show up in Breathless are here. The dialogue is sharp, fast and funny making for a pretty neat little film with a terrific ending.\n\nUne histoire d\u0027eau (1961) \n\n** (out of 4) \n\nShort film by Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut. A woman travels through a flooded France when she meets a man who begins to tease her. The entire running time is basically just talk, talk and more talk and none of it is very interesting. My movie books and the IMDb credits Godard as co-director but he\u0027s not listed in the credits and nothing in the film looks like his style." }
