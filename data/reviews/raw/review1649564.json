This is not one of those big budget classics, well thought out, with a great plot, star actors and wonderful screenplay. It\u0027s none of those. It looks like they spent only a couple hundred $ making it...and likely lost money on it.\n\nBut - if you\u0027re a fan of really bad movies, if you find big name movies boring and like to see how bad they can get, this is for you. If you have an iron stomach and won\u0027t blow groceries in the theater, this is for you. If you enjoyed Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes or the Toxic Avenger movies, this is for you. If you watch X-rated movies just for the empty plots and bad acting (this is NOT X-rated, although it does have one sort-of suggestive scene)...this is your kind of movie and you should see it, in that case I highly recommend it.\n\nIt is so bad it\u0027s good. I would love to see it again.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
