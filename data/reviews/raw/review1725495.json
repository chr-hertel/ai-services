Instead, she magnifies insignificant details of a man\u0027s life that demonstrate not Moore\u0027s missteps but her own.\n\nShe tries time after time to show that Moore\u0027s films aren\u0027t flawless scientific reports on their subjects. Is it a surprise that a film might not be a perfect, exacting list of empirical data? Moore\u0027s films have always been under extreme scrutiny, specifically Bowling For Columbine, Fahrenheit 9/11, and now Sicko. Moore is open and honest - he refutes each and every claim of error on his website, backed up with links to the official reports and sources for his information and facts. So the attacks change to \"Yeah, but Moore\u0027s film made is SEEM like...\", that his films somehow imply things not offered into evidence. I think everyone\u0027s hope is that NOTHING is taken at face value - if it is, the fault is with th ignorant viewer.\n\nMuch is spent demonstrating that his \"image\" of being poor, hapless, slovenly and angry is manufactured. In fact, as a whole I consider the entire piece to be an ad homing attack on Michael Moore\u0027s work via attacking Michael Moore. It\u0027s a tool used by debaters lacking actual evidence.\n\nGoing back 20 years to the filming of \"Roger \u0026 Me\", the filmmakers are unable to find confirmation that Ted Koppel had canceled coverage of a town hall meeting (a quick humorous mention in the movie is that the satellite news van was stolen so Koppel\u0027s report couldn\u0027t be broadcast live). This movie then goes so far as to convict Moore of actually manufacturing not one, but all elements of the story. There WAS no town hall meeting. No news van. No Ted Koppel report. They even filmed a phony news reported commenting on the town hall meeting, Ted Koppel and the stolen news van. Of course, nobody mentions this in 1989 when the movie is seen and scrutinized by millions. But 20 years later, they can\u0027t find evidence so it must be a fraud. When a young girl pro Bush was ask if she see the \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" the answer was just great...NO. but I am a sensitive person and I cry when I saw \"Saving Private Ryan\", witch mean: \"I don\u0027t know what is about but I know something else and I proud about\"", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
