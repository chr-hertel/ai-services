There was a great cast of characters, a touching story line, and lots of humor. While predictable in many aspects, it was a feel-good movie in typical Disney (and Herbie) style.\n\nThe first time I watched it, I don\u0027t know where the time went and I walked out of the theater feeling good and light-hearted. To me, that\u0027s always a plus! I really liked the roles played by Michael Keaton, Lindsey Lohan, and Matt Dillon and they seemed to work well together. There were some classic scenes, and Herbie definitely stole the show in many ways. The music added a lighthearted and fun touch to the movie.\n\nIt was good, clean fun -- a delight to show to my younger cousins, who loved it as well, as well as to see with my own Mom, who remembered the original Herbie movies better than I did.\n\nIf you\u0027re looking for a movie that is light-hearted and delightful with some very humorous scenes, I definitely recommend it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
