Like the Czechs, Hungarians and Iranians who came before them, the Romanians specialize in fashioning works of art out of the simplest details of everyday life.\n\nIts story could not be any more basic and straightforward, focusing on two young college women and their efforts to obtain an illegal abortion under the Communist rule of Nikolai Ceausescu (the movie is set in 1987). Gabita is the frightened girl who is farther along in her pregnancy than she has led anyone, even the abortionist himself, to believe. That also includes her roommate, Otilia, who has taken on the task of seeing her friend through this time of crisis. That\u0027s pretty much the entire plot in a nutshell, but what writer/director Cristian Mungru has been able to fashion out of this premise is awe-inspiring in its simplicity and power. Much of the movie is spent observing, in the minutest detail imaginable, the step-by-step process they must go through in order to attain their goal. The movie shuns the hot-button political nature of its subject matter to concentrate on the human aspects instead. Mungru brings an almost documentary-style realism to the film, allowing the scenes to develop in near-real time fashion, while the actors play their roles to perfection.\n\nLaura Vasiliu brings a haunting, almost waiflike fragility to the role of Gabita, while Vlad Ivanov is utterly bone-chilling as the heartless abortionist who is not above exploiting these frightened, confused and desperate women in the basest ways possible to get what he wants. But it is Anamaria Marinca as Otilia, who turns in an award-worthy performance. She manages to create an utterly convincing, fully fleshed-out character without employing a single noticeable actor\u0027s trick in the process. She grabs our attention from the outset and never allows us to turn our attention away from her for a single moment she is on screen (which is most of the time).\n\nLike all great art that draws its strength from a controversial theme, \"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\" never finds it necessary to preach to its audience; instead, it shines an objective light on its subject, then lets each individual viewer search his own conscience and come to his own conclusion on the topic. Yet, this is much more than simply a film about abortion. It is an exploration of the nature of relationships and about just how far one must be willing to go in the cause of friendship. Moreover, the roller coaster ride of emotions - fear, hesitancy, confusion, anger, shame, guilt - that these two women go through in the course of the film is brought to vivid life both by the actors and those working on the other side of the camera. The choices these women have to make throughout are difficult and heartbreaking in the extreme, especially for Otilia who has to decide just how much she is willing to risk, endure and sacrifice for the sake of her friend.\n\nThe movie deflates a bit in the final third thanks to an overlong dinner party sequence that attenuates some of the tension the movie has so masterfully built up until that point, but nothing can keep \"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\" from being one of the best movies of recent times.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
