Narrated by three main protagonists, it follows them through the usual spiral of sex, drugs and parties, all the time each of them searching for a meaning in their confused lives. The most poignant aspect is that their search for purity, and for love, ultimately seems to be a fruitless one...\n\nThe observations of the regisor (man with a movie camera) are deep and mostly hiting the inner states and ironies of the protagonists... A movie that shouldn\u0027t be taken seriously for what you see, but for what you should see..", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
