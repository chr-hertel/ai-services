It is about a curse. A World War II platoon leader is able to see a light in the face of those who will die that day. It is a true curse because he is responsible for them in battle. This puts him in a very difficult position. He can\u0027t eat. He can\u0027t sleep. He also can\u0027t convince others that he is not crazy. Much of the episode is about his efforts to be listened to. He sees the light in the face of his best friend and fellow officer, played by Dick York. This is a human story with a supernatural element. The acting is very good. The war is presented. The faces of the men show the incredible strain of battle. Of course, Serling sets us up for a classic Twilight Zone moment.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
