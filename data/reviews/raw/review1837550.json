There really isn\u0027t a single laugh here, although the various dog tricks are very cute and keep things moving nicely.\n\nUneasy Three, The (1925) \n\n*** (out of 4) \n\nComic spoof of Lon Chaney\u0027s The Unholy Three has Charley Chase playing the leader of a gang who plans on stealing some priceless jewels. There are plenty of good laughs scattered throughout this short but most of them come from a kid who accidentally gets kidnapped in all the confusion.\n\nBad Boy (1925) \n\n** (out of 4) \n\nA man (Charley Chase) will do whatever it takes to please his parents even though they disagree about everything. The early scenes with Chase trying to do construction work are funny but things fizzle out a bit afterwards." }
