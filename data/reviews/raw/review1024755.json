I read the critics on IMDb before I bought it and thought this could work as the both FINAL DESTINATION. There were nonstop lot of twists and turns but perhaps too many effects. So I think even the so recommended Director\u0027s cut story could have been shorter. Yes, there are some nice points but I think it contents too many violence and should not be shown to children. I don\u0027t know why this one hasn\u0027t been presented in our theaters in Switzerland but this could be a reason what I mentioned before. The actors did a great job especially Ashton Kutcher that I saw for the first time surprised me very much. If you want to take an unusual ride don\u0027t miss this edge-of-your-seat-super natural thriller. My wife is not hot for TBE so the end rating is a solid 5/10.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
