A film circumscribed by the Iraq War shouldn\u0027t be just about a stateside murder. But it all made sense to me after I thought about how a writer deals with a tragedy of immense proportionsÂ—in this case the frustrations of finding a murderer amid the confusing tangle of forensic evidence (Where\u0027s CSI when you need it?) tied to a war just as convoluted as the case.\n\nA retired military policeman, Hank Deerfield (Tommy Lee Jones) tries to find out what happened to his son murdered upon his return from Iraq. The web of evidence is distracting: Was he into drugs? Was it a cult thing? Was he affected by a trauma from Iraq? (Elah is where David slew Goliath, an obvious metaphor for Hank\u0027s struggles and the war itself.) Of course, Hank knows better than the police (This is a Paul Haggis film, after all), so he aids considerably in the investigation. I am now satisfied that the TV style investigation figuratively stands for the unknowns about Iraq and the almost impossible strategy to end it. Thus I can endure the crime scene analysis.\n\nIn the Valley of Elah touches on themes of war\u0027s horror, impossibly difficult combat decisions, the importance of family, the need for strong relationships, and the damage of post-traumatic stress disorder, While the film puts too much emphasis on the low-level TV-type investigation, it does a credible job of touching on these thematic issues. However, not enough time is given to any of them, which could have happened if Haggis weren\u0027t so in love with long close ups of Jones\u0027 haggard face, a monument like Rushmore to American individuality and toughness.\n\nBut when that inverted American flag runs up the pole, trouble is brewing. A topless bartender helps a little; a smart cop, Detective Emily Sanders (played by a smart Charlize Theron), helps more; but in the end, it\u0027s Jones\u0027 mug you love to see because you know he knows the war is screwed up, and there\u0027s little he or you can do about it or the murder of a son, be it outside a gun shop in the U.S.A. or on a road in Baghdad.\n\nAlthough the final shot is outrageously heavy-handed, happily Al Gore is not delivering the message." }
