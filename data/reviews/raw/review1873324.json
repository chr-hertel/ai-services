Let\u0027s get one thing straight here, this is not a movie, this is a poorly random series of clips of different people getting high, turning into zombies, and eating their friends. There is absolutely nothing more to this film. You\u0027ll be happy if you stay away from it, far away.\n\nThere is no storyline at all, it\u0027s so amateurish and incohesive that I could have probably done a better job myself, hell, I know I could have done a better job. I\u0027m not being cocky, I\u0027m just stating how bad this movie really is. The acting is miserable as well as the pacing, music, editing, effects and absolutely everything else. There is not one single good thing about this film so do yourself a favor and just walk by if you see it on the movie shelves. I sure wish I had done as much.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
