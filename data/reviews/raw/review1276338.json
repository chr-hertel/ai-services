I felt the movie was much too hard to follow. You almost need to watch it twice...but I wouldn\u0027t recommend that because it\u0027s a bit of a bore. Burton\u0027s character is a disaffected, melancholy spie. That\u0027s a bit hard to watch for two hours. There\u0027s not much action to speak of so the dialogue needs to carry the movie and a moping spie just didn\u0027t do it in this case.\n\nThe movie is not all that suspenseful. The courtroom scene has some but it\u0027s at the end of the movie. I didn\u0027t care for the ending either. I don\u0027t mind movies ending on an unhappy not but I didn\u0027t think it was believable that Burton\u0027s character would basically commit suicide.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
