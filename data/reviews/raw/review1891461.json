I keep reading reviews on this site, giving average scores, with the review saying things such as \u0027What was the point of that scene?\u0027, or \u0027What was the significance of the character names?\u0027. You\u0027re missing the point. Jindabyne is a film about life, about circumstance, about the choices we make and about relationships. If you start pulling apart every scene of a movie, you end up missing the bigger picture. This film tackles real Australian issues, of \u0027Indigenous Australia\u0027 and \u0027White Australia\u0027s\u0027 reaction to the Aboriginal people, of the sometimes unemotional, even (seemingly) uncaring, reactions of men. It isn\u0027t really important what a character is called, or if a scene doesn\u0027t move everything along. Ray Lawrence\u0027s films are more a musing on life and the choices we make, if you\u0027re looking for an action-packed blockbuster look elsewhere.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
