So far youth movies from him i.e nammal and now swapnakoodu have been hits and in my opinion only he can make the best youth oriented Mal movies. Prithviraj was known as a style icon in malayalam cinema after this movie.An average film overall with good songs.Bhavana looked pretty but did her role justice.Cochin haneefa is the surprise element in this movie.He may not be as you think.His best role so far.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
