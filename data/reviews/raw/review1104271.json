I remember being very bored. Viewing it a second time causes one to face such questions as: am I a masochist? Am I trying to avert myself of cinema? Perhaps, I\u0027m just too thorough in viewing these old silent films.\n\nIt\u0027s based on the Tolstoy novella, but literature and cinema are very different media, so that\u0027s no guarantee of any success. The story of Prince Stepán Kasátsky discovering his fiancée was the mistress of the Czar, so he then becomes a monk--eventually Father Sergius is faithful, but I don\u0027t consider that enough or even necessarily important in an adaptation. Co-director Yakov Protazanov was a prolific filmmaker not of the montage school, who made the curious communist sci-fi film \"Aelita: Queen of Mars\" (1924). Ivan Mozzhukhin was probably the major Russian actor of the day. As well, the settings of \"Father Sergius\" are lavish enough.\n\nThe major problem is that the film consists of static, long takes. The camera placement and film technique are common for the day, although prosaic, but the pacing is too ponderous. The bad acting and theatricality certainly don\u0027t make up for it. The scenes that remained in my mind over the years before seeing it again were those of Father Sergius\u0027s seclusion and his torment over lust. I didn\u0027t remember the finger incident, just the dullness. I\u0027ve given the film a second chance, only to add nearly two more hours of boredom to my life.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
