It was THIS camera duo who, by pure ugly \"luck\", filmed the planes hitting the World Trade Center buildings (which you have probably seen). It was also these two men, the Naudet brothers, especially the one assigned to follow the departmental Chief, who entered the Center and kept filming, while the top floors burned. They would capture the last images of many frightened, doomed, brave fire fighters. My heart aches when I see these shots, my anger reminds me it does not dissipate, and I, again  with a renewed sense of awe  keep these people in mind as THE DEFINITION OF HEROISM. These men KNEW there was little chance they\u0027d return once they began climbing up those stairwells  in full gear and an extra 60 pounds each on their backs  with thousands of people rushing down the stairs in a panic, none of the 80 elevators working (in fact, those shafts became the conduit for explosive, ignited fuel to shoot all the way to the basements, making each floor explode from the pressure)  they KNEW. You can see it on their faces. It would take them a full minute per floor to go up, and they had 78 floors to climb before they hit full fire and complete devastation or at least that\u0027s how it looked at the moment. It didn\u0027t go that \"well\", as we know. Meanwhile, paper, glass, metal, fire, and body parts rained over the streets and rooftops of N.Y.C. for blocks. People were suffocating in the smoke. With the camera crew in the lobby of one building, there was a slow, constant rhythm of HUGE, explosive bangs that could be heard just outside people jumping to their deaths, having chosen this over burning. In fact, the bodies were falling at such a fast rate soon, that firefighters and others who were now told to \"MAY DAY MAY DAY!! EVACUATE!!!!\" had to wait for police, who were standing on the outside, to signal WHEN they could run out of the building, so no one was killed by those hitting the ground from 80 or more stories up. This is 120 minutes of inspiring behaviors and personal sadness brought about by the Evil of those killers. WE Shall Never Forget." }
