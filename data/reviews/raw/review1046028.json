The film is well paced and atmospheric but it\u0027s greatest strength is the excellent cast, particularly the three leads. It\u0027s nice to see Christopher Lee playing the romantic role as a change to his usual monsters and Peter Cushing is brilliant as Holmes, his performance being the definitive as he makes the character believable and interesting. This film also features the best ever casting of Dr Watson. Andre Morell moves away from the bumbling fool of other Holmes films and makes Watson intelligent, capable and even dashing. Morell\u0027s charismatic performance is all the more welcome as \u0027Hounds\u0027 is the story which puts Watson centre stage for most of the plot. It\u0027s a shame he never played the part again as he and Cushing make the perfect Holmes and Watson. If only Hammer had made a series of Holmes films.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
