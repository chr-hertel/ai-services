Intense acting, great villain and unexpected action.\n\nSome might not want to see this movie because it goes for a very short 85 Min\u0027s and 88% of the movie is on a plane and just talking. Don\u0027t worry they pull it off very well with the smart and witty dialog.\n\nA PG-13 movie seems to be new grounds for director Wes Craven. But surely enough he has fit as much violence as he possibly can into this thriller.\n\nThis movies strongest point is its cast. This film needed good actors to deliver the dialog and thrills. If they didn\u0027t have those actors the film would have been lost and boring. We had Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers. Cillian Murphy from Batman Begins and 28 days Later. Rounding off this cast is Brian Cox from X-men 2.\n\nThe pacing in this film was great. Just when your thinking its going to get boring they throw a twist at you. Luckily this isn\u0027t a long movie and doesn\u0027t feel like it either. Much better then the other flight movie Flight Plan.\n\nHere is my Flight Plan comment: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578\n\nI recommend. Not too long and not too shabby.\n\n8/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
