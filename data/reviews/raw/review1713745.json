Or Not", "reviewBody": "The three intelligent, well-educated women I saw this film with were, to varying degrees, moved by this story about an under-appreciated teacher who handles troubled teens by believing in and challenging them instead of controlling and punishing them. I obviously wasn\u0027t so crazy about it. Let\u0027s put it this way: if you can focus on inspiring core values and overlook obvious flaws, you may enjoy this film VERY much, and might also like \"Dead Poets Society\" and \"Mr Holland\u0027s Opus.\" If you\u0027re looking for a study of three-dimensional characters facing challenging problems in a complex reality, however, skip this and try \"Stand and Deliver\" or even \"The Blackboard Jungle!\" Ca suffit!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
