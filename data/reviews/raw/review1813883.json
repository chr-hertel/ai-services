Ern says he can make any woman look more beautiful -- I\u0027m here to say it does the same for men as well. Hats off to Ern! \n\nThis run-of-the-mill husband-leaves-home film invokes naps, but has its moments. The \"Fat Twins\" from Arkansas sing like the Andrews Sisters, but take up more space. Ginger Prince\u0027s solo -- The Big Parade -- is fortunately short and unintelligible. Kroger Babb -- the man himself -- makes an appearance as a Hollywood producer. Ern Westmore could have a field day with Krog (a round face). Best part is the introduction at the convention, where the MC announces that Ern Westmore has worked at \"Paramount, 20th Century Fox and...Hallmark Films,\" (Krog\u0027s vast cinema empire). Look for Krog\u0027s un-subtle pitch for his boozy classic \"One Too Many\" in Uncle Marty\u0027s office. Also, a lady does sit-ups wearing an evening dress.\n\nKrog had success palming off his $1.00 \"sex hygiene\" manuals during roadshows for \"Mom and Dad\", but couldn\u0027t peddle too many $10.00 make-up kits with this dud. He would never \"make-up\" his earlier success.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
