Albeit 3rd season slightly weaker due to some character changes.\n\nAlthough to some it will be just another action programme filled with guys and guns. which although it is action programme with guys and guns it has more depth then the usual US pap.\n\nAll three series have strong characters and exciting episodes, just wish the BBC could sort out when they were on.\n\nThe characters such as Henno, Aiden, Jamie are the three main ones each with a different outlook on each and every situation, Aiden - wise officer with a get the job the done attitude and if it goes wrong ill sort it out but not be too happy about it, Henno with a \"it is my duty to do it\" and a \"keep on the mission\", and Jamie the one with a more humane outlook but maybe he\u0027s just not battle hardened, also with Jamies love interest becoming more prominent as the series progresses but never distracting from the main course of action. the sub characters also very good for entertainment and keeping the stories flowing.\n\nAll in all a Dam good programme we have needed for a long while and still need now, which is why i brought the box set." }
