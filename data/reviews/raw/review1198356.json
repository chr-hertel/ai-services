I already have it on DVD but its just the episodes I want Bonus features lol... Does anyone else have it on DVD its so much nicer because there is no Commercials I love this show! Also I like that new show Ghost Whisper too its awesome... I am happy that Medium has made it to a second season and I hope that many viewers will keep watching so it will keep on going. I think that the cast is very professional and perfect for the show. I think the youngest daughter is a laugh... I think that some of the episodes that are to come should be a little more suspense. I wonder if Alison will ever get promoted from Part Time to Full time." }
