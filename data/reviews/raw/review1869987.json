Never has the optical illusion of motion with the mixture of sounds that is movies,affected me so much. I came in, expecting the strange, the sublime, i heard many things about this movie and had high expectations. But after i was done watching, it didn\u0027t have that much of an impact on me, i thought it was OK, i did not get the message at the time, butthe next week, i watched it again, and i got it, i got the message, i understood the genius! the next day i watched it again, and after that day i became in love with this movie! Stanley Kubrick\u0027s best! he takes this movie by the reigns and steers it into the perfect movie. the images in this movie, while not as epic as 2001 a space odyssey, our still certainly incredible! the scene of Alex and his droogs will stay with you for ever! speaking of Alex, Malcom Mcdowell is incredible, he steals the show, the dialog that he speaks is odd and captivating.\n\nthe music is mesmerizing, its hypnotic, classical music playing opposite such \"ultra-violence\" is not the type of music one would first think of for this type of movie. As for the violence, it is not that violent now, in fact it isn\u0027t, back then people were over exaggerating! they had grind house movie worse than this all the time! the real main problem is the rape scenes. There is a lot of it, and i can see why people would find it disturbing, but to me, the way they are shot, makes them just one of the things to love about this movie.\n\nMost directors give you all the answers, so that you can understand the whole movie the first time you see it. Not kubrick. The first time you see this movie, you are tooo distracted by the weirdness of this film to tkae anything out. But the second time trhough, its much more clear. \n\noverall i have seen this movie many times and it never gets old, it is a classic, and one of the best films ever made!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
