It shows Darin\u0027s life as Darin himself might have seen it. He would certainly have approved of the film - maybe his shade does.\n\nSurely no other actor/director/writer/producer could have done such justice to such an amazing story. Spacey sings and dances with an exuberance that is infectious. People who\u0027ve never heard of Darin should be beguiled by the film and learn more. And they will.\n\nSee it!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
