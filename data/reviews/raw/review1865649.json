After you have finished watching an episode, the viewer will realize that the show also included ethical questions, and very real discussions about very difficult current issues--presented in a manner far more engaging than that of your local NPR station (no offense...).\n\nIf you, like me, are hooked by the controversial pilot episode, make the effort to watch the entire season before watching the season finale. You will have been entertained, and--surprisingly in the current television \"wasteland\"--you will have learned something about the people around you in the United States of America.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
