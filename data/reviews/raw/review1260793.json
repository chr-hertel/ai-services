Awful. And there\u0027s a reason for it. And it\u0027s likely a lot of people have scratched their heads over this very same issue.\n\nEvery time Nora has a success she calls in sister Delia to help on the next project. And it never works. Now Nora is credited with some fine work: she wrote Harry/Sally and she wrote and directed Sleepless in Seattle. That\u0027s good stuff, well written and wonderfully executed.\n\nBut what has sister Delia helped with? Ah! How about Mixed Nuts, one of Steve Martin\u0027s worst comedies ever? How about You\u0027ve Got Mail, which had some Hanks/Ryan fans almost throwing in the towel?\n\nHow about Bewitched? Many have not yet seen this one, but given the name of the author, you can start to get an idea.\n\nAnd Hanging Up? It\u0027s a wonder cinemas where it was shown weren\u0027t trashed.\n\nAnd finally - how about Michael? Yes, how about Michael? More shouldn\u0027t be necessary:\n\nIt\u0027s yet another collaboration between the eminently gifted and often inspired Nora and that sister of hers who somehow seems (sorry) to ruin any project she comes into contact with.\n\nYou\u0027ll squirm in your seat, keep close track of the time and an eye on the emergency exit, and suggest to your friends you all go out right away and see a good movie for a change." }
