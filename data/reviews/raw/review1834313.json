If only Adam could write more for Hollywood the world would be exposed to a major talent that\u0027s still undiscovered! I have viewed most of his films and can honestly say this writer director has so much to offer. My favorite is \"My Backyard Was A Mountain\" it\u0027s a well written story that captures you from start to endÂ… leaving you with that feeling of wanting more. \"Father Figure\" is another example of Adam\u0027s great story telling and directing. \"The Stain On The Sidewalk\" is touching and deep. Adam can write from many perspectives and that\u0027s what makes him a great writer! \"We Are All Latino\" shows his support of the Latino community and shows real Latinos with real talents that need to be exposed and discovered by all now! I believe the future is his!\n\nAuxy Espinoza Photographer", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
