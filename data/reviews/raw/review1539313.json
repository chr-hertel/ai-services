The basic premise is so bizarre as to ensure emotional ambivalence in every viewer.\n\nThe unfolding of episodes... eagerly awaited in this corner.... has taken a rather bland direction over episodes 6-9. But episode ten seemed to capture the magic again. I notice that the main writing credit goes to Kevin Maynard. \n\nMay Mr. Maynard have many more opportunities to keep a good show good. It seems his efforts raised the bar. I hope those in important places regarding the show production take notice.\n\nbbovee-1", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
