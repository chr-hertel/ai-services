Or at least the part responsible for good, sound moral judgement. Maybe I\u0027m just dulled from seeing contemporary newscasts, but the most shocking feature turned out to be the ample supply of untrimmed 1970\u0027s bush.\n\nThe only other thing worth noting was that the German soldier kept shouting \u0027raus, raus\u0027 at a prisoner even when she was already well out of the truck. Clearly one of the supermen. Didn\u0027t stick around long enough to get in to the rest of the storyline. I can see the artistic merit of the lead figure, though, in a Lacanian sense: 10 points for inventing her, minus 7 for putting her in such a sh@tty movie. Can\u0027t wait to skip through the 3 sequels.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
