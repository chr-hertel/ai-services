I haven\u0027t seen the original double dare, but people say it was really good so i\u0027m going to have to watch it sometime. I was pretty young when the show came out, six, and I didn\u0027t know about it so i never watched it. But when I was 10 I saw it and I loved. I kept watching more of what nick gas gave me to watch like, get the picture, figure it out, GUTS, etc. and they are all pretty good shows. But I love double dare 2000. I also like it that they have families. Jason is a very good host. Though I wish I would\u0027ve been older when these shows came out because I would really like to be an audience member. I\u0027m 13 now and I never get bored with these shows:) overall- 10/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
