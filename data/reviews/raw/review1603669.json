Its neatly balances mainstream appeal, by obeying the fundamental conventions of horror, with sophisticated satire of the genre\u0027s clichés and tendency for conservative discourse.\n\nWhen viewed retrospectively, the efforts of successive films in the genre, and the parody of it in the (at best) sporadically charming Scary Movie, may lessen the impact of this film. Nonetheless, this potential criticism itself stands as testament to Scream\u0027s influence and its legacy of having reinvigorated and informed what had become a tired and clichéd genre.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
