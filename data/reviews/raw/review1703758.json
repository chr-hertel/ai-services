It\u0027s one of the films that will be loved by people who can relate to it, and I\u0027m one of them. Dan Millman is Rocky for new generation. And who would\u0027ve thought Victor Salva, who made Jeepers Creepers 1 and 2, was behind this. I\u0027ve wanted to see Peaceful Warrior since the first time I saw the trailer, I\u0027ve read all the raving reviews about how amazing and life-changing the book is and I was absolutely hyped for this. I wasn\u0027t disappointed, not even once. I think this film\u0027s message is so powerful, and so profound that it puzzles me why this was so under the radar during it\u0027s release in the cinemas. I\u0027m a \u0027sucker\u0027 for inspirational films - I think they\u0027re the one way to get people to learn something from them and take action in their own lives.\n\nPeaceful Warrior has now become one of my top favorite inspirational films, up there with Dead Poet\u0027s Society, and Rocky", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
