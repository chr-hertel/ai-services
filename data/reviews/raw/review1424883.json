Scott) who also hates drug lords. He also gets one on one mental help with a female shrink (Who of course is hot, after all, in action movies any woman who pursues intellectual duties also looks as if she just posed for Playboy)who helps convince the jury he\u0027s innocent due to insanity. I\u0027m also guessing that a love scene wasn\u0027t out of the question since she wears quite revealing clothes around Lamas and he hits on her constantly. In any case Snake Eater II:The Drug Buster is part of my three part review of the DVD set I never asked for. I read some positive reviews (Indeed the two external reviews, average this one at 7/10) saying that it is better than # 1, I can\u0027t disagree, although it\u0027s only of the slightest improvement. This time the production values are slicker, the action sequences more elaborate and the script more tongue in cheek but it\u0027s still a Lorenzo Lamas movie and although i\u0027m betting this is one of his better efforts, I still refuse to give this more then 2 stars. Such as the case here, this is the perfect guilty pleasure B.movie, nothing more though.\n\n* * out of 4-(Fair)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
