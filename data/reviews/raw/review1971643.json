As in, you\u0027re watching a \u0027documentary\u0027 that\u0027s actually just a scripted movie, made to look and feel like a documentary.\n\nMy biggest problem with the show, is their \u0027go to\u0027 outside advisers of the Warren\u0027s, who were made famous for their \u0027investigations\u0027 of the Amityville murders, which were shown to be completely fraudulent, just based upon the police reports of the family\u0027s deaths! (such as the eldest daughter actually having been involved in the entire thing, to the point of possibly even helping with some of the deaths!) Then there\u0027s the way they constantly jump to blaming demons for everything. Not to mention how haughty the group is about what cases they take. They don\u0027t want to help those who need it most, they just want the weirdest cases, that will get them the most press and attention.\n\nThey\u0027re complete frauds, plain and simple.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
