Muggs\u0027 idol turns out to be a stuck up kid who wants nothing more than to forget the old days now that he is a successful jockey. undeterred Muggs continues on his quest and eventually has the chance to ride a champion horse.\n\nVery good East Side Kids movie that nicely balances the serious and the silly. Muggs attempt at bettering himself and the gang is nicely handled, and the craziness of the gang prevents things from getting too dark.\n\nDefinitely worth seeing for both fans and non-fans of the series.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
