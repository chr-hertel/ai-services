It\u0027s short enough to keep you interested and a lot better than some of the other horror duds that have come out in the last few months. The film has a really nice look to it (especially for a low-budget ), the director and cinematographer clearly know their stuff, with a quite colorful look to it all. Also, the opening scenes of the film are quietly tense, we know something is going to happen, but aren\u0027t sure what or when. It is one of the few Dutch horror films that have actually surprised me and kept me guessing right up until the end.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
