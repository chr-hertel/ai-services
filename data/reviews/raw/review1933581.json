He brought life to the man in a very believable way. I particularly thought the interaction between the Pope and the Cardinals was not only fun to watch, but brought out the strength of John XXIII\u0027s personality in an area not many people realized. Considering that many thought him to be just an elderly, interim Pope, he certainly had a great impact on the Catholic religion throughout the world. And it\u0027s still being felt. He had a lot in common with Pope Benedict XVI in his farsightedness and strength belying his age. PBS should show the movie again, sometime - now would be a good time with the recent visit to many countries by the current Pope.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
