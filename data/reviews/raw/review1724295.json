Okay on it\u0027s own. 8 mile meets Dahmer? Why Zombie?", "reviewBody": "This film would be average if it was a stand alone, but by hacking into a classic it shows a blatant disregard for what John Carpenter envisioned. I do not understand the psychology of Zombie who felt it necessary to neatly and tidily explain away Michael\u0027s evil. The beauty of the original was that those of us who had nice homes could harbor an innocent enough quiet child who one day snaps for no apparent reason. Instead we get an eminem 8 mile Dysfunctional family and a Kiss Rock and Roll fan Momma\u0027s Boy turned serial killer. Zombie then wants it both ways, super explaining and justifying earlier actions and later moving to a cold blooded killer who goes after those who seek to help him and then gong back again to caring about family, thus as confusing and inconsistent as I\u0027ve just described. This movie ignores the fact that in the original, we saw older, seemingly stable parent get out of the car in the opening scene. This is ignored and an unstable family i inserted.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
