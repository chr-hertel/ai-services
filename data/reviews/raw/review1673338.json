She then blackmails the same guy into trying to do the same to her new stepmother (Sybil Danning). The disturbed girl at one point even locks her young step-brother in an old fridge in the middle of a junkyard.\n\nI saw this film almost back-to-back with another, much more terrible Sybil Danning-starrer \"They\u0027re Playing with Fire\". But while that film was a horrid hybrid of a dumb 80\u0027s teen sex comedy and an idiotic 90\u0027s erotic thriller (featuring Sybil in the sack with the annoying kid from \"Private Lessons\", and the once great Andrew Prine flushing his career right down the toilet), this film does the burgeoning erotic thriller genre proud (or as proud as you can do that crappy genre). It has a real, if not necessarily highly believable, plot and pretty decent acting. Other reviewers have compared it to \"The Bad Seed\", but it is actually better than that stagey, melodramatic flick (which ends with the villain literally being struck down by lightning). I\u0027d put it somewhere between that one and a truly deserving classic like \"Pretty Poison\" (with Tuesday Weld and Anthony Perkins).\n\nThis movie is certainly no classic, but it doesn\u0027t really deserve its current obscure status either. It\u0027s probably Danning\u0027s best (American)movie. Those who watch it just to see her take her clothes off for the zillionth time won\u0027t be disappointed of course, but I think they\u0027ll also be pleasantly surprised with the rest of the movie." }
