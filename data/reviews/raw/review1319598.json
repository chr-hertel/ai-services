The proprieties at all times\"\n\nIt\u0027s lines like that courtesy of Frank Nugent (from \"Green Rushes\" by Maurice Walsh), spoken throughout this wonderful film by among others, Michaleen Oge Flynn, the town\u0027s tippling matchmaker \u0026 bookmaker as played by the whimsical Barry Fitzgerald that help make John Ford\u0027s homage to his Irish homeland, \"The Quiet Man\" (1952)such a delightful classic! \n\nIt\u0027s that by-now well-known-yet-simple story of an American fighter (John Wayne as Sean \"Trooper Thorn\" Thornton) retiring across the sea to the village of his ancestors awash in magical, mythical sentimentality and Irish tradition that also helps mightily. \n\nIt\u0027s the astonishingly beautiful Technicolor cinematography of Winton Hoch and second unit director Archie Stout, who two decades earlier filmed most of the Duke\u0027s earliest two-reelers for Lone Star Productions up around Lone Pine at the foot of the High Sierras, that help make the film what it is. \n\nIt\u0027s the John Ford Stock Company: Ward Bond as the priest, Arthur Shoelds as the Protestant minister, Mildred Natwick as the richest widow in town, Ken Curtis as the local with the tenor of gold, and of course, Victor McLaglen as the antagonist, the brother-in-law performing roles they were born to play. The characters, down to the smallest role, all magically come to life.\n\nAnd finally, it\u0027s the chemistry of two marvelous Irish actors, John Wayne and Maureen O\u0027Hara that are the icing on this cake. \n\nDoes the Ireland of \"The Quiet Man\" exist anywhere over there anymore? In my heart, I sure hope so. \n\nThis is a \"must see\" moment of thoroughly entertaining cinema.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
