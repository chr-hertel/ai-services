I fell in love with Little Britain at the start of series 1. Series 2 and 3 both had flaws but were great also. I went to see them live and was blown away. It was the funniest thing I had seen in a long time.\n\nWhen my Fianc√©e and I heard about Little Britain USA, we couldn\u0027t wait, we watched it, I think I laughed (halfheartedly) about once.\n\nI think that the characters were \"Lost in Translation\", by which I mean that whilst trying to appeal to both Americans and British people, the characters and jokes had lost all of their comedic value.\n\nWhilst I respect Walliams and Lucas for what they have done for British Comedy. It doesn\u0027t quite work in the USA.\n\nP.S. The canned laughter doesn\u0027t work at all. The live Studio audience gave the British series an authentic and natural quality", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
