When Glory becomes a yearling, Clarabel\u0027s \"Gram\" (Charlotte Greenwood) puts the horse up for sale (she has warned Clarabel to \"never fall in love with one horse\") for they need the money badly - but sad, sad Clarabel is helped out by local millionaire youth Chad and a horse doctor who prevents the sale. Clarabel and Chad have tons in common since, after all, all he talks about is horses, apparently - one problem, it\u0027s rumored he is engaged to one Candy Trent, who is one rich stuck-up snob. Well, Glory is trained for racing and proves to be a fast runner, and Clarabel decides to enter her prized horse in the \"Kentucky Derby\", even though it\u0027s rare for a filly to have a chance to win against the colts.\n\nThis film is a decent B-movie with a racehorse theme, mildly entertaining, painlessly pleasant. It oddly switches gear about the middle of the way through into a semi-musical (with several rather mediocre songs thrown in). Clarabel plays guitar and sings to her horse, then suddenly she is heard in the stables by a good-looking radio celebrity and hired to sing on his show, a second little romance to follow for her (but you just know she\u0027ll always be loyal to horse-lovin\u0027 Chad). There is a bit of history of thoroughbreds related at the beginning of the film including a shot of real-life Triple Crown winning race horse Citation; the finale features real footage of a Kentucky Derby race. For fans of Margaret O\u0027Brien, it is so nice to see her in one of her almost adult roles - she\u0027s a charmer, but unfortunately the weak script doesn\u0027t really give her much of a chance to shine here. A side story features favorite character actor Walter Brennan as her \"Uncle Ned\" who constantly bickers and yells back and forth with Clarabel\u0027s Gram (but it appears they secretly really like each other!). Cute, lightly entertaining film - nothing great though.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
