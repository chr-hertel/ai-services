HARDLY! I found this movie boring and unimaginative. I mean, fantastic, COME ON! I could pull more fantastic sh!t outta my @$$ with less material! It has a good premise but doesn\u0027t strecth the limits of imagination. I\u0027m not saying this is the worst part, but this movie isn\u0027t really that great. It could never sdtand up to time traveling greats like Back To The Future or H.G. Well\u0027s The Time Machine. In my opinion, go with The Philly Experiment, It looks, and feels more interesting...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
