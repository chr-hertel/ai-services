Their first stop is to visit a meteor crater in the isolated Wolf Creek National Park. When they go to their car, they find that it does not start and without option, they decide to spend the night in the car. Later, a local friendly man, the hillbilly Mick Taylor (John Jarrat), stops his truck, offers to help the trio, finds that they need to replace the coil and proposes to tow them to his camp, where he could fix the car. When they accept the proposal, their dreamy vacation turns into a scary nightmare.\n\nThe story of \"Wolf Creek\" is not original and seems to be inspired in the \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\". But there are differences in this attractive Australian film, beginning with the previous development of the characters in the first half, when the story begins like a dramatic road movie. The second part of the story is pure and very realistic horror, with excellent performances of John Jarrat, Cassandra Magrath and Kestie Morassi. The scenes are very authentic, with the frightened girls making bad choices, like for example, leaving the rifle with Mick, not stabbing him when he was unconscious; or driving the truck down off the cliff. The direction Greg McLean is also great, using a handy camera many times and transmitting the sensation of fear and disorientation of the characters in some moments. I personally did not like the conclusion, but I liked and recommend this little gem of horror. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Wolf Creek  Viagem ao Inferno\" (\"Wolf Creek  Journey to Hell\")", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
