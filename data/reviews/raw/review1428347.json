Nick, having recently married wealthy Nora and having no problem telling everyone he married her for her fortune, has retired from the detective business when visiting back in New York is asked by an old client\u0027s daughter to help her find old missing client. Along the way we are introduced to a handful of suspects that might have wanted to kill the old client or could even be him himself. While I enjoyed the red herrings and the mystery, it is definitely secondary to the by-play between Powell and Loy who have oodles and oodles of screen chemistry and great comedic timing when delivering lines. Loy is just wonderful as she pushes her often drunk husband back into detection so she can see what he used to do. Loy is at once beautiful yet unpretentious as a wealthy woman no less. This ability to do this is quite an achievement. Powell is equally as good musing about whatever after hoisting another drink. Of course, the biggest scene stealer is their dog Asta. This is classic stuff here by classic actors. Director W. S. Van Dyke knows how to make the most of the talent he has at hand. All of the supporting players are very good and the end finale with Powell having everyone over for dinner so he can tell who killed who is a real gem. The prevalence of drink in the film, though the impetus for much of the humour, is also a bit saddening as it must be that which keeps Powell and Loy so happy in their marriage as they never seem to be without! A true classic!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
