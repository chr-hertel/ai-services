Out of Apatow\u0027s stress, bitterness, anger and undeniable raw talent, comes \"Undeclared\". Unfortunately, he took the idea to Gail Berman\u0027s Fox network in the middle of the gluttonous reality show fad. But before that inevitable cancellation befell the unluckiest guy in the business, \"Undeclared\" was a charming, intensely enjoyable little concoction.\n\n\"Undeclared\" doesn\u0027t just take the kids from high school to college, Apatow advances it into a contemporary setting, cuts the length in half and this time goes for straight comedy instead of a dramatic mix. Also families who felt they could gather around \"Freaks\" should hed the warning that \"Undeclared\" is decidedly more adult, delving into all the sophomoric humor and sexual situations you\u0027d expect from a group of guys on their own for the first time - but under Apatow\u0027s lense, you\u0027ve rarely see it with this level of sophistication.\n\nMirroring Apatow\u0027s search for public acceptance, \"Undeclared\" stars Steven Karp (perfectly cast Jay Barucel, play quite possibly the most unabashedly geeky main character TV has given us) as our underdog college freshman who seeks to change his geeky high school image with his new found freedom at UNEC - the University of North Eastern California. With the help of his roommate, British ladies man Lloyd (Charlie Hunnan) and suite-mates Ron (Seth Rogen, \"Freaks and Geeks\", now blessed with a meatier roll and writing credit) and Marshall (Timm Sharp, \"Six Feet Under\") they seek any means to amuse themselves between the late-night cram sessions and all-day Girls Gone Wild binges. \"Undeclared\" captures the sheer boredom of the freedom that comes with college better than any show I\u0027ve ever seen. Across the hall is Steven\u0027s new crush, Lizzie (Carla Gallo), and dorm hotty Rachael (Monica Keena, a star in the making). Most of the action takes place inside the dorm and like \"Freaks\" it is populated with a colorful group including suit-mate Susan Payano, \"the new Harris\" Jared Groddie, Amy Pohler and Steven\u0027s divorced dad, Hal (Loudan Wainwright III), who can\u0027t seem to stay away.\n\nThis time, now desperate for a hit, Apatow is trying to hard to please, lining up big name guest star friends like Adam Sandler, Fred Willard, Will Ferrell, Mary Kay Place and Ben Stiller. But the real fun, particularly for Apatow fans, comes when the \"Freaks\" alumni start showing up and \"Undeclared\" becomes a full-on class reunion. Jason Segal about steals the series once again in the obsessive boyfriend role. Samm Levine, Martin Starr, Busey Phillips, Nattasha Melnick and Steve Bannos all make return appearances in new characters. Levine, in particular, is an absolute hoot as a pickle-obsessed frat leader in the must-see 2-part satire of fraternity life \"Rush and Pledge\" and \"Hell Week\".\n\nOK, I\u0027ll admit, neither \"Freaks and Geeks\" nor \"Undeclared\" may not sound like the most compelling thing in the world on paper. But Apatow\u0027s genius lies in his ability to create characters so real they could be your best friends and fosters a tightly cohesive chemistry among the cast. He makes us love each of them in some way. The show is made up of individual moments, a highlight being a dance-off between Keena and Payano that threatens to bring back OMC\u0027s \"How Bizarre\". The laughs live almost entirely on character bits. Like \"Geeks\", this is a show you lounge in. Its world is so lasting that, with only 13 episodes, \"Undeclared\" is one of those shows that grows in your mind the more you think about it and the further from it you get.\n\nThe saddest part of all this is that \"Undeclared\" was canceled right as it appeared to have hit it\u0027s stride. The first half of the series, while still fun, is clearly a work in progress before the show finds itself and we kick into classic material in the last half. \"Freaks and Geeks\" is a modern masterpiece and it says a lot that this semi-sequel is a worthy follow-up. Those stung by the short life of \"Freaks\" should find solace in this gem. \"Undeclared\" was not just another trip to the clich√©-free teen series for Apatow, but it is the quintessential modern college series. Hip, insightful, compact, funny and lots of fun. Of all the recent shows that where cut down too soon, \"Undeclared\" ranks high on the list. It is one of those TV shows, like \"Geeks\" that will be appreciated by those who don\u0027t even like TV. \n\n* * * * / 5" }
