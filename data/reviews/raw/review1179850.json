The movie was well done in it\u0027s presentation and unique depiction of a troubled war. The only downside was the director\u0027s vision of what the film was to be, switching between an army slapstick, like the movie Stripes, and a military mystery, like the movie Basic. I found it left the viewer at times wondering if we are to laugh or to just sit there in silence. On the bright side, the acting was well done. Each actor gave something special to this picture. Jason Biggs showed he can take a step away from his American Pie typecast and really deliver a dramatic performance worth noticing. As well, Sean Tucker added an extremely hilarious comedic injection to this movie. In my opinion, he WAS the comedy in this movie and should be recognized for it. All in all, a well done effort and a movie that should receive the accolades it deserves.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
