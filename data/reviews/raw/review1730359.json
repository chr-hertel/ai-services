Best action movie of the year.", "reviewBody": "We had to wait twelve years after the Die Hard Trilogy but once again has a great action trilogy been made. To anyone who doesn\u0027t believe this movie deserves it\u0027s Top 250 spot, think of it this way: The Bourne Ultimatum is a representative of the whole trilogy and as the best of the trilogy, deserves it\u0027s spot. I truly believe it\u0027s unique for a third installment to be better then the first or second one. In fact I would go so far as saying the first one is the worst of the series, even though I love it to death. Matt Damon gets his chance to shine once again and I\u0027m really happy he\u0027s finally getting recognition. He\u0027s a great actor and a lot of his films are worth seeing. The Bourne Ultimatum is a must for action movie fans. It\u0027s the year\u0027s best ( of the action genre) even though I enjoyed the controversial Die Hard 4.0 too. 300 rates better on CGI but both Die Hard 4.0 and 300 are seriously lacking intelligence compared to TBU. I hope they don\u0027t do a fourth, the trilogy is too legendary already to ruin with an uninspired and unnecessary sequel.\n\nThe Bourne Ultimatum is Paul Greengrass\u0027 best and I really hope it remains in the top 250 even after the hype passes. Overall impression: phenomenal.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
