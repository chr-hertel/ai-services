I\u0027ve been involved with music, and women making music, for a long long time, and this film rings true to everything I\u0027ve experienced. Gina Gershon and Drea DeMatteo are terrific -- good casting job all around (although Lori Petty comes off more like folksinger Jill Sobule than a punk guitar goddess). Not sure whether Gina sings the songs or if they\u0027re dubbed (I suspect the latter), but she\u0027s got great rock star moves and is even believable as a tattoo artist. Drea is dead on as a party-hearty rock chick guarding her vulnerable side. And, oh, yeah, they\u0027re also kind of hot. There are a lot of DIY-type full-length songs, most of which are enjoyable, if not quite ready for prime time. If you\u0027ve ever grooved to Joan Jett\u0027s \"I Love Rock and Roll\" -- you\u0027ll appreciate this movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
