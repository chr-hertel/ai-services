The relationship between bother and sister is portrayed in a beautiful and moving way here, you can\u0027t help but fall in love with this movie. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates good anime. I\u0027m usually really picky with movies as I watch loads however this movie met my high standards and thats why I\u0027ve given it a 10/10. Its as good as \u0027Spirited away\u0027 which is also fantastic and if you enjoy this movie I recommend you watch that next. I\u0027ll be surprised if this movie does not make you cry :]\n\nwatch it :]!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
