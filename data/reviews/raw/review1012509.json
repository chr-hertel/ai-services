I\u0027m not surprised, but that\u0027s not the reason I love it.\n\nThis movie starts with a premise that could be light, silly, trite, or promising but disappointing. Through deft writing and Murray\u0027s amazing comic timing, it manages to be none of those. The movie just keeps getting better the longer you watch it, and every silliness comes with a bit of serious thinking behind it.\n\nTake home from this movie: A visceral awareness of what really matters in life, and how your own attitude in it is really everything there is. Not just mostly... entirely everything.\n\nThis movie threatens at first to go on forever, but after a while I wished it would. It compresses the lesson of \"It\u0027s a Wonderful Life\" into its first act, and then improves continually from there. I honestly can\u0027t think of how this movie could be improved.\n\nTo see how bad this movie *could* have been, watch \"Multiplicity\" with Michael Keaton. Then watch \"Groundhog Day\" again and enjoy. I\u0027ve lost count of the number of times I\u0027ve seen it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
