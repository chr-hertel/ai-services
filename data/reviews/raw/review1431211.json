The plot is not that important. Within the hour people start being rendered into meat and meat by-products. This is pretty much in line with the preview which hinted at three horny guys looking for sex in Europe, and then getting drawn into a new level of R rated violence, which is exactly what occurs, without further nuance. The only thing the movie adds to the preview is more violence. It doesn\u0027t get deeper, more clever, or more interesting. This could have had the power of Bue Velvet or Last Tango in Paris, but it quickly gets run through the Hollywood formula which removes any trace of believability or interest. Instead it\u0027s pretty much a retread of Friday the 13th in which sexually-active teens are mutilated; the moralism that feeds the country.\n\nThe characters are super bland. They have the most normative of sex. They \u0027make love\u0027 to some super-models. The movie is little more than hetero boy wish-fulfillment. You get to see some boobs on hot chicks and there\u0027s enough homophobia to reassure nervous viewers there\u0027s no possibility the movie will veer into any unexpected direction. You even get to hate Europeans. bonus. And gay people are back to being twisted psychotic sadistic freaks! double bonus. The guy gets to be heroic and save the chick (uh, well sort of).\n\nGee what brave choices.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
