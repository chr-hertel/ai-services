I thought this was an excellent movie- warm, funny, and very family oriented! It was charming for me to see him in a not-so-action based role, and at that, one with children! It was so cute! Especially watching his character deal with diapers! This movie also possessed a lot of versatility- it was the perfect blend of men \u0026 action, women \u0026 love/drama, and kids \u0026 values. The ultimate in family night movie compromises that everyone will like!Also, it gave a good voice to a range of living issues from dealing with peers, teachers, and children, all the way to major issues like death of a loved one, or being an orphan. This movie is both entertaining and very etiquette driven. I definitely will be buying this movie upon DVD release!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
