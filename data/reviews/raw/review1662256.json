It was so repulsive I thought for sure it was a snuff film. However, every time I went to press stop on the DVD remote, I found myself pressing pause long enough to have my stomach settle and then my morbid fascination wanted see what happened next. I have read numerous reviews on this movie , many found it to be a dark love story. The only thing I could see , besides a spider waiting to catch a fly, was a man who wanted to live out his ultimate fantasy. Too me his love was the flesh not the man in it. Anyone wanting to watch something gut wrenching, this is a movie for you. Also for the ones that are not ready for something this extreme the movie \"FEED\" is a fun, yet twisted movie, but it is much easier on the stomach. One question to all that own cannibal, what does the picture on DVD case have, is it the man standing in front of the house or he is kneeling behind the man in the bathtub with outstretched arms (this is the one I have)? I am sure they are the same movie I just like the other cover better.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
