Carlson is a bland but likable hero (essentially the same character he would play in another 3-D classic, CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON), and the plot is a typical mixture of eerie thrills and paranoid fantasy, with a neat structure and predictable outcome. But it\u0027s the imagery which lingers in the mind: The huge spacecraft lodged in the side of a mountain, towering over Carlson just before it\u0027s buried beneath an avalanche (watch out for those flying rocks!); the humanoid figure which rises out of the desert gloom to flag down a car driven by heroine Barbara Rush; the telephone wires framed against the sky, transmitting unearthly sounds which betray an alien presence. The aliens themselves may induce giggles in today\u0027s audiences (they look like a one-eyed blancmange!), but no one can deny the visual impact of Clifford E. Stine\u0027s black and white photography (try to see it on the big screen) and Herman Stein\u0027s theremin-charged music score (try to hear it in stereo sound). Directed by Jack Arnold.\n\nNB. Projected at 1.85:1 aspect ratio in some venues, though the movie was clearly photographed with Academy 1.37:1 ratio in mind and screened that way in most theaters.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
