The Dark Knight is the greatest super hero movie ever made. Some might even go so far as to say it\u0027s the best movie ever made, but don\u0027t put me in that faction. Sadly, saying this is the best super hero movie ever isn\u0027t really saying much considering it really only had itself (aka Batman Begins) to outdo. It goes without saying the super hero genre has been notoriously weak, with exceptions being: Richard Lester\u0027s Superman II, Richard Donner\u0027s Superman, Tim Burton\u0027s Batman \u0026 Batman Returns and Jon Favreau\u0027s Iron Man. \n\nTDK is epic. It runs for 152 minutes and there really is little or no fat in those two and a half hours. Director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonah shared screen writing duties and they have to be given tremendous credit for capturing the dark and distinct tone of graphic novels, in addition to penning subtextual elements critiquing certain moral and ethical hot button political issues. The plot is deep, dark and shares more in common with The Godfather than anything else in the super hero genre. In other words, this is much more than a mere comic book action movie.\n\nIn fact, Nolan should be given credit for reinventing the genre, by taking it out of the realm of mere spectacle and for making its themes, story and characters the centerpiece. Whereas most comic book movies before TDK could be considered kids movies, TDK is unquestionably one for adults. Nolan\u0027s reinvention began with Batman Begins when he immersed Batman, Bruce Wayne and Gotham in the real world and with TDK Nolan ratchets up the realism by making a film that\u0027s as dramatically engaging as it is visceral. A fair amount of press has been given to Nolan\u0027s commitment to reproducing reality (via practical effects/stunts vs. CG) and there\u0027s no question the action feels palpable, but as impressive as the technical aspects behind TDK are, it is the writing that separates it from everything else in its genre.As impressive as the Nolan\u0027s writing and directing is, it\u0027s impossible to ignore the collective work of the ensemble cast. Not since Michael Cimino and his epic ensemble pieces has there been an A-list level of ensemble excellence associated with a true Hollywood blockbuster. While many big budget films assemble impressive rosters of Academy Award winning actors, they seldom demand little or no heavy lifting from their stars. TDK is, refreshingly, an exception to this current trend of throwaway performances.\n\nWithout debate, Heath Ledger\u0027s turn as the Joker will cement the late actor\u0027s reputation, leaving admirers with little else to do but ponder what more this gifted actor could have accomplished. Ledger\u0027s disturbingly psychopathic Joker is an impressive counterpoint to his quiet and tortured performance in Brokeback Mountain proving Ledger not only possessed incredible range, but was easily the most talented (and interesting) actor of his generation. Yet, as exciting as Ledger is to watch as the Joker, this is Christian Bale\u0027s film and he turns in an equally impressive (yet far more subdued) performance as the psychologically complex and tortured anti-hero / industrialist Bruce Wayne. Bale literally seethes with contempt throughout TDK and if you\u0027ve ever read Frank Miller\u0027s graphic novel Batman the Dark Knight Returns then it won\u0027t take much to envision a fifty-something Bale reprising the role of Batman down the road. With a little luck Nolan will be back at the helm.\n\nMy plan is to return to the theater to see TDK again. I don\u0027t do this very often since few films warrant any reason to. The last time I did so was three separate screenings of Children of Men. COM is, in my mind, a contemporary masterpiece. Does TDK stand up to COM? Is it better?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
