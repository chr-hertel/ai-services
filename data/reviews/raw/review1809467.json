The film charts the course of Plainview\u0027s life over 30 years as his fortunes rise and he descends into madness.\n\nGoing into the film I was carrying a great deal of baggage. The promise of a truly great film is tough thing to have to live up to. Hailed by many as a classic film on par with many of the cinema\u0027s greatest offerings I\u0027m left to wonder if its all hyperbole since the film has barely been on view to the public for roughly a months time and true classics are created in the long term not the short. It will be for time to tell us if the film that has been fashioned here is the masterpiece or an also ran.\n\nFor me the film is very good, but I found it considerably less than the \"one of the greatest films\" that the film has been handed by some critics. To be certain the film is excellent on almost every level technically. It is sterling achievement of the film maker\u0027s art. The problem for me is that the film falls apart in the final stretch and collapses into simplicity in the final scene. Its rather hard to discuss this with out going into detail, something that may or may not ruin things if you haven\u0027t seen the film. Since I don\u0027t want to spoil anything I\u0027m going to choose not to discuss things other then to say the denouncement did not work for me and in a way renders most of what happens prior less than it seemed.\n\nI do think that the film is worth seeing. I just think it\u0027s not the be all and end all or recent American cinema.\n\n8.5 to 1927, considerably less after that. 6.5 over all", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
