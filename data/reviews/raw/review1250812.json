But because of some IMDb members reviews I was afraid to watch it. Well, let me tell you, this is a very nice movie. There\u0027s nothing lewd, nothing that could offend anyone, and it has it\u0027s funny moments too. You may not like it if you\u0027re into all that heavy Drama or action-adventure stuff. People complain about the poor acting, which is something else that made me nervous about watching it, but they all did a great job for musicians. Seeing Louis perform was fantastic, another reason to get this would be to see him. Great casting as well. Seeing James Gregory as the Priest was a real treat.\n\nWell, it may be just me, but I really like this movie. I can\u0027t tell you that you\u0027ll love it right away, it\u0027s really a \"hit or miss\" type of thing. Depending on your taste and/or personality you might like it, you might not. The only thing I can tell you is to try it out and see for yourself.\n\nBut if I had to sum it up, I\u0027d say, if you love Louis Prima and if you like fun carefree movies, I\u0027d go with this one.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
