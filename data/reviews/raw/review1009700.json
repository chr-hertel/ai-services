The remastered and tinted DVD copy makes all the difference I feel over the stark and poor copy of Caligari I saw, the obvious bookend for this.\n\nThe tinting is a bit exuberant at times: looking out of a window in green, cutting to a yellow outside, and then running into a red room. There were some gloriously sunny days when UFA was making this! The acting was patchy but bearable, costumes and sets superb, and the story sufficiently off-centre to surely intrigue modern cineastes.\n\nOther people have passed the more erudite comments on this re German Expressionism, and the looming tragedy for Germans of all races and religions, but imho I didn\u0027t think it was particularly expressionist in the overall concept. The sets were outlandish with no straight lines, but is this the most important criterion? I base my feelings solely on the fact that I always have an uncomfortable ride with G.E. films and artwork, and I didn\u0027t with this. Well a worth a watch, I\u0027ll certainly be back again soon.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
