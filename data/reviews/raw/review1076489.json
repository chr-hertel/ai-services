The punchline: I was there with two guys I worked with, who barely knew me, and there were only about fifty people in the theater. What a movie! It rocked from beginning to end... The stars in this movie were the Beatles of their day, the Stones of their day... Many of them have made major comebacks due to Public TV extravaganzas (So, where\u0027s the DVD?) The split screen is fun, giving the movie a pretentious look: \"This is serious business, younsgters\" on one side of the screen, and \"We\u0027re having a whale of a time\" on the other side of the screen. I have begun a campaign to get it re - released -- I kid you not! I want my DVD!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
