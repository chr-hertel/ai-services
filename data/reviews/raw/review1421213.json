It achieved one thing which was being a gross picture which created an account of a unlikeable person like the Earl Of Rochester, and most of this was due to Depps performance. Stephen Jeffreys screenplay from his play is solid although all the ideas don\u0027t work in this picture and at times it is boring and slow. The performances are good as JOhn Malkovich and Samantha Morton were very good in their roles in the film.
