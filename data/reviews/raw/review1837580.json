We follow Satan through four periods including the crucifixion of Jesus and the Spanish Inquisition. The film is visually beautiful and the set design is remarkable but the stories are all deadly boring. The third segment, which is the longest, is downright bad. The first segment with Jesus has way too unintentional laughs and it\u0027s rather strange that Jesus looks a lot creepier than Satan!\n\nThose expecting a horror film will probably be disappointing as this film plays out more like a historical drama." }
