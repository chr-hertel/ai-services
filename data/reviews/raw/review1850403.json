They were separated for a time, after all, and both took up with others. Before the episode is over, the wife and Olivia are involved in a horrific car crash (which I could see coming a mile away, in fact as soon as Olivia volunteered to take Mrs. Stabler to her doctor\u0027s appointment while Elliot pursues a felon to upstate New York). The rest of the episode is pretty predictable. Not the worst episode, but too personal and chummy and not enough going on otherwise. Also, Olivia, God bless her, is starting to show her age.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
