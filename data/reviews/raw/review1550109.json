It is just plain bad.", "reviewBody": "The reaction I have with this show is the same as when I used to watch \"Remote Control\" and they had that segment called \"Dead or Alive\" where they would say name of celebrities and contestants would guess if they were dead or alive. Here is almost the same: They announce the people on that and I always catch myself \"Oh, he/she is still alive?!?!?\". They are so Zlist celebs, half of them I have to search on Google to see what they do, there is always one or two though that you cannot believe they are there ( Jerry Springer, sometimes you gotta say NO to your agent) Then the competition, awful the dancing , the remix is worth a lawsuit (\"Now Mario Lopez will dance the salsa\" - And it is the salsa remix of Like a Prayer). The judges are boring, even more than ... I cannot even think of another show with such bad judges. Even America\u0027s Next Top Model have better judges.\n\nThe show is a parade of has-beens/never-beens/never-will-beens wearing horrible costumes, dancing like no one does (not even at bar-mitzvah would you see dance like that)with horrible remix on the background.\n\nI assume they cater that for women and gay men. but I think only bad Midwest people get it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
