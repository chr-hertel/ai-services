What can i say about Little Miss Sunshine? It was one of the greatest movies I\u0027ve ever seen. If you have not seen this movie then please watch it. It is a brilliant movie filled with comedy and drama following a family full of problems. I loved every character in this film and every moment of it. The ending was a very funny/heart-warming ending also. Because even through everything they experience throughout their trip, they became a stronger family. This movie just sent chills down my spine. The directors did a wonderful job on bringing this movie to life. The cast was a phenomenal cast. No one could have played those characters better. This movie is definitely on my top 5 movies. So if you haven\u0027t seen it yet, as soon as you finish reading this comment go out to your nearest movie rental store and rent this movie. Hopefully you will feel the same way about it as i do.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
