Is this a bad thing? Absolutely not. It is the director is the one who brings the whole movie together. If a film works, it means the director did a good job. But for a director to have done a truly fantastic job, in my opinion, he must leave a certain stamp on a film that makes it uniquely his and elevates it to a different level. In the case of Notes on a Scandal, the film belongs to a volley of individuals, none of which are director Richard Eyre, I\u0027m afraid.\n\nThe first in the series is screenwriter Patrick Marber. I haven\u0027t read the source book, as is usually the case with many films (I more than often find myself reading the books after seeing the films, unless it is the case of a popular book such as The Lord of the Rings), but judging by the movie alone I can only guess that Marber had a lot of strong material to work with. The plot is thicker than a brick with winding twists and turns one can\u0027t even begin to second guess. The events of the film are engrossingly thrilling and the plot never at any point drags or stalls. It\u0027s constantly moving, constantly unfolding, and just an utter thrill to watch, absolutely delicious. Also, as with his work on Closer, Marber seems to have an uncanny knack for writing sharp, stinging dialogue that at once seems utterly impossible that would be spoken by a person in the real world but also seems totally and entirely natural. Either way it\u0027s exhilarating to hear, his choice of words is absolutely and utterly fantastic and wonderful in every way. The film is, if anything, fantastically well written. But most importantly of all, in Barbara and Sheba Marber manages to craft to fantastically rich and rounded characters, which are an absolute thrill to watch and are so three dimensional and realistic they are absolutely impossible to read or predict. No clichés here.\n\nBut the true king and queen, or rather queen and queen of the film are its two lead actresses, Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett. Dench is simply visceral, absolutely and frightfully vicious. Detractors of her Oscar nomination, I strongly suggest you see the film before you criticize: It is a performance more than worthy to note. It is at once absolutely chilling and monstrous, and at once almost painfully vulnerable and exposed. Dench is simply the master of her craft, there\u0027s nothing else to say. Her performance is nothing short of mesmerizing. It only helps that the character she portrays, Barbara Covett, is one of the most rounded, believable, tragic and fascinating characters I\u0027ve seen in a film from this last year. What a fascinating character study this film constructs, a truly tragic individual who has to use such evil and vile leeching of other, younger women to fill the atrociously gaping holes in her own life. But not close behind her and equally worthy of note is Cate Blanchett, who is one of my personal favourite actresses and one of the most consistent, reliable and talented leading ladies working today. It\u0027s unfortunate to me that in what may be the best year of her career with four fantastic lead film roles she only managed to land one Oscar nomination (I would have more than welcomed a Best Supporting Actress nod for her fantastic work in Babel), but by taking a look at her future projects it seems she\u0027s a long way away from veering into the territory of mediocrity and uninteresting projects. I absolutely adore this woman; she\u0027s so rich and fantastic to watch in the film. And like Barbara, the character of Sheba Hart is absolutely fascinating, just utterly transfixing. Her life is at once privileged and at once difficult, and yet her reasons for launching into this scandalous (and illegal) affair are so incredibly ambiguous it\u0027s simply a pleasure to try and read her traits and actions. Both actresses deliver performances more than worthy of endless praise. But not to be forgotten is the always-wonderful Bill Nighy, who with this film truly proves his range from awkwardly comic (Love Actually) to purely dramatic (Notes on a Scandal) to just plain incomprehensible (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man\u0027s Chest). He truly displays wonderful talent in this film and stands his own very well despite being overshadowed by the two actresses.\n\nFinally but not at all least is Philip Glass. As with directing, cinematography and pretty much all other elements of film, my judging of a film score is based on two very basic factors. The first is if it stands out in any way and is memorable and stays with you after the movie is over. The second is if it works as a good piece of music on its own, separate from the film. In Notes on a Scandal, both categories are more than met. Glass delivers what may just be the best film score of the year  well, after Clint Mansell\u0027s unbelievable work on The Fountain, that is. His score is fierce, violent, grand and soaring, and totally transcends the simple purpose of guiding the audience\u0027s emotions by acting as a continuation, an enhancer of the film\u0027s already ferocious and fiery emotions as they are. It\u0027s a fantastically thrilling and totally memorable piece of work. Oscar worthy indeed.\n\nIn all, Notes on a Scandal is an absolutely fantastic piece of work. The plot is thick and scorching, the characters fantastically well-rounded and realistic, the dialogue fierce and sharp, the acting utterly transfixing and everything is tied together by Glass\u0027s riveting, powerful score. A success on all levels.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
