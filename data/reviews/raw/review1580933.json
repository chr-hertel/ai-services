Best Commentary Ever!!!", "reviewBody": "I am sure you are all aware of the history surrounding Mr. Ferrara\u0027s first proper film the \u0027Driller Killer\u0027. It has achieved most of it\u0027s notoriety due to it\u0027s distinction of being one of the first so-called \u0027Video Nasties\u0027- films banned by the UK due to lurid content. From what I have gathered after watching the majority of these \u0027Video Nasties\u0027, is that this was some sort of backlash and hysteria by the moral police. If you go into this film expecting gore-filled mayhem and over-the-top violence you will likely be very disappointed...\n\nHowever if you go into this film with no expectations, you will likely be amused and entertained. This film will be much more enjoyable if you are over 30 and from the glorious, sleazy NY before it was sanitized. The dirty punk rocker sleaze factor oozes nicely from this film and I found it very satisfying...\n\nKeep in mind, this was Abel\u0027s first film and it shows. Some of the shots are rather extraneous, and certainly a few of them could of been framed better. The pacing does a lag a bit in spots, and some of the dialogue is rather inane (I actually find the inane dialogue to be charming and amusing)...\n\nThe factor that elevates this DVD to \u0027must-purchase\u0027 territory (I am referring to the Cult Epics version), is Abel Ferrara\u0027s amazing commentary. He is obviously on lots of strong drugs and his stream of conscious rambling really enhance the viewing experience. he is very quick to point out flaws in his film with wild abandon. It is also lovely to listen to him oogle the actresses and ramble off incoherently in stream of consciousness Frankenstein quasi-sentences...\n\nIf you are a punk rock child from the 80\u0027s you will probably appreciate this film much more than the casual viewer. I hesitate to call it a horror film. It is more of an Art-house, drugged-out, sleazy portrait of early 80\u0027s New York City set in a slasher film regarding man\u0027s frustration and gradual descent into madness. Check it out, and please re-watch with the commentary. I promise you will be amused (and amazed)...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
