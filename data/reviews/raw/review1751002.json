Well written and terrific acting! Story keeps moving and you never look at your watch thinking \"man, is this over yet?\" Laughed out loud at several points in the movie. Although it is a comedy, some parts were very \"true to life\" and hit on the not-so-pleasant aspects of growing up and being an adult. The synopsis makes this movie sound like a \"guy\" movie (road trips and beer - the male equivalent of \"chick flick\"), but it really is SO much more. I\u0027m suggesting it to everyone I know - guys and girls alike! Everyone will be able to relate to something in this film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
