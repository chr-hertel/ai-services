I\u0027ve made it a habit to see as many as possible. Even the rip-offs they\u0027ve done have been cool like EXORCISM And WHEN A KILLER CALLS. This is just plain lame. I can\u0027t believe that the same people who made DEAD MEN WALKING and DRACULA\u0027S CURSE actually made this movie too!!! It\u0027s not even laughably bad like JOLLY ROGER or ALIEN ABDUCTION (which, by the way are pretty bad). This is just BAD! I mean, I can appreciate and/or forgive bad acting or lame special effects in an Asylum movie, but this film takes itself way too seriously. I really hope that SNAKES ON A TRAIN is better. Now that\u0027s a movie I can\u0027t wait to see.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
