The acting was horrendous without exception. Even Kelly Hu, who is usually good eye candy and who had like 5 lines in the entire movie, was made into a simpering, lovestruck henchwoman.\n\nIt had some fairly big names, mostly past their prime, but they didn\u0027t deliver the goods.\n\nI don\u0027t like to tell people what to see - folks should really be able to do whatever they want - but I have to make an exception this time. It is truly awful. In short, don\u0027t waste your time.\n\nWhat\u0027s amazing is that a sequel is in the works.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
