It is easy - perhaps too easy - to forget that \"People\" invented Rock \u0027n Roll and not corporations. Having been there when it was being \"invented\" I was fortunate enough to see the tremendous talent, energy, and love that were poured into the invention. More than 30 years later it was more than wonderful to see that talent, courage, love, and a willingness to do something with it outside the Corporate Envelope is still alive and well!\n\nGreat Flick, Great Video, Great Music all done for pennies on the dollar ,,, Hollywood, eat ya heart out!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
