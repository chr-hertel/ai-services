Maybe even better. It\u0027s raw, real, full of laughs and pulls every heart string. I believe, wholeheartedly, that if this show was aired now, it was have a massive viewing audience. I think ten years ago, the public wasn\u0027t ready for it. Now that Judd Apatow has had some serious box office hits (Knocked Up, etc.) the public might be more receptive to F\u0026G.\n\nMy proposal: Judd Apatow, write a Freaks and Geeks movie with all of the same characters. Yes, John Francis Daly will be much taller and I\u0027m sure some of the other freshman (i.e. Martin Starr) may look a little older. I don\u0027t care what plot twists might have to be added to make it work, but I think it would be incredible.\n\nI just watched the final episode, again, and was choked up. It never gets old. \"Ripple in still water....\"", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
