(2nd season)? looks like this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_My_Time_of_Dying, but performed by another artist\n\nif somebody known something about it, email me please ;)\n\n\u003d\n\n\"This show was in my opinion the most cleverly written, and best acted cable series EVER! Perfect casting, great stories, and FUNNY. You could not ask for more. Why Showtime wouldn\u0027t renew this show after season two makes no sense. Rent, or buy both seasons of this and enjoy! Absolutely great! From the outset all the characters and of the reapers as well as the intertwined plot of the living are blended perfect. It\u0027s so interesting as the series moves along to learn how each character met their end(except for the leader Rube, as I don\u0027t recall his demise was ever mentioned). Ellen Murth just pulls of the lead character so perfectly. Brilliant stuff all around in every episode, and not even the Sopranos can say that!\"", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
