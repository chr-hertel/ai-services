The bee did not talk; it just made cute little squeaks and groans. Its wings fluttered fast like a hummingbird\u0027s, and it had a long trunk for a nose. I think there may have been a couple of them who flew around together. I am pretty sure that this was one of the short animated clips from the old Pinwheel television show, but it could have been on another Nickelodeon show. Any help finding some information about these little creatures or even some photos or video clips is appreciated.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
