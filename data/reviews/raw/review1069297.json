This film has no point what-so-ever. There is no relevance to it at all. Normally in your regular run of the mill MTV production film there is some kind of goal within the film, in this sadly there isn\u0027t. The characters lack definition and any sense of comedic value. I think this film is for all the geeks out there, not trying to sound too harsh, but it really is. ND\u0027s whole family are geeks, and so is his friend. These are the characters in the film that we are meant to relate with? No thanks MTV productions, you can keep this film locked away.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
