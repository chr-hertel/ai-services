This time I feel it\u0027s time I stopped being lazy and actually gave my opinion.\n\nBrokeback is a hell of a movie. Watched it with my teenage kids hoping I wouldn\u0027t feel the need to reach for a cushion. (Head honcho male and male underling in the wings, fairly conservative ..open minded females showing no interest to view the film, in the same audience)Silence at the end of the movie then positive review with excited debate rehashing the experience demonstrates on this occasion a top shelf movie.\n\nThe movie is a masterpiece of nuances. The director\u0027s vision has seen the characters explode onto the screen and reach into our very being. The sexual struggle is enthralling and captivating.\n\nThe beauty of the movie incorporates the picturesque scenery plus the understated reality of people doing their best to fit a world they are desperately trying to feel part of. \n\nHire it or buy it. You won\u0027t be disappointed.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
