I always find the accent discussion funny, because there really isn\u0027t one NY accent, nor is there one Italian-descent NY accent. There are always variations based on how your parents spoke, to education, etc...My thought on Roberts is that his performance is so overbearing and over the top that it makes the accent seem brutal. He was asked to play an annoying, luckless, idiot and just took it to the Nth degree. No one I\u0027ve ever met is that annoying and still has people who want to spend time with them at the end of day. This happens too much in the formula - the \"eternal loser\" character is taken far too much to the extreme. To the point that you\u0027re just wishing someone would put them out of their misery. Roberts performance just becomes a variation of \"Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, son\". PS - the ending is ridiculous in just about every way possible." }
