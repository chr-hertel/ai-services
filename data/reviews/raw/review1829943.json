What I got instead was a film full of too many coincidences, telegraphed escalations of racism, and seemingly unrealistic decisions undertaken by characters. Just about every time some profound act of racism occurs in this movie, there is some \"dramatic\" music that plays and the film goes into pseudo-slow motion. The movie also features a racist Tony Danza, and a lack of representation for the Asian characters in the movie. Every race gets to make a positive example of overcoming race, except for the Asian characters. Overall, I felt this movie tried to spoon feed me a message." }
