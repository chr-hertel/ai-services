Not the least funny.", "reviewBody": "I used to be a Rowan Atkinson unconditional fan until I saw the unexpectedly mediocre Bean film (which actually had its funny moments, no matter how poor the script was). The disappointment was already tremendous at that time, but I did not want to admit then that Atkinson\u0027s career was on the wrong track. This \"Johnny English\" made definitely obvious that my worst fears had become true: Atkinson\u0027s ability to make me laugh has vanished. I don\u0027t know if I must blame the actor, but one can only say how unconvincing he is now in his usual \"so-stupid-would-be-spy-that-no-matter-what he-does-ends-up-as-a-catastrophe\" act. Every single gag is foreseen 3 minutes before it happens. The embarrassment was huge when I watched this lame parody. John Malkovich doesn\u0027t help either. His unbearable overacting made me sick. Sorry if I am too honest about it. But I sincerely disliked this film. Bought it second-handed at low price and deeply regret my money.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
