Part of that great beginning was the cinematography, a real eye-grabber particularly in the first 5-10 minutes.\n\nThe story begins to drag after awhile and it wasn\u0027t worthwhile sticking with it all the way - even though I did - because the ending is very unsatisfying.\n\nI didn\u0027t recognize Rebecca deMornay, she looked so young. Val Kilmer, too, must have been at the beginning of his career. Being a TV movie, the language was pretty tame, which was nice, but the story just didn\u0027t deliver. It\u0027s not something I would give a second look.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
