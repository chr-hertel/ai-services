This movie portrays one day in the life of several car wash employees in LA. They get a gaggle of wacky customers (including Pryor as cool dude Daddy Rich). Also, some people are trying to develop relationships with each other and such things. Among the other people in the movie are George Carlin as a taxi driver, DeWayne Jessie (aka Otis Day in \"Animal House\") as one of the employees, and also Antonio Fargas (who apparently played Huggy Bear on \"Starsky and Hutch\"). Maybe the movie is very much a product of the \u002770s, but that\u0027s part of what makes it so great. A true comedy gem.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
