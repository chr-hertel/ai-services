I thought at first that there was something wrong with the sound system in the theater I was in. There is a constant buzzing throughout the movie Â— it sounded like a field of locusts. I had to leave after an hour and twenty minutes because I just couldn\u0027t stand it anymore. If the movie were otherwise compelling, I might have suffered through the headache-inducing noise, but the scenes were so slow and long, for no ostensible purpose. If each scene had been cut by one-third to one-half, there would have been no loss of content or dramatic narrative and the movie might have been improved considerably. But it still would have been a movie focused on two foul, shallow, uninteresting people.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
