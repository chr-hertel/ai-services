But instead it was not that way. More than a thriller I would have considered it as a drama. Never boring, never exaggerating, never irrealistic or Hollywood like, which would have been the case if Jim would not have died at the end, but saved by her premonitions. Sandra Bullock is simply fantastic in this role. Actually the whole cast is perfect. A great movie that makes you think and that leaves you with something inside. If you love somebody, just let them know. Don\u0027t wait.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
