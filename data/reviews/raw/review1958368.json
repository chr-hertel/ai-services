Very cool premise, right off the bat.\n\nHas an excellent first scene, gotta give credit where credit\u0027s due.\n\nHas solid characters and a decent enough script for a ghost story but here are the things that bothered me: Whenever the ghosts appeared, which I really liked by the way; how it was done, how it looked...the only thing was the ghost\u0027s relationship. Because of the way things went down in the first scene you\u0027d think their dynamic would be different.\n\nThings slowed down a little too much in the middle I felt, and the crab/spider scene was just not good. BUT then the ending is actually very good! Sure, \u0027The Grudge\u0027 basically told the same story with a polished lens but no samurai\u0027s and that\u0027s what I liked about this movie comparatively.\n\nPlease, someone one with a tempered style remake this movie.\n\nFans of \u0027Silent Rage\u0027 would absolutely love this movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
