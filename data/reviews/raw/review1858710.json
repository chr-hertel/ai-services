I really do enjoy the jokes.\n\nBut really, this is one of the best film-music I have ever heard. This film is a must if you enjoy good comedy that doesn\u0027t go over the line and just become a mess like \"Meet the sparans\" or \"Superhero movie\".\n\nI don\u0027t really have word for how awesome the music of this movie is good!\n\nNormally I hate musicals, because I think the music is pretty empty and shallow, but the music in this movie has very good rhythm and funny lyrics but still good written.\n\nI give this movie 10/10 because of the music, but the movie is good to.\n\nYou have to see this movie!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
