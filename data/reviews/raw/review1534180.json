But it also lacked what would make it a better bad-movie entry for me. It\u0027s actually a poorly made film even with the sort of guilty-pleasure interest in it all. The director, William F. Claxton, who directed a lot of TV (including many Twilight Zone episodes) and scads of B movies, decided that absolutely nothing was really worth putting in in terms of a) character development, b) story, or c) anything eye-grabbing in the slightest in the non-killer rabbit sequences. That it has a few names that stick out for me as a movie buff- some more than others (Janet Leigh, quite a fall from the heights of movie stardom, DeForest Kelly, who is spiffy and awesome in a mustache even if he\u0027s given nothing to do aside from looking McCoy on us, and Rory Calhoun, who barely has a facial expression to change and has been in many B-horror movies)- is a little staggering.\n\nWhat\u0027s a little surprising too, hearing from the people I watched the movie with, was that this was an actual problem in places in Australia and the US, where rabbits really did act as an epidemic and destroy people\u0027s crops with over-population. So the basic premise of it isn\u0027t actually that bad. It\u0027s just that what ends up coming out is really either very funny in an unintentional way or just non-sensible. Most of the characters, even with those that are given kinda sorta something to do here and there like Leigh\u0027s character and her daughter (like when they have to fend themselves off from the killer rabbits with, um, dynamite I guess), are just stand-ins for big declarative statements and boring dialog. So why watch a flick like this? Well, frankly, I wanted to see how the filmmakers would approach something as silly as killer rabbits (which, no less than three years after this film came out, could be found in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, probably unintentionally too, who knows).\n\nThey\u0027re filmed basically in telephoto, with their menacing mouths rabid and foaming or just with big little buck teeth, and in big groups going against models behind them ALWAYS in slow-motion. Needless to say it\u0027s not scary, but it becomes like a really crazy comedy, which of course all leads up to an even crazier climax of finally killing off all of the mutant bunnies. But even this is a little unsatisfying; I know Claxton isn\u0027t doing Alexander Nevsky here, but even for a cheap B-movie the style is really out of whack. In how the rabbits are seen approaching, and approaching more, and then guns go off, from where who knows, and then when the rabbits finally come into formation- in front of the stretch of cars driven by everyone in town over at the drive-in (who also, as with everyone else in the film that\u0027s human, have absolutely no reservations or questions about why there are, well, mutant rabbits all abound), and finally how its all edited together in the big shoot-out/battle. The editor, John McSweeney, makes the material that is pretty funny in a goofy way into a sort of big jumbled mess of carnage (a good deal of it repeated shots, not just in the climax but elsewhere), and pretty incomprehensible when it should be a big gas of a scene.\n\nThis all being said, in a very tongue-in-cheek way, I dug what the filmmakers were trying to do, which was a fun scary movie with known stars and sturdy character actors, and pit them in a movie with a terrifying, unstoppable menace (ironically, a menace that doesn\u0027t really EAT humans, just vegetables). It\u0027s got the main package all set-up, and it\u0027s content to only deliver in a less than average way. I wouldn\u0027t say not to see it, if only as a crude curio and inside joke as part of the Matrix, and most especially if you\u0027re with a group of friends and a few drinks. It\u0027s just that But I also found too much that went in the way of it being an enjoyable bad movie all the way through.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
