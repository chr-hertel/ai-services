I had no idea how good it was going to be when I selected it.\n\nGripping and moving throughout, the acting is amazing, and the underlying politics deep and dark. To the best of my knowledge historically accurate, this is an extremely well acted historical drama illustrating the age long conflict and, ironically, harmony between the Abrahamic beliefs.\n\nThe movie takes you through voyage of middle eastern mystery and keeps you guessing all the way.\n\nReally, watch it to the end for the real clincher!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
