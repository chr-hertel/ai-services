Dane Cook sucks. Dane Cook is the least funny \"comedian\" ever. I put \"comedian\" in quotes like that because I don\u0027t really think he is a comedian at all. Just like I would say Dane Cook is not an actor but an \"actor\". He is a \"comedian\" and an \"actor\". His stand-up comedy is horrible. His acting in this movie is at least as bad as Dennis Rodman\u0027s, and that is saying something I am sure you will agree if you have ever seen Dennis Rodman\u0027s \"acting\". Dennis Rodman is probably as good at doing standup comedy as Dane Cook is at \"acting\". This movie is awful. They couldn\u0027t even spell the title right. Simon Says this movie is one of the worst ever.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
