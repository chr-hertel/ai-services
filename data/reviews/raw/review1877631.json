Mildred Coles plays Jessica Vance, the young heiress who isn\u0027t so sure she wants to marry the society bigshot that her mother has picked out for her. She gets her own apartment, meets the locals, and tries to find her own prince charming. It\u0027s a lot like watching an episode of Father Knows Best - no surprises, no big names, plain, simple entertainment based on misunderstandings. One of Warner Brothers shorties - only 57 minutes. Edward Norris does a good job as one of the suitors. Keep an eye out for William Hopper, the son of Hedda Hopper, as Blaine\u0027s original best man. This was one of the last films directed by Noel Smith -- he only made a couple more after this. It\u0027s also ironic that they keep talking about going to Honolulu, since in just a few months, terrible things were about to happen there...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
