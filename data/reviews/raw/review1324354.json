I walked into the cinema expecting to see a film packed with action sequences as this was coming from the makers of the matrix.\n\nAnd though there were plenty of action sequences and some of the most stunning special effects i had ever seen what really separated this movie from other sci-fi action films was the storyline. It was a film that is actually relevant to what is happening in our world today and what could happen.\n\nAll in all a excellent film that anyone can enjoy at a number of levels. You can sit back and stare at awe at the special effects or you can get sucked into the storyline and both methods do not fail to deliver. A must see.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
