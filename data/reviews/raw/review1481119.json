First off, let\u0027s all pretend that it was a unknown filmmaker who made this film. Then let\u0027s pretend again that is was unknown actors in the lead roles. So we watch this film and we wonder how this ever got financing. This movie obviously was about 2 drafts away from being ready to be shot. And the directing was terrible. My DOP friend shoots better things by accident on his DVX-100 camera than this film. Bad, bad, bad. Come on people! We all have to admit this. This man of once great filmmaker has completely lost it. And I think he knows it too. We all need to do a boycott. Especially the actors out there who still need that Woody Allen film on their resume.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
