The fact that the average person may find the whole thing unfunny and bland is due to their just not being smart enough to understand and appreciate this masterpiece.\n\nThis was a very painful and dreadful experience for me--watching this Danish film. It\u0027s a shame, really, as I have loved all the other Danish movies I have seen and had very high hopes for this one. Plus, with the word \"Mifune\" in the title, I really wished the movie had SOMETHING to do with this great Japanese actor (which it really did not). However, because the director chose to use so many disgusting images (I felt a need to bathe after seeing it) and because everyone in the film ultimately seemed so awful and selfish, I really didn\u0027t care one bit for anyone--except maybe a bit for the very annoying and under-socialized mentally retarded brother. In fact, every time I THOUGHT I liked a character, the writers had them then behave in horrible ways that guaranteed you\u0027d be turned off by them. While it is true that real human beings are complex (often likable and not likable), the dichotomy was just too striking and unrealistic in this film. And, because of this the characters just didn\u0027t seem real. So, by the end, I just wanted them all to go away---the girl, the \"smarter\" brother and even the mentally challenged one. Just go away and let me pretend I didn\u0027t waste my time seeing this depressing mess.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
