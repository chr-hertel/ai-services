A beautiful evocation of a time and a place, cinematically stunning, musically spare and poetic, unremitting in it\u0027s executions of the will of violence and the struggle of men. But to me, The Proposition is a rumination on White Man\u0027s Burden, a fraught incursion into the moral morass of Australia\u0027s Aboriginal genocide and Christian hypocrisy, ignorance and fear. The disregard for the Aboriginies is pivotal to Arthur\u0027s (Danny Huston) madness, while Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) must toe a line, one which nobody seems able to comprehend, in pursuit of civilization. Biblical homage can\u0027t get too much closer than one brother\u0027s murder of another, and the paradoxical simplicity/majesty of the basic acts resonates vibrantly throughout The Proposition. So, while I am less familiar with director John Hillcoat, I do know Nick Cave, so I can more easily attribute my visceral movements to his artistry, with no disregard to Hillcoat\u0027s direction. Nor any toward Guy Pearce, a chilling Huston or-(one of my absolute favorite actors)-Winstone. This is truly one of the best films of recent memory.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
