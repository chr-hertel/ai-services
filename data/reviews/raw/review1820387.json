I must have watched this a hundred times back in the day, and when I bought the DVD recently I could still remember some of the dialogue.\n\nMadonna plays Nikki Finn, a young woman jailed for a crime she didn\u0027t commit. When she gets out she decides to seek revenge.\n\nGriffin Dunne (whatever happened to him?), plays an attorney for his fiancée\u0027s father (John McMartin). The future father-in-law asks Loudon to take Nikki from prison to the bus station and to make sure she gets on the bus, as part of a supposed new public relations programme. A seemingly easy task, but there are complications aplenty, some funny dialogue, and some admittedly stupid-but-funny scenes along the way.\n\nMadonna has a stupid voice in this film, which until I was able to watch with subtitles made one or two lines of dialogue incomprehensible for me (hence only 8/10), but on the other hand I can\u0027t imagine her doing it in her normal voice.\n\nThis film shows Madonna\u0027s comic side (too lacking these days, perhaps), and she genuinely is funny in the role. Dunne makes a great foil, while Haviland Morris is perfect as the uppity fiancée.\n\nYes, it\u0027s predictable, yes, the jokes could be better, but I think this is a great film and will happily sit down and watch it 100 times more.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
