Indeed one of the best ways to begin to understand the inter-relationships of various species is to concentrate on a certain area rather than globally. \"When Dinsoaurs roamed America\" is, like Russell\u0027s classic book, just such an attempt. In specifying locations known to most viewers world wide the producers grounded the extinct animals in real life. The restorations of the dinosaurs seemed to owe a great debt to the brilliant work of Gregory Paul. There were parts of the movie to warm the heart of paeleontologists such as Jack Horner and Robert Bakker, as well as parts to infuriate both men. Perhaps it is a testimony to the even-handedness of the writers that offence could be given to almost anyone interested in paeleontology. Goodman\u0027s authoritative voice seems well suited to the material while the CGI work is simply superb. It is amazing what can be done today. The great Ray Harryhausen would have needed several lifetimes to equal the animation in this programme. I enjoyed it immensely and hope that the producers will see fit to make \"When Dinosaurs Roamed Europe\", \"When Dinosaurs Roamed Africa\" (and give us a truly terrifying vision of Carcarodontosaurus and Spinosaurus) and \"When Dinosaurs Roamed Australasia\" and \"When Dinosaurs Roamed China\". I would recommend this programme very highly.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
