People are way too hard on this movie, and they have improper insight about it. This film was good, and Halle Berry was a much better Catwoman than Michelle Pfeiffer. The only reason why many people liked Pfeiffer better is because she was a backed by a certain dark knight that couldn\u0027t have possibly been in the new movie. \n\nTo begin with, Catwoman is supposed to stand alone in this movie. That\u0027s why her name has been changed from Selina Kyle to Patience Phillips. That\u0027s also why her costume is completely different and why the story has nothing to do with the original Catwoman. Also, of course she isn\u0027t going to look like Michelle Pfeiffer\u0027s character. This isn\u0027t supposed to be Batman Returns 2! It\u0027s not even a spin off. Elektra is a spin off to Daredevil, but this was supposed to shine more light on a not so popular character in the DC Comics series. \n\nPatience Phillips is not supposed to be the new version of Selina Kyle. Patience is a new Catwoman. As the movie explains, there have been many Catwomen, and Selina Kyle was one of the previous ones. That\u0027s another point that I feel necessary to express, because that is something that I\u0027ve heard many people criticize the movie over, as it was a completely new character that had nothing to do with Selina Kyle. It\u0027s not supposed to!\n\nAnother major problem with this movie is that there was another certain comic book flick that sparked new light on the box office ratings for that time frame that was released only weeks before. Yes, I am specifically referring to Spider-man 2. Almost everyone that saw Spider-man 2 loved it, and it was a smash hit movie the summer that it was released, which was the same summer that Catwoman was released. I think that everyone that saw Spider-man 2 and loved it expected Catwoman to be just as good, or close, because it was two comic book films that were released around the same time, and that\u0027s what disappointed them. Catwoman is not nearly as good as Spider-man 2, so if you haven\u0027t seen it yet, and you\u0027re expecting it to be as good as Spider-man 2, I hate to be the messenger to tell you that that\u0027s not what you\u0027re going to get, but apparently, it seems to be I have to be the one to deliver the bad news.\n\nThe only complaint that I had about the movie was that Sharon Stone bombed as an actress, and that affected Laurel Hedare\u0027s potential charisma. She was a terrible actress in this movie, as you could tell she was saying a line when she spoke, but it barely affected my overall opinion of the movie, because it\u0027s not even noticeable unless you pay the attention that it takes to notice. In other words, you have to know that that\u0027s what you\u0027re looking for. \n\nThis is a good movie, and I strongly disagree with the complaints that many people had about it in past reviews. I believe that they were just looking for things to find wrong with the movie, because they expected another Spider-man 2, and with my regards to the many who agree with me, this isn\u0027t nearly as good, but it\u0027s still a very good adventurous ride that will cause you to think differently of Halle Berry if you always thought ill of her before.\n\n8/10!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
