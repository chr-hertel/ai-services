It is such an intriguing masterpiece. Joan Hackett and Roy Thiness have great on screen chemistry and we found ourselves drawn into their illicit affair. We never could have imagined the actual outcome of the movie. In fact, my three sisters and I still have our different opinions as to who Roy Thinnes actually was(the doctor or the gangster). The musical score heightens the suspense and the beautiful ocean views certainly add to the romantic aspects of the movie. The site review for this movie is very misleading. I would have created a much better synopsis. I would pay anything for a copy of this movie. The musical score is just lovely and the scenery breathtaking. The ending is, of course, a real tear jerker." }
