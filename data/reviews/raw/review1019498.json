This is another recent release and though I believe there is no distributor yet for the US, you should try to see it if you can. I left the theatre feeling many of the same things I felt when I saw Hotel Rwanda, but I was more sympathetic towards Voces because it portrayed war through the eyes of an innocent boy like I had never seen done before. The comic relief was also well-performed and timely.\n\nTwo great movies that deserve our praise and to be watched by as many people as possible. Frankly, it seems that the people who should be watching it the most, aren\u0027t." }
