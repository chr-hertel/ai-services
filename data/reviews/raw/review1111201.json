I found it hilarious and I think that\u0027s how it really is for teenagers nowadays in rural areas. There just isn\u0027t a whole lot to do and even less if you don\u0027t fit in with the \"in crowd\". ND and his friends are a bit naive and just do the best they can. ND gets frustrated, but jeez, look at his family. He doesn\u0027t have the luxury of just packing up and leaving, like his brother, and he deals with his situation. How he goes about solving problems is funny (like his slogan \"Pedro will protect you\") and I think the underlying message is: don\u0027t give up - keep going. Who would have thought that a movie without cursing, smoking, drinking, drug use, or nudity can be so entertaining. Oh yea, it\u0027s called family entertainment. What a concept.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
