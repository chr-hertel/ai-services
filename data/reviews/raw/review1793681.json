I get scared by almost anything, and I will admit that once I read the plot summary for \u0027One Missed Call\u0027 I was intrigued. My friend and I both thought it had potential. Than I saw the trailer, and was almost as disappointed as I was I saw \u0027The Land Before Time 16\u0027. I went to see this movie expecting it to be comically ridiculous, and I wasn\u0027t disappointed. If you want a good laugh, go see it. If you are frightened by a missed call on your cell phone than you may want to sleep with the lights on, otherwise you should be fine. The worst part about this movie is that it isn\u0027t quite corny enough to be considered entertaining. It simply leaves you constantly turning to the person next to you to say \"What was that?\" because of how childish the plot becomes.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
