Richard Widmark plays a wounded criminal whom the police bring to the hospital along with his brother. When his brother dies, Widmark blames the black doctor, Poitier, in what is apparently his first screen appearance. I can only say, what a debut. In an attempt to get an autopsy that will clear him of any wrongdoing, Poitier and his boss, played by Stephen McNally, appeal to the brother\u0027s ex-wife, Linda Darnell, to talk to Widmark and convince him to consent. When Widmark\u0027s version of the story gets out, the seething community explodes, and a race riot breaks out.\n\nThe liberal use of the N word is a little hard to take in this movie, and the blatancy of Widmark\u0027s hatred and prejudice is shocking. Widmark, who used to help out Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee in their various charity events, gives an astonishing performance as a wounded man both physically and emotionally, a man possessed by hate, rage, and bitterness. Poitier is excellent as a young doctor dealing with race in his profession, though he\u0027s fortunate to have a color-blind boss. It\u0027s interesting to note that a black worker in the hospital intimates that in order to succeed as a resident, Poitier had to take tests the whites didn\u0027t have to, etc. Poitier orders him to knock it off.\n\nAlthough a star from the late \u002730s, Linda Darnell is only 27 in this film. She\u0027s deglamorized but beautiful, and \"No Way Out\" was made at a time when she was getting her best roles. She\u0027s marvelous as a down and out, frightened woman.\n\nAlthough the genre has evolved since \"No Way Out,\" this is a tough, tense, well directed movie that is well worth seeing.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
