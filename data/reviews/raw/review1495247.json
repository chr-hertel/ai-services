Kate has a shower, gets a dress and is invited to have breakfast on the beach with Henry Gale; Sawyer is locked in a cage for wild animals and without food or water, being \"awarded\" when he hits a lever as if he were an animal; and Jack is locked in a sort of aquarium, being interrogated and controlled by Juliet, who has a complete report about his life. Meanwhile, Jack recalls his divorce process with Sarah.\n\nThe beginning of the Third Season is a weird episode focused in the former life of Jack and disclosing some aspects of the life style of \"The Others\". After three months without \"Lost\", I found \"A Tale of Two Cities\" intriguing, and it seems that the story is going to have a big twist, now finally disclosing \"The Others\". Henry Gale increased his importance in the series, since he is one of the leaders, and a new Machiavellian character, Juliet, is introduced. What I like most in \"Lost\" is that I do not guess what may happen in the next episode. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): Not Available\n\nNote: On 3 April 2013, I saw this episode again on DVD (divided in two parts).", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
