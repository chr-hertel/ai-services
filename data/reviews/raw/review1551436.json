It\u0027s definitely high ranking. Script, acting, direction, sets, music  all in a high game. Got that over with. You\u0027ve probably heard that the beginning of the film is a glamorised portrayal of crystal meth addicts. It\u0027s well made, such that it would appeal to people interested in a sort of slow, illegal, decadent experiment with self-destruction. That is to say, it would appeal to plenty of young adults who want to be bad. Nothing wrong with that. In fact I\u0027d say it\u0027s a good thing. Even the ancient Greeks had a structure for allowing that kind of rebellion to happen in a controlled way. This film is part of our current establishment structure for expressing our occasional wishes to reject all authority (even benign authority). So far so good (or should I say bad). Anyway, the plot\u0027s interesting, and Kilmer is good. (I seem to be in the minority that enjoys Kilmer\u0027s low-key acting.) The plot\u0027s even a little noble, if you agree that revenge for massive personal injury is a noble thing. It certainly makes for a great story. It\u0027s maybe even one of the oldest stories. So, if it\u0027s well told, as this one is, it\u0027s gripping, as this one is. For me though this film was annoying on a few fronts. First, so much is made of Kilmer\u0027s character\u0027s tattoo that you have to be the kind of person who romanticizes tattoos to enjoy it. Next, so much was made of the glamorously seedy depiction of the crystal-meth takers in the long intro that you have to romanticise self-destruction by narcotics to enjoy it. You\u0027d have to romanticise it so much that you are willing to buy the suggestion by Kilmer\u0027s character that self-destructing on narcotics brings the self-destructors close in a way that is otherwise unachievable. (I don\u0027t see that it does - I think that\u0027s one of the illusions that recreational drugs help create, and it\u0027s a trap.) But then, we\u0027re on to the big hit of this film - D\u0027Onofrio\u0027s character, and his chronies. He almost steals the film, and to enjoy that, you\u0027ve got to be able to find his portrayal of a psychotic bully amusing. I didn\u0027t. I\u0027m sure director Caruso and his crew know that people like D\u0027Onofrio\u0027s character really exist - people who laugh while slowly killing someone. They can be charming, as D\u0027Onofrio\u0027s character is, but they\u0027re essentially gruesomely evil. I can\u0027t imagine anyone who\u0027s really been at the receiving end of such cruel sadistic violence finding this portrayal funny, as we\u0027re apparently supposed to. Which is where the film most lost ground with me. It\u0027s basically a film I\u0027d warn people against. I don\u0027t think it says much of benefit to anyone. The only redeeming features for me were the naïve and loyal meth-taking friend, Kilmer\u0027s character\u0027s determination, and the title. Oh, and the Texan Asiatic FBI agent, with his so-unlikely compassion and wisdom was fun, cool, but so unlikely.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
