It\u0027s something we rarely see in most t.v. shows these days, except for maybe \"Lost,\" known as character development. I thought the \"Smith\" pilot was very good, because like \"Lost,\" I felt like I was watching a movie instead of a t.v. show. The music, production, acting, editing, \"character development\" and action scenes were well done. I think that a lot of ground got covered in the opening episode. The 2nd episode didn\u0027t quite \"wow!\" me as much as the opener, but it was still engaging nonetheless. I had a problem in the 2nd episode with a place like Venice Beach being so void of people during a beautiful, sunny day, so that a full-on motorcycle chase could take place with no innocent bystanders being harmed. Also, you would think that if the robbers are supposed to keep a low profile after their nearly botched Pittsburgh heist, that Jeff (Simon Baker) would have enough sense to wear a motorcycle helmet (required by law in CA.) in order to avoid hassle with the authorities. But I guess that\u0027s just the daredevil in his character, or perhaps just an oversight on the show\u0027s writers.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
