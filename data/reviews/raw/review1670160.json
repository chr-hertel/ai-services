It was first shown here weekly, in the evenings of 1970 Summer. It was translated and retitled into 11 episodes, totally different to the 2 original films first shown in Europe. I sadly missed a couple of early episodes. The series was terrific, laced and spiced with wit, humour, romance, and excitement. The most interesting and suspenseful scary bits were the doctor\u0027s murder, and towards the end with the old house and coffin, the dark windy night, and Injun Joe in the McDougals\u0027 Caves. It has never been shown on UK TV since it\u0027s final weekly repeat in late 1974, to my knowledge. I never knew at first it was not an American Film! I wish they would show it again here, or release the English Version here on DVD. The music is lovely too. David" }
