Remy McSwain (Dennis Quaid) is a New Orleans cop investigating the seemingly routine death of a wise guy, he is surprised by the amount of interest being shown by the new District Attorney Anne Osborne (Ellen Barkin). McSwain is a cocky fun loving kind of guy and he is soon trying it on with Osborne. She doesn\u0027t resist to hard but soon she realises she must end this relationship as there will be a conflict of interest as she is also investigating corruption in his precinct. Mc Swain is entrapped by an Internal Affairs sting, but when evidence goes missing, Mc Swain is cleared. As the bodies build up in the seemingly escalating gang war, Mc Swain and Osborne finally come together to as real truth is revealed. Decent Neo Noir, that doesn\u0027t take itself too seriously playing a lot scenes for laughs. It also follows the seemingly de-rigeur 80\u0027s phenomenon that all Noirs need to be steamy, although this one doesn\u0027t quite ratchet up the sexiness as much as others of the era. The ending is the low point of the film, its very abrupt and a little to Disney for this crime fan.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
