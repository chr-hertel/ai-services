So I have to say that I only wasted 10 minutes of my life... and how I regret it...\n\ndon\u0027t watch it, is not even worth seeing out of curiosity\n\nIt is sad that the director has no sense at all, and on top of that he comes here to say it is the bes movie ever. I think the director should consider getting another career.\n\ndo not watch this movie\n\nThe director wrote that he reinvented horror genre, yes you did, you invented a whole new category of bad movie making. seriously it was the most stupid movie ever.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
