What is happening?", "reviewBody": "Disney of late has come to a point that I don\u0027t quite get. They release a great film and then spend the next few years making mediocre films and direct to DVD sequels.\n\nUnfortunately this came under mediocre.\n\nI took my children (harsh critics if they get bored) and sat back ready for what I was hoping would be the top draw stuff that Disney is capable of. I didn\u0027t get it.\n\nWhile the premise is a clever one they have done the cross over between alternate worlds before, and done it better.\n\nThe cast themselves were on the whole good, but the best, Sarandon just wasn\u0027t on screen enough. Spall added the comic relief and was value but the rest just seemed to be going through the motions. I know it is a children\u0027s film but they should still be trying to be believable.\n\nThe best of Disney\u0027s recent releases have all come by way of Pixar. They seem to put the time and effort into their scripts and set pieces and they always deliver something that is aimed at children but has enough in to keep the adults entertained as well.\n\nThat is where enchanted failed. I wasn\u0027t entertained and found myself all, too often trying to work out how long the film had left to go so I could go home.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
