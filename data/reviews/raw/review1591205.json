Engelbert Breitfuß, the prime example of an Austrian and especially Viennese clerk, and, as his counterpart, Alfred Dorfer as Michael \"Mike\" Weber \"himself\", and uneducated cad, who happens to work in the same office as Breitfuß.\n\nKarl Ferdinand Kratzl who performs great as Herr Klaus / Santa Clause (YES the beard IS real) and Monica Weinzettl as dense secretary Frau Knackal complete the regular cast of the show.\n\nIn the earlier episodes Karl Markovics and in the later ones Wolfgang Böck make frequent appearances as Senatsrat / Obersenatsrat.\n\nAnother character that appears frequently as well is \"Kopier-Fredi\".\n\nThe rest of the cast of each episode is made up of guest actors, sometimes people who are famous in Austria and Germany like Bavarian actor Ottfried Fischer, Austrian football star (and Rapid Vienna legend) Andy Herzog or other Austrian comedians.\n\nThis show has many great aspects, first of all the phantastic and very Austrian style of humour which made me laugh harder than most things I\u0027ve seen on TV, the hilarious satire of bureaucracy in Austria, which at times, well actually most of the time, is so true, and last but not least the never ending rivalry of two main characters who seem to hate each other so deeply when they are actually so similar below the surface.\n\nThere is nothing really bad i can say about this show, the only thing i should add: If you are not from Austria or at least speak German, you probably can\u0027t do much with it. Even if you are from Germany (or Switzerland) you probably won\u0027t get a few of the jokes. :)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
