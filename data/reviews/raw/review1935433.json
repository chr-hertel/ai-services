This movie could be ten times what it appears with a bigger budget and crew. As with many indie films, you can lose sight of the story and writing quality by the lighting and editing. more money can often solve these issues, even Star Wars would look horrible if on a super small budget. Anyway.... this writer and crew could surely benefit from a bigger budget, maybe a director of photography, assistant director...who knows. Bottom line is, great potential for the creators. Story is worth watching. crew is worth investing in.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
