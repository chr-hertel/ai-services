He wasn\u0027t evil and he didn\u0027t have an agenda to use people. He just wanted to be somebody.\n\nIt\u0027s a lesson in humility and perseverance and ultimately achievement.\n\nIf you only ever see one ROCKY, this is the one to watch. Rocky 2 and 3 are also good. Rocky 4 and 5 - not as good as the others.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
