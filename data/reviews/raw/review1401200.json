It had style but VERY little substance with a forced morality lesson in tow.\n\nI really don\u0027t understand why everyone was so jazzed about this movie. Maybe they were voting based on how well their kids liked it. As an adult, I was personally rather bored.\n\nI only gave it a 5 because of the technical wizardy of the CG.\n\nWell, since I\u0027m forced to put in at least 10 lines, I\u0027ll also say that Ray Romano is talentless and continues to play the same character no matter what he does. He\u0027s even worse than Kevin Costner and Nicolas Cage.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
