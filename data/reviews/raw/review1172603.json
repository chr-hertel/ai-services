Sure its no First Contact, but it is a ST movie Roddenberry would be proud of. It has fantastic acting, good special effects, good action (not too much) and a relatively big surprise towards the end. Sure if u look hard enough you can find plot holes or places where the movie got kinda slow, but as a whole, it told an incredibly thought provoking and emotional tale that even in todays time raises some serious questions about the shades of grey in our rights and wrongs.\n\nWhere this movie lacks is that it feels like it was put together over a month or so. It really could have a little more time to \"tweak\" some of the small problems, nothing too bad though.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
