Although this genre has been worn out and over saturated with terrible films, This film was surprisingly good with an intricate plot and great characters. The film obviously was made on a small budget, but it\u0027s easily overlooked by having a remarkable script. This film explores the Hip Hop Unit that investigates the hip hop industry and its rumored links to organized crime. The film follows a detective and his quest to bring down a certain hip hop mogul. Good direction, great story, do recommend it. I\u0027d like to see what this kid can do with a large budget. Check it out.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
