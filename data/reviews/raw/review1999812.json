Not enough has been said about female director Darnell Martin, who, like Etta James, is a very fair-skinned woman of African descent. It\u0027s likely she can appreciate Etta\u0027s confused position as a mixed-race woman in the mid-20th century. Martin\u0027s foregrounding of the position of the women characters, whose own pain, ambition and insecurity had to take a back seat to the pain, ambition and insecurity of their men, was for me the real core of the picture. Wright and Gabrielle Union, as well as Brody and Beyonce, are at their best when conveying how romantic love is so often frustrated, both by gender and by racial power plays.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
