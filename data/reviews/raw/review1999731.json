There should have been more.\n\nDon\u0027t get me wrong, I don\u0027t want the movie to be longer - I want more jokes. This was a comedy, right? I think jokes are an important part of comedy.\n\nI have seen episodes of Lost with more comedic relief than this movie.\n\nI\u0027ve seen Youtube videos that were better than this.\n\nIt\u0027s hard to believe that such a talented writer as Harold Ramis of Caddyshack and National Lampoon\u0027s Vacation could have hatched this bad egg out of his mindgrapes.\n\nThis would have been a great movie in Fantasyland.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
