This is one movie i did go to see an epic. I excepted something far better than it actually was.\n\nThe good things were the action in the movie was superb. The action did end up being a lot of the film which is why it is a good a movie. The Sandman became a better character than he every was, and he was probable the best character in the movie. Another reason the movie was good, because of venom.\n\nThe bad things are the story is similar to the other ones. The same things happen like always.Other things i didn\u0027t like were the transformation of Peter into an evil version which i thought were kiddish, but it was suppose to appeal to kids so i cant hold it against them. Also, venom only appears for like twenty minutes. And he as a character movie wasn\u0027t the one who shined in it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
