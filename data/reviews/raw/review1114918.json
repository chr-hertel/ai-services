Feeble !!! Shabby !!!", "reviewBody": "SPOILER : I hate to waste any more of my personal time to write a comment for this horrible film. But if this comment is read by any aspiring viewer, shall at least be saved from spending three dreadful hours of his life.\n\nOne of the finest Director of India suddenly presents us his worst offering. Sadly this film is so shocking \u0026 horrific, that I cannot describe my foretasted feelings while leaving the cinema hall.\n\nThe movie revolves around a Drummer \u0026 utterly butterly romantic-girl-flattering-lover boy Shahrukh Khan who doesn\u0027t want to bingle with Karisma Kapoor who inturn is in deep love with the former, while the new girl in their block, Madhuri pulsates for Shahrukh with vice versa fashion, finally to see Akshay kumar\u0027s future love-life flattered by witnessing the twosome\u0027s emotional bond.\n\nSo we have the biggest ludicrous dialog put on air \"Hey, He is just a friend, I never loved him\", \"She is just a friend\", \"I never saw him from love angle\" .............................. CAN A BOY \u0026 A GIRL BE BEST FRIENDS, HEY CAN TWO BEST FRIENDS FALL IN LOVE .................................. STOP IT !!!! STOP IT !!!! for god\u0027s sake this concept sucks.\n\nSo these 3 characters keep revolving round \u0026 round. The script writer must have written the film in less than 3 hours.\n\nPerhaps this Film is the most senseless movie ever made in Indian cinema history.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
