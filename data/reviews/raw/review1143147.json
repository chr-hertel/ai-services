It is funny and looking back on my own experiences in a college singles ward -- very true. Young people going through this time of their life might not enjoy the humor because it is too close for comfort but when they get older they will realize how absolutely funny and true this movie is. I loved it and I think the characters are very believable. Thanks Jonathan Jordan and company for giving my husband and I great, clean humor to enjoy. I loved the cameo appearances by many big name members of the church and the way their comments came into play was delightful. I can\u0027t say enough good things about a movie that makes you smile all the way through.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
