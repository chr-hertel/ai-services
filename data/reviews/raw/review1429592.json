But that part was pretty good, but also they gave it away in the preview so you totally knew it was coming so it was not a truly big huge laugh.\n\nLuke Wilson is hot but that is not a good enough reason to spend your money to watch this.\n\nTerrible movie!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
