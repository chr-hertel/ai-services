I don\u0027t know about Europe or USA, but in Japan there\u0027s a legend about Tapir that they eats man\u0027s dream. I think even those 2001 monkeys(not yet human) had a dream, for instance, a dream of being strong, living safe and easy. \"The civilization\". \n\nI think those Tapirs are ate all of those monkeys \"dream\" all the time, so that\u0027s because those monkeys \"dreams\" didn\u0027t came true, not once. But soon, one monkey grab a tool(weapon), and hit down a Tapir. I think that\u0027s the moment all the things are ready and going to happen, The METAPHOR of beginning of a civilization, a dreams come true. Until then, all of them were just feel small, shriveled up you could see.\n\nI think Kubrick wanted to express the essence of The civilization. In this civilized world, there\u0027s a lots of TOOLS and people who use TOOLS. Civilization is a NIGHTMARE to most of the TOOLs, I mean people. Remember, HAL thinks he has a human\u0027s will. But you know he\u0027s just a TOOL. Boman thinks HAL is just a TOOL as well. But, how about him, captain Boman?" }
