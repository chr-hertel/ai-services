The series is nicely toned down on the paranormal, without going too much that way either. All in all a very balanced out series, with splendid actors, and very good episode scripts. You come to emphasize with Alison and her family. You follow them through ups and down, and just feel that you get to know them. And still there is just the right amount of paranormal things going on, to make it fetching.\n\nThe best thing, i feel, is that although Allison obviously is extremely gifted in the paranormal. She not only reads surface thoughts and communicates with dead people, but even deep dives into minds when it is necessary,she isn\u0027t portrayed as this all-knowing, all powerful \"mutant,lol\" But rather a normal woman, that has been gifted/cursed with these abilities and has to cope as best she can.\n\nIn comparison, Jenifer Lowe Hewit\u0027s Ghost Whisperer, comes of as a much more shallow, two-dimensional person. Ghost Whisperer is just so much more of a light weighter. The plots are weaker and the acting doesn\u0027t even come close. And this comes from a person that actually really like Ghost Whisperer. but Compared to \"Medium\" it is just a pale shadow.\n\nThe only reason I don\u0027t give this one a 10, is that this is a TV Series, not a movie. But compared to other TV Series in this genre it is a sure and certain 10 1/2.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
