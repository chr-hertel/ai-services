Anyone who would give this movie a lousy review should be watching grass grow and giving Lawn Doctor a call. Please do not listen to them and see this movie for its simplicity in telling a simple but profound story about 2 people meeting briefly who change each others lives forever. Perhaps the negative commentators have not experienced any magic in their dull existence or they could not have been so callus in their opinion. Of course, this is only my opinion also. \n\nThat old saying \"Everyone is a critic\" is so real. It is easy to be a critic. All you need is an opinion and someone to listen.... therefore please listen to the positive comments and embrace ONCE for the wonderful message it has to offer.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
