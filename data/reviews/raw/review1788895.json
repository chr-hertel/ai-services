I have a strange history with Blood Feast. I am a horror film junkie and have been since I was a small child. In the 80s, I tried to watch as many VHS horror films at various rental places with my friends. I even came across HG Lewis stuff without realizing it. I know I saw Color Me Blood Red and Wizard of Gore. The covers attracted me, but they were nothing films--time wasters. Never thought much about them.\n\nIn the early 90s, as an adult, my spouse and I found a cheap laser disc player at a thrift store for $5. There was a local place that rented laser discs, and they had a ton of them. I would go in and get movies I had not seen like Salo, but I loved the obscure horror stuff. One day under the B section I found Blood Feast. The cover looked awful, but I had to see it. The clerk tried entering it into the computer, but it was not in the computer. In fact, that meant the item had not been rented in 10 years since that is when they set up the computer system. She was shocked. I though it must have been really bad for a film to go unrented for that period of time. It was like finding treasure. I get home and put it in the player. Our jaws were on the ground. It was an amazing experience, and the blood... We told everyone about this film, but no one had heard of it. Now I am a film teacher, and I have a huge cult film collection. Blood Feast was one of the films that got me so into searching cult films. Yes, I have everything by Lewis, but nothing compares. It is a treasure of cinema.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
