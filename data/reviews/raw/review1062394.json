I\u0027m not gonna be long-winded here, but for those who like German dramas this one for sure is a top 5, a well deserved spot among films like: Der krieger und die keiserin, das weisse rauschen, I\u0027m juli, gegend die wand and so on... Although this is a movie about being young, having ideals and following them, u don\u0027t have to be alike to follow along... this movie will touch everyone, at least if u are one of those who can let that happen\n\nDaniel Br√ºhl....great in this one as well...\n\nAt times like this i praise my German studies :)\n\nthank you!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
