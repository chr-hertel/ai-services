In the late 1940\u0027s and early 1950\u0027s some of Poland\u0027s teenagers were involved in a life and death struggle against the Soviet and Communist Polish authorities. these young people had been raised in the bloodshed of WWII and had learned to fight and die.\n\nThe film shows the lost youth of Poland struggling to find a way to leave this vicious upbringing and return to a normality which they often didn\u0027t ever have.\n\nThe film\u0027s hero wants to return to being a student and having romances and friends after years of fighting for the Polish underground (this is why he wears sunglasses, because his eyesight was damaged fighting in tunnels during the Warsaw Uprising), however he has a mission to kill a communist officer...\n\nThe film is amazing, the imagery reflects the detruction and sorrow of this lost generation. The direction and acting are superb. Like a previous poster, however, I was a little dis-satisfied with the ending, which differed from the book. That is a trivial point, though." }
