Let\u0027s just say I watched it this weekend while taking care of 2 kids which equals numerous interruptions. Overall, pretty balanced. I\u0027m really glad that they explored the destructive side of member\u0027s decisions and behavior, and the price their family and friends paid. I do however, appreciate their passion for trying to stop the war at all personal costs. They were a little delusional and smug in their youth and 70\u0027s styling and \"dig this so you can dug it later\" vernacular (it\u0027s laughable today). PLUS, I found the Weathermen/women so condecending towards anyone not in their socioeconomical situation. Apparently upper hierarchy within did practice elitist behavior (sorry not being pretentious, just realizing I don\u0027t know how to spell it in American English - super-screwed without spell check as you can tell). It did FINALLY click with me why the university I attended took bomb scares seriously, even in the late 80s!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
