Those days are gone obviously. Most people fly the friendly or unfriendly skies. The film shows Marcy, a young woman from Ohio, with aspirations to become one of the best flight attendants anywhere. During her fabulous career, she is courted by three men who all happen to be called Mike. There is Captain Mike Denison, the pilot who she offends as he offers her a lift to the airport on her first day. Then there is Mike Tracy, the science scholar and bartender, and Mike Lawrence, the advertising executive. They are played by some of Hollywood\u0027s leading men like Van Johnson. The supporting cast is equally impressive with Phyllis Kirk. It\u0027s a good film despite the fact that it\u0027s outdated by decades. Of course, there is one scene where Marcy is constantly sexually harassed by two male passengers aboard the flight.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
