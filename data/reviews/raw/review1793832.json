I think my problem is that a good number of people I know really like this film that it built up an unreasonable expectation. Then again I\u0027m not a fan of anything Producer Judd Apatow has put out from his own film Knocked Up, to the films he either wrote or produced Walk Hard, Talladega Nights, Fun With Dick and Jane, Anchorman, Kicking and Screaming. Watching the DVD I found the need to jump to the next chapter a couple of times, not a good sign.
