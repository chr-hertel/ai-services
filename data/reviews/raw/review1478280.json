One-idea script is shot just like a play, with unimaginative camera set-ups and a stodgy, static direction. In the leading role, Glenn Ford is amiable as always--though, once again, hardly spectacular; supporting work from Dean Jones, Red Buttons and Taina Elg is underwhelming. A thankfully forgotten relic of 1950s cinema, and what exactly possessed these talented actors to take part in such banal material is a question which may never get answered. * from ****", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
