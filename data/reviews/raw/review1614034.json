He plays one of the most powerful, controlling and abusive characters I\u0027ve ever seen on screen, yet he\u0027s still very much human.\n\nThere\u0027s something about Gary Lennon\u0027s writing that really helps you understand these characters and the reality they live in, no matter how dysfunctional and messed up they may be.\n\nOverall, .45 is an amazing debut for writer/director Gary Lennon, full of brilliant acting and an enthralling story. Highly recommended!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
