I\u0027d like to gather these thoughts together (without trying to repeat everyone\u0027s comments) by underscoring how evocative this show is in many dimensions.\n\nFor me, it touches on many levels. I grew up in the Philadelphia area and worked downtown for almost 10 years. Seeing the city is as nostalgic for me as some of the cases that go back and illustrate the city as I remember it over several decades back to the 50s.\n\n\"Heartbreaking\" is a term already used by others commenting here. I have to agree. Especially the episodes involving the loss of or harm to children. With grandchildren now, I realize how lucky we were in raising our own children while avoiding the many horrible fates that befall some of our contemporaries. This show redoubles my awareness and proactive efforts to not take my grandchildren\u0027s safety for granted.\n\nAlso already mentioned is the music. As I sit here composing this, I am listening to the closing scene soundtrack to the Nov 27, 2005 \"A Perfect Day\" episode, Donovan\u0027s \"Catch the Wind\". This is the second time Napster has benefited from the moving episodes of Cold Case. The first was the closing scene soundtrack from the \"Wishing\" episode, Israel Kamakawiwo\u0027ole\u0027s \"Somewhere Over The Rainbow.\" I\u0027m amazed at the production staff\u0027s ability to find popular music so keyed to the theme of a given episode.\n\n\"Topical but not preachy\" has also been stated. Another sentiment I agree with but wish to elevate to standing ovation. The writers\u0027, actors\u0027 and directors\u0027 ability to pull this off is worthy of high praise in this era of media mindlessness.\n\nCold Case is not a \"feel good\" show in the sense of leaving the viewer feeling happy. Yet it is in the more meaningful sense of leaving the viewer feeling something. For me that something is having my heartstrings expertly plucked.\n\nHighest praises for Cold Case and all the people who go into making it what it is!" }
