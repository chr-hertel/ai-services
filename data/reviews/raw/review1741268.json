While Marty is back in time he inavertely changes the future which includes him never existing.\n\nNot only is this a nostalgic snapshot of what the 50\u0027s used to be like, its also a vivid juxtaposition of time periods (50\u0027s and 80\u0027s). It has clever and slick references to the differences in the 50\u0027s to the 80\u0027s and how naive people were.\n\nIs this an epic masterpiece? No, but its a big achievement in cinema because it brings a lot of peoples impossible dreams alive. This is probably one of the greatest comedies ever and is definitely Micheal J fox\u0027s best film so far. 9/10 A must see", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
