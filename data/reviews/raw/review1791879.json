For example, there are some sounds that drone all along, while others appear (though subtle), at certain points to support certain shots.\n\nOne can see also several types of pans: some go up and down in a gentle back-forth way. There is diagonal pan. Zooms also go back and forth sometimes.\n\nThe lightning and the composition/disposition of elements in the space is, as usual and obviously, work of a painer/artist. This can be felt even in this crappy room. This is to say: one can make exquisite art already by the simple art of placing the look/view and composing the scene. Then comes the forcelines of the visuals: like digonales, parallels, etc. The light\u0027s degrad√©es and the colours, although without too much research for textures as in big productions, are fine too. This is an artist\u0027s sketch of a sort...\n\nAll this is not calculated but done with inner feeling and this feel gives the David\u0027s touch/feel to it, as with any true artist.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
