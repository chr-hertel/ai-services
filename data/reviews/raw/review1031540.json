It was definitely not what I had expected, and i thought many parts of the film where either unbelievable or far-fetched. However, in retrospect I think that it was an enjoyable experience, and I think it is unfair to criticise it so harshly. I thought Min-sik Choi was excellent, finding him genuinely funny at times as well as disturbing in others, and nobody can seriously doubt his talent after seeing the excellent hallway fight scene. Although there were elements of the film I was unsure about it did keep me entertained, but don\u0027t expect too much from it!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
