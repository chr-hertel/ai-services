Not just with the film but with Quinton Tarantino. To me, he hadn\u0027t directed this movie, he basically ticked the boxes of people expect of him. \n\nNon-Linear story Chapaterised; Classic songs; Interesting dialogue; References to dozens of films from various decades from various genres.\n\nTo be fair to him, he did tick all of them but what he ticked them with was very lame stuff, but the overall product was just plain disappointing. And it seems to me that it has got to a point where Tarantino\u0027s ego has become more important than the script. Ultimately I get the feeling that Tarantino has peeked with Pulp Fiction, but he is deluded in to thinking that is he can deliver that every time. I think that he has lost his \"voice\" in the same way I think Kevin Smith has lost his. The spark/flare in the dialogues that were in his earlier films has gone, what we get instead is stuff which is very laboured. Likewise the use of music in his films, he has used the music so badly in this film it is unbelievable.\n\nI guess the best analogy that I could give is M.Night Shyamalan films, you go watch his films expecting a twist, and when he does deliver the twist, you are kind of left disappointed with it. Likewise you go to watch a QT film expecting the stuff mentioned above, and what you get isn\u0027t what you had hoped.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
