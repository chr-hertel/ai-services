A moving story of a young girls battle to move on from her troubled past, really interesting direction and fantastic performances from Bond and Rieger, produced as part of the New Directors Intiative under Burn Hand Film Productions, this is a very strong debut from actress turned director Charlotte Rayner. Excellent locations and sharp cinematography make the film look beautiful. It gathered quite a bit of local press after preview screenings of the film, bold and provocative Jones and Brennan produce another brave film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
