In 1998 Disney made the Chinese Folktale into a movie. Basically this is imitating the great film into a modern day drama for tween. Miley Cyrus can\u0027t act and has a poor background on the character. The supporting characters have terrible and unsupported feedback to Miley\u0027s character. Somehow when Disney Channel thought that this show was good as Even Stevens, Lizzie McGuire, The Jersey, So Weird, and The Famous Jett Jackson they were wrong. Disney Channel makes terrible investments and this will surely backfire as a result of the declining fans the Miley soon will loose in the future. In conclusion don\u0027t watch this show if you love Billy Ray Cyrus.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
