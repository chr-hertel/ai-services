Loved it. Wished I was an English voice talent in it. The twists and turns in the movies started to make ME think I was losing it. The subtle references to Lambs was great. I hope there is a sequel. This movie is worth buying. Add it to you ANIME collection!!!!!!!!!!! But you MUST rent it. My daughter rented it and she said it was great, that\u0027s why I watched. But you must watch it alone otherwise it won\u0027t be as scary. The saddest part of the movie was the rape scene. When MIMA goes back to her apartment and she\u0027s on her bed crying I couldn\u0027t help but cry with her. all in all, a bizarre movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
