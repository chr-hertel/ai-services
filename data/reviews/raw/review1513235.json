Yeah, I\u0027m in my forties, but I liked the dynamic of it and the \"family feel\" of the characters--they all really genuinely seemed to care for one another. The actors did a superb job of making me believe these were real people. I teach college English, and I am around college students all the time, and I say bravo to this ultra realistic portrayal of college students of the future in space. Maybe if more American screen writers and producers(read money men and women--those who hold the money) saw shows like this, American sci-fi (skiffy) would be more mature, realistic, and overall better!\n\nI definitely loved the crew of the ship ILEA--Anna Chancellor(her big break out was four weddings and a funeral) was INCREDIBLE as the young but wise navigator Mercedes Paige. She interacted well with both the characters of the crew and the students she \"mentored\"\n\nall in all, dynamite cool show--buy it, watch it, you\u0027ll be hooked too!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
