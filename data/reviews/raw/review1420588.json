Those include the overly dramatic public address announcer (boy, that\u0027s even more so since this film came out), rock music blaring out as the contestants do battle, etc.\n\nThe main characters are nicely varied with distinct personalities. Shannon Sossamon, however, was not quite up to leading-lady status and hasn\u0027t had a choice role like this since, either. I would have rather seen her \"assistant\" in this film, or the blacksmith woman, be the lead. Anyway, even though it\u0027s a bit long at 132 minutes, it\u0027s still entertaining most of the way, with some of the funniest bits at the beginning. However, it\u0027s just as much a romance (with Heath Ledger as the male lead) than a comedy.\n\nWhat also is good is the sound and visuals in here: all high-class. The lance hitting an opponent made an interesting sound each time. The surround sound in here was good, too. \n\nIt\u0027s a film most people would like, and I recommend seeing it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
