That being said and all acting aside, this movie is just mind blowing.\n\nThe technique used to capture the surreal surroundings the Baudelaire orphans travel through is one that should be marked and used again. The art designers went back to the days of old(film-making) where painted backdrops, elaborate sets and extensive make-up drove the point.\n\nAn excellent example of what I mean is the scene where the children are left on the train tracks and Count Olaf goes into a store to wait until the kids have been run over. The entire surrounding in the scene, the corn fields, train tracks, skyline, etc. is a painted backdrop. It is simply unbelievable.\n\nAnother example of what I mean is Count Olaf\u0027s house, where the Baudelaire orphans are first sent to live. It is Gothic, run down, and perfect.\n\nBesides the Oscar this movie received for make-up, Rick Heinrichs and Cheryl Carasik truly deserved to win their nomination for best art direction. This aspect is definitely the one that stands out among all others...\n\nThe music was damned good as well...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
