If you are even looking at the comment section, it probably is just to see what other people are saying about it for curiosities sake. You\u0027ve already bought or rented or paid to see DWP. If you are the type that won\u0027t see this movie, then you haven\u0027t looked it up in IMDb and you certainly aren\u0027t going to check the ratings. Tell me I\u0027m wrong.\n\nThe only problem I have with the movie is the level of toleration that the girl has for the queen bee. I mean, I would have gone postal and fixed the situation immediately, of course without eligibility for a raise and all.\n\nAnyway, fun movie, reminds me of the nasty remarks made by the pros who write for IMDb. I liked the display of courage, but felt the \u0027girl gone astray\u0027 aspect wasn\u0027t made for real life. I mean, people fade away, get lost in their jobs. Would friends really get that p.o.\u0027d over a workaholic?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
