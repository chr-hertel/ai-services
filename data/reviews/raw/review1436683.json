I had many ideas in my head about where the director could take it, especially a director working so closely with the author himself. Perhaps I set my standards too high and expected too much. After watching the move twice (just to make sure the first time I wasn\u0027t being overly critical) I have come to the conclusion that it is 98 minutes of Asia Argento. The director. Author of the screenplay. Star of the film.\n\nWhat disappointed me most was the lack of depth given to each of the male characters. Part of what made the book such a good read was the detailed descriptions of each person Jeremiah encounters on his journey. After reading a lot of hype about the film featuring known actors and musicians such as Marilyn Manson, Tim Armstrong, and Michael Pitt I was really looking forward to seeing what they could bring to such multifaceted characters. Unfortunately each of them had no less than 10 minutes of screen time and very little dialogue. Although stylistically interesting the focus was shifted from Jeremiah (in the books) to Sarah (Asia Argento\u0027s character). It was, at best, a loose interpretation of a very compelling book. If you\u0027re interested I would suggest getting the book from a library or book store instead of seeing the movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
