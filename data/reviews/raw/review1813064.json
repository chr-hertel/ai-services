The story lines, actors/actresses, characters, and locations are fantastic.\n\nKyra Sedgwick is not the actress I would have picked for \"Brenda Lee\", and I would like Chief Pope to leave the show permanently, but I enjoy the heck out of Flynn, Provenza, Sanchez, Daniels, and \"Brenda\u0027s right-hand man\" (whose name escapes me at the moment).\n\nI would love to see \"Brenda\u0027s lover\" have a more complete role in the future, as I just love \"Fritzi\". What a hunk!\n\nFlynn and Provenza are my absolute favorites from the cast and I love the repartee the two engage in on every show, especially the first seasons when Provenza made a point of cleaning his desk of anything that was not his (usually something Flynn had put there).", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
