I own all the Bods and have since VHS. I grew up with them. Even the Non-Bond series Never Say Never was a Bond film. OK - Here is the requirement for a Bond film\n\nAmazing action in the opening credits, followed by incredible titles and a killer new theme song to set the mood.\n\nTons of beautiful women and a stretch from the Flemming book but the idea that he may have written a few pages. \n\nIan Flemming really wrote Casino Royale. They promised to be loyal to the book. I have waited to see a real Flemming book dramatized. No hope left. \n\nI like Daniel Craig, not here. No charm. He did run his ass off. No gadgets. If you want to say it is the first movie, then go back. Not forward. If he got there from here, go back. \n\nThe story was written in ten minutes at lunch. No thought. 2006 items in a post WII plot, don\u0027t make it better, made it unwatchable.\n\nI hate to write bad reviews unless they are merited. I bought this movie based on the 10 out of ten star reviews. Somehow the 1 and 2 stars were buried.\n\nIt\u0027s time to say Never Again.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
