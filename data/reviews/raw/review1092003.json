If it were a little bit more \"camp\" in style, it might be funny to watch 20 years later, but it just doesn\u0027t get how ludicrous it is. Even the hoops highlights are mediocre.\n\nWe called it, \"The fish that ate our $3.50 (which was movie admission at the time!).\"", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
