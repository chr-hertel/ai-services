Then comes along the street rowdy class of young men who just make enemies among themselves and show their superiority over one another.\n\nbut anandi teaches them the virtues of humility and respect......... the movie also comes packed with a great song-koi jota jisko ......", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
