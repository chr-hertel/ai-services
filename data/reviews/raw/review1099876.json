It has everything good movie needs, sometimes its disgusting, sometimes its funny. Couldn\u0027t find any errors and the twist in the end caught my by surprise.\n\nThis is one of those movies that you shouldn\u0027t miss. Although it has some very weird scenes the movie is pretty understandable even in one watching. I\u0027ve also seen Old Boy and some actors are in both movies, but the acting was great (I didn\u0027t like Sooni\u0027s acting though, don\u0027t know what was wrong with it, just couldn\u0027t get the idea what that character was all about anyway).\n\nThis is semi-low budget movie but still the special effects were great, and I think that the less CGI the movie has the better. As others have mentioned if you cant stand blood and some very disgusting scenes you shouldn\u0027t watch this but other than that this is a must see.\n\nAnd no, this is\u0027int \u0027sci-fi\u0027 movie really, it has couple sci-fi scenes but thats about it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
