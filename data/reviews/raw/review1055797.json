Recognize the character? It was Vinnie Barberino, all grown up and still a bit sleazy, but still likable, oh yes! \n\nDisappointing were William Hurt and Bob Hoskins, perhaps because their characters were badly written, or they just didn\u0027t care. I kept seeing one of the Baldwins (never can remember which) in the Hurt role so Hurt\u0027s incredible talents weren\u0027t wasted. \n\nAndie McDowell is a sweetie, but not very believable; partly the writing. Character development just wasn\u0027t a big thing in this film. Just watch it for Travolta, sit back and enjoy.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
