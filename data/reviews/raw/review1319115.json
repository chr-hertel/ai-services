Yes, it is old, and yes, some of it is outdated, but it also contains some very nice moments. Despite its antiquity, it does succeed in capturing the pain of a man who is deeply in love with a woman he knows he can never have nor even approach. That may sound silly to some readers today, since we now live in an age where men routinely proposition married women (both on and off screen), but frankly, it works. The film is clearly pre-Code---once the Code was installed, any man glancing at a married woman was depicted as a slimy villain. But real life isn\u0027t lived in such black and white absolutes, and that is why this undeservedly obscure little film holds up yet today." }
