The story is sadly a common one in our history, but the way the subject is handled is both new and accurate. I saw a screening in the company of a number of people who have lived through similar experiences, and the response was overwhelmingly positive, though obviously emotional. It\u0027s a much more real portrayal of the Truth and Reconcilition Commission and it\u0027s inherent problems than Red Dust, and much less influenced by foreign interests than the recent spate of movies about Africa. It\u0027s not an easy one to sit through, but well worth it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
