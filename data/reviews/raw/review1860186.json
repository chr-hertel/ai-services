They are Uwe Boll and Matthew Lillard. With some really talented people in their place this could very well have been a much more enjoyable film.\n\nThe acting is par or above. The effects are well done. And while the story isn\u0027t anything new, it\u0027s still usable for a fantasy movie like this. \n\nSo with different people behind the camera (and at least in one case in front of) this could have been rated 7. As it is now I only give it 5 (barely acceptable and nothing I recommend).", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
