The wonderful story by Stephen H. Foreman does something that was very rare at this time: it made a television magical (whatever happened to this writer?). Butterfly McQueen is a delight to watch (and listen to!) in a role that she was made for. As a kid, I identified a lot with the character of Joanna Peabody, and marveled at the idea of having those seven wishes -- this episode stuck with me for months.\n\nThis is a production that Rod Serling would have been proud of, with both fantastic/supernatural elements and a very important moral message, all presented in a fun, entertaining way. Why \"The Seven Wishes of Joanna Peabody\" hasn\u0027t become a classic on TV and shown regularly, I just don\u0027t understand.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
