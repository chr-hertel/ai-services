To me Chimes at Midnight, with Italian title, Spanish scenery, English and American actors ranks as one of the all time finest renderings of Shakespeare in the cinema. I sold my VHS copy recently only because my VHS player no longer worked but I believe it is an absolute necessity that some enterprising company take this project on as a DVD in its entirety. The opening with Falstaff and his companion talking about the days they had seen (yes they heard \"the chimes at midnight\")through the brothel scene with Prince Hal and the hilarious battle sequence, the soliloquy by Sir John Gielgud as Henry the Fourth and many other scenes evoke a sincere understanding and love of the bard\u0027s creations. The release of two well reviewed books on Shakespeare would give impetus to this DVD release.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
