So I know there is no doctor on Earth like Gregory House, but this doesn\u0027t make watching the show any less enjoyable. Each week, House and his crew of Dr. Watson-like eggheads take on a case that presents serious complications. Yes, House is the medical equivalent of Sherlock Holmes and it is no mistake that he too is addicted to drugs and very antisocial. Some of the best scenes have House simply sitting by himself thinking through the problem of the week. Instead of a pipe, the crippled House plays with his cane. Hugh Laurie is wonderful as the misanthropic House although the rest of the cast is highly generic, less the fault of the supporting players (including Omar Epps and Robert Sean Leonard) than the scripts, I suspect. The show, which has House performing a weekly medical miracle, is probably way too intellectual for the average TV viewer, and I predict its demise by the end of Season Three or Four. On the other hand, I suspect viewership is predominantly female, as most of the males on the show are played as hunks. So one never knows.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
