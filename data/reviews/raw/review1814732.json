A Dynamic Masterpiece!", "reviewBody": "Jackie Gleason dominates this film with just several brief appearances scattered throughout which testifies to his greatness as an artist. Paul Newman is impressive and Piper Laurie is stunningly depressing and debauched in her portrayal of an alcoholic misfit hell-bent on self-destruction. George C. Scott plays Minnesota Fat\u0027s \"banker\" and is terrific as the sleazy underworld magnate who controls, manipulates and ultimately destroys peoples\u0027 lives. This is a brilliant effort although it is morose, dark and depressing. This film justifiably received several nominations for Academy Awards in acting roles (4, I think). Quite impressive. This great film sports one of the finest screenplays ever written. Buy it to own. Sensational Stuff!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
