An American SWAT team along with a beautiful female reporter and her cameraman investigates the island to meet friendly tribes and battle the undead, they must try to survive and must find out what is the cause of these creatures.\n\nIt\u0027s a blatant Italian/Spanish made copycat of \"Dawn of the Dead\" and \"Night of the Living Dead\" with some copied situations and some of the music from \"Dawn of the Dead\" by the band \"Goblin\" with the scores from \"Beyond The Darkness\" and \"Contamination\". Despite some stock footage insertion at some sequences, poor make-up effects, bad if funny dialog and stolen Goblin music this manages to be a fun and laughable zombie flick. Director Bruno Mattei has made a movie that manages to combine both a cannibal jungle themed flick and zombie themed flick together in movie that entertains the viewers, there is some good gore effects in this movie like some literally eye-popping exploding heads with flesh-eating for example, hilarious acting and like any Italian cannibal flick there is one scene of animal killing which involves a large lizard getting it\u0027s innards ripped out.\n\nThe viewer will like that lovable sex crazed SWAT team member who always wants the right girl and there\u0027s a funny scene where one of them does his impression of Fred Astair, this should be watched if your into Mystery Science Theater 3000 ( this movie makes a good home MST3K game) and cheesy horror.\n\nAlso recommended: \"Nightmare City\" ( a.ka.
