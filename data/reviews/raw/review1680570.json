Most of the movie consists of a bunch of guys shooting each other through car windows while driving on an open field. No real plot to this movie, and even the action is pretty dull. I wouldn\u0027t suggest this to anyone.\n\nThe dialogue is witless and predictable. There is almost no character development whatsoever-- all we learn about Max is that he\u0027s married and that he\u0027s a cop.\n\nThis movie doesn\u0027t fail because of Gibson\u0027s acting, which is generally up to par. Rather, the lines and overall story he\u0027s provided with are what make this movie awful.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
