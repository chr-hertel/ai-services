This film was sitting on the shelf for a couple of years before Lion\u0027s Gate released it theatrically. A homage of sorts to Zombie\u0027s favorite genre, southern fried horror. Throw in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, add a little Eaten Alive and a dash of FunHouse and you\u0027ll get the flavor of this film. \n\nFour twenty somethings are riding along the back southern roads when they come across a roadside carnival run by an eccentric clown named Captain Spaulding. He gives them a personnel tour of his fun house of horrors and tells them the tale of a local ghoul named Doctor Satan. Inspired by phantasmagorical tale of the good doctor, they decide to search for his grave. Captain Spaulding draws them a map and gives them directions to an area where the Doctor allegedly died. On the road, they meet a pretty blond hitch-hiker who also knows about the legend of Doctor Satan...and a little more! What happens next? You\u0027ll have to visit House of 1,000 Corpses!\n\nA great film that does what it sets out to do. I\u0027m so glad to see old school grind house horror is back in the mainstream. A sequel is out and it\u0027s even better! I have to strongly recommend this movie. You won\u0027t regret it!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
