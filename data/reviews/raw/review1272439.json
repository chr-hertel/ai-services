The cast is excellent, and i agree with critics that she has rarely been better. Her acting is flawless and is comparable with her performance in The Hours, Dogville, Moulin Rouge and so on. Her emotional and captivating performance drives us to empathize with someone in that position. The content is at times so confronting it implores the audience to simply turn away, but we don\u0027t (which is also interesting) we watch on, this drives our understanding even though the meaning is so intense. The techniques that this director has employed such as extended close ups, and a plot of simplicity allows us to just follow the story day to day and allow the responder to gain emotional connections and ascertain personal meaning from this brilliant piece of cinematography. This movie is defiantly worth viewing and is an ABSOLUTE must for Kidman fans.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
