The language of the film, the theatrical dialog delivery, and the baroque music score hark back to the Age of Chivalry, but the characters wear jeans and refer to modern-day inventions in their conversation (to very funny effect, I must add). Damsels in distress, dashing knights, an evil child-devouring ogre and his kindly wife, two children in danger of becoming the ogre\u0027s dinner--the film had them all, with nary a trace of special effects. It relied on good old-fashioned story telling, wit, imagination, and the suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer. A must-see." }
