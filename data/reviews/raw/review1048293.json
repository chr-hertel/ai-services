It\u0027s the story of a guy who gets hypnotised and develops precognitive psychic abilities which he can\u0027t control.\n\nKevin Bacon is excellent and shows he can be a leading man, while the rest of the cast performs well. Sets, special effects and cinematography are all very good - nothing flashy but solid. \n\nIt has shocks and suspense, especially in the first half, and although it could be accused of being a little clich√©d, it never strays too far into the \u0027seen it all before\u0027 category. \n\nThe second half of the film turns into a more traditional thriller but still holds up well, unlike similarly themed movies such as \u0027What Lies Beneath.\u0027 This is because it is pleasingly short, lasting around 90 minutes (the correct length for a film of this type). There are some plot strands that aren\u0027t explained, but this can be forgiven because of the film\u0027s running time.\n\nAlthough not mind blowing, it has a decent payoff at the end and left me satisfied that I\u0027d just watched a good movie. Not a great one, but a good one. Pick this one up cheap on DVD.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
