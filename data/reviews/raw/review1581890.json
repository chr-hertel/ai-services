It\u0027s a top notch cast. Honestly, whoever produced and edited this movie is to blame if it\u0027s not more popular. Obviously the actors must have seen something good in the script for all of them to accept their parts they played. To me, this movie was not a disappointment as others have commented. It\u0027s silly, yes. Goofy, yeah. To me, if it was produced a bit better, and the editing done a bit better I would have definitely given it at least a 7 out of 10. I watched this movie mostly because I just adore Ron Livingston. Even playing a straight-man character he\u0027s very funny. I hope this gets released in the U.S. at least on DVD because with it\u0027s cast it is well worth the watch.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
