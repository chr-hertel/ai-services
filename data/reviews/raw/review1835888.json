Devil\u0027s Rejects is an amazing sequel because it concludes the story, but it is such a drastic, different, satisfying counter-perspective. In House 1K Rob Zombie glorifies the killers. In Devil\u0027s Rejects, as the title implies, he punishes them, and presents them as sinful martyrs... the two films balance each other so perfectly. But since Devil\u0027s Rejects isn\u0027t really horror, House 1K is one of my top 3 movies along with Clockwork Orange and Apocalypse now. Yeah, I\u0027ll rank it that high.\n\nI saw it in a fancy theater when I was 16 after hotboxing a car with California\u0027s finest green chronic, and it was an awesome experience. I was spooked. \n\nThe characters are brilliant.... Captain Spaulding, Otis, Mother Firefly, Baby, they all just ooze personality. The victims are also brilliantly realized, they are shown to have such shallow personas and exaggerrated in their manufactured, \"mickey mouse donald duck socks\", empty identities which is such an important, striking commentary on todays college youth. They look like people who deserve to be killed, we don\u0027t develop any compassion for them and they are perfect lambs for the slaughter. This movie has a message, but it doesn\u0027t get pretentious or overwrought about it. It\u0027s more focused on having some pure unadulterated fun, and through the awesome visceral punch of its audiovisual assault -- awesome music to go along with vibrant images that grab you by the throat -- it succeeds brilliantly.\n\nI will always love this movie and place it on the pedestal of my favorite horror films... while it is derivative (as every great work of art is) it pushes the envelope and I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll ever see another modern horror movie that could outshine this one.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
