If you HATE Andrew Lloyd Webber then you will probably not like this film. Sure, it is melodramatic and over-the-top . . . and that\u0027s why I liked it. Joel Schumacher, who I usually think should be kept as far away from a movie camera as humanly possible, seems to understand that there is no way that this story could be adapted to the screen without opulence, and he does a good job.\n\nThe acting is generally pretty good. Minnie Driver is great as La Carlotta. A Prima Donna in her prime. Patrick Wilson does the best that he can with Raoul, a rather bland character if you ask me. Emmy Rossum has a wonderful singing voice, but she tends to play Christine with only one facial expression.\n\nGerard Butler plays the Phantom, and while many have criticized his singing, I found that it really worked for the film. It might seem weird to say this, but it seemed more realistic and emotional . . . and it had a nice edge to it. Another thing that he was criticized for - although I can\u0027t understand why - is that he is too good looking. Now, if this was a film being adapted from the Gaston Leroux novel then yes, the Phantom being attractive would be a very bad thing, but this is Andrew Lloyd Webber\u0027s The Phantom of the Opera (says so right in the title) and his stage musical has always given the Phantom a bit of a sexual side so really it was cast very well. I will say that it does make the love triangle kind of hard to believe because the Phantom is SO attractive and Raoul is, well, not so much . . . but that is just my opinion.\n\nSo, yes, this film has it\u0027s cheesy moments (count the number of dramatic cape swishes!) but it really needs to be over-the-top because the musical on which it is based is as well. But it is an enjoyable film. The costumes and set are wonderful to watch and the Gothic atmosphere is great. Fun story, good acting, good singing, nice visuals . . . entertaining film!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
