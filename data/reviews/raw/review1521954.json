I laughed at the witty, self-humorous dialogue, jiggled in my seat alongside the Bollywood songs, and drooled at the sight of all that delicious food. This is a rare gem which entertains the majority and identifies with the minority. You\u0027ll end up rushing to your nearest Curry House and checking out the chef! Here\u0027s one funny girl loves girl story which doesn\u0027t end in tears for a change. It can and does happen! Thank you Pratibha! Hope we don\u0027t have to wait another 7 years for the next one.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
