At the end we never had a connection with the mysterious painter, neither I had a clear understanding about the arrangement of clues that the girl finds. The mime, first attractive, does not have time to express his mysteriousness. The girl is beautiful, maybe thats the only thing that kept me watching the film. The mystery of the time when the painting were made is not well developed, I just got impressed by the paintings and wanted to know more about them, but you wont get details, and the love plot of the painter never gets clear.
