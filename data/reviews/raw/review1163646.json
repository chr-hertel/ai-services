It\u0027s a surprisingly entertaining movie that delivers plenty of enjoyable escapism. Dolph Lundgren as He-man was a fun casting choice. He certainly looks the part! My favorite part of the movie is the evil Skeletor. He\u0027s awesome! Frank Langella was a perfect choice! He\u0027s extremely enjoyably EVIL in every scene he\u0027s in! It\u0027s great stuff! Like He-Man? Give this flick a try. Pick up the new \"Best Of\" Masters of the Universe animated DVD too. You can\u0027t beat the fun of He-Man on DVD if you \"get\" this sort of thing. I\u0027ve had a blast watching the movie and the cartoon. Good fun!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
