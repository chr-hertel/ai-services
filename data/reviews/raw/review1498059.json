The couples of the writer and the maid \u0026 the two little kids is realistic and sweet. The president\u0027s love is unnatural although it\u0027s cute. The two porn actor and actress\u0027s is just so gross. Unnecessary porn. They shouldn\u0027t be there. And the ugly guy went to the U.S. and just get 3 beautiful girl on his arrival. What has the U.S. become? A third country supplying \"hen\"? The movie itself is too long because of these flaws. It deserve a 5 up to this point.\n\nNow its OST and the action of the casts save the day. The song is excellent and well-fit with the movie. Billy Mack win Love Actually two additional points for the old singer character. The extraordinary effort of the cast save the awful script and win the rest one point.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
