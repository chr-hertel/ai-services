I loved it and he is know one of my new heroes :D how can you not like the segments of the show? they are odd, yes, but because of that, it makes it interesting and I love how he delivers jokes and he thinks of his own ideas. He\u0027s kind of like Chris Farley as a child, with weirder thoughts. and slightly crazier.\n\nso yep, give it a second chance. it\u0027s fabulous.\n\nmy friend wants to say something: The Andy Milonakis show is PURE genius. If you don\u0027t think so, you deserve to have your eyeballs scooped out with a rusty melon baller. have a nice day :)." }
