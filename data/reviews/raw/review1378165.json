An outlaw on the run, Randolph Scott, finds Jagger and is ready to steal his horse, but changes his mind and brings Jagger to help. Later on he\u0027s hired by Western Union and works for Jagger.\n\nJagger also hires a young easterner played by Robert Young who\u0027s an engineer. Young is doing one of his few loan out films away from MGM for 20th Century Fox. Both Young and Scott become friends, but rivals for Jagger\u0027s sister Virginia Gilmore.\n\nWestern Union has plenty of action, enough to satisfy any western fans. The telegraph crew has to deal with outlaws, Indians, and your garden variety labor troubles.\n\nSlim Summerville as the timid cook and Victor Killian as the frontier character assigned to guard him have some of the funniest scenes. They both provide some good comic relief. \n\nFritz Lang got good performances from his cast and kept the film moving briskly along. Western Union is solid western entertainment.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
