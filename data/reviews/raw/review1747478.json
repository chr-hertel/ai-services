When diplomacy fails (or is neglected), it\u0027s time to fight. And as mathematics has proved, it\u0027s always helpful to have God on your side. All you need now is an over-sized cowboy hat and a jumbo pistol. Watch it.\n\nThe big strength in Learn Self Defense is in its simple character illustration and minimal animation. Everything from movement to color to sound has been minimized to focus your concentration on the tiniest change.\n\nChris Harding is a very talented animator who doesn\u0027t take himself too seriously. He is cautiously documenting his secret Mystery Work In Progress (working title) for all to follow.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
