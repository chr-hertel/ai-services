I think it says a lot about the film industry it says you don\u0027t need anything to make a movie put in some actors a vague idea of a script and you have art, it\u0027s abstract film! if you don\u0027t believe me see it yourself because in this world, this is a masterpiece of 07 cinema a triumph of style! this may very well be the best film ever. name one problem with this film i\u0027ll argue well. so in general if you don\u0027t watch this movie you\u0027ll miss out on a lot. it\u0027s like taking gold and making it more shiny, it\u0027s utter perfection.\n\njust joking, avoid this piece of crap at all costs! now here is why: bad plot, bad acting bad, everything else so, in general this IS the worst of the worst", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
