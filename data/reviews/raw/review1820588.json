Sure enough, it\u0027s been almost twenty years now and my perceptions may be a bit off, but reading some of the other comments, perhaps not. There\u0027s just something deeply unsettling about the whole movie, not to mention the ending, which will probably remain etched into my brain for the rest of my life. Makes me uncomfortable just thinking about it. Together with \"Jaws\" and \"Gremlins\", this is one of the films my parents shouldn\u0027t have let me watched. Anyway, there are so many movies today that are worth watching and probably better than this, but I\u0027d still recommend it for a boring Sunday afternoon.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
