Biehn is superb.", "reviewBody": "The Ride is a very different kind of film that was never designed to break box office figures but rather convey a message. With strong religious themes throughout, the film is very much down to interpretation. As an atheist, I was angered at how Danny (Brock Pierce) appeared to be forcing Smokey (Michael Biehn) in to religion. This is how I saw it but it is entirely possible that Danny was simply trying to open Smokey\u0027s mind. Smokey\u0027s inevitable conversion to Christianity, whilst infuriating to me, was handled very well by Biehn.\n\nWhere the film flourishes is in the opposing sides to Smokey\u0027s character. On one hand he is a selfish drunk but also he is compassionate and cares deeply for Danny and Linette. Whilst not always reacting the best way to situations, Smokey knows what\u0027s right and eventually comes through. The relationship between Smokey and Danny is also very touching. Whilst not agreeing with Danny\u0027s behaviour, he displays great courage and a purely platonic love for the entire world. The bonds between the characters are visibly, very strong and you can\u0027t help but feel great empathy all the way through the film.\n\nThe main reason to watch this film is Michael Biehn. Whilst he should be in much better films than this, Biehn takes his role very seriously and gives one of his strongest performances in a very long time. Biehn walks a fine line between arrogance and charisma as he did in K2 and it is very convincing that he makes friends and enemies in equal measure. It is a very demanding role as Smokey Banks is a very complex character and Biehn as always exceeds all requirements.\n\nReligion is still very much a taboo subject and whilst I myself am not Christian, I admire the film maker\u0027s courage in showing his beliefs. The major axe I have to grind with this film is the culture it portrays. I hate bull rodeos as they are immensely cruel and the whole cowboy way of life theme becomes a tad tiresome. The \u0027hicksville\u0027 ranch that Banks is staying at is so stereotyped that you can picture George W. Bush being extremely happy there.\n\nThe Ride is fantastic once you look through the cheesy themes as it touches the emotions with great power. It is the inner core of the film that remains in the mind after watching, making The Ride well worth watching.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
