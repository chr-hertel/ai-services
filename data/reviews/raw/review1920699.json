The ship is named Dave Ming Cheng, and has the likeness of its Captain (Eddie Murphy). The aliens experience what it\u0027s like to be human, and complications ensue when the ship takes a fancy to Gina Morrison, a beautiful Earthling (Elizabeth Banks) and her son, much to the chagrin of No. 3, the ship\u0027s Cultural Officer (Gabrielle Union).\n\nThe whole miniature deal was still too reminiscent of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, and they didn\u0027t exactly do anything new with it. The flick just coasts along, but there are a few laughs to be had if you can get through the cheese factor. As an alternative, you can just play \u0027Where Was He on Again?\u0027 (aka Spot the TV star).\n\nYes, Meet Dave relied on a gaggle of stars from the boob-tube to liven up the trite comedy with Ed Helms (The Office) as the scheming, uptight No. 2, the ship\u0027s 2nd-In-Command, Judah Friedlander (30 Rock) as the ship Engineer, Mike O\u0027Malley (My Name is Earl; Yes, Dear) as the useless Officer Knox, and the hunky Marc Blucas (Riley in Buffy) as Gina\u0027s puppy-eyed neighbor Mark Rhodes. But it was Pat Kilbane (Mad TV, Seinfeld, Spin City) who plays No. 4, the ship\u0027s Security Officer, who elicited the most laughs with his uncannily crazy timing and physical comedy.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
