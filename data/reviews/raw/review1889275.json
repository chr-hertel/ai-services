You also get to see the amazing shot of having TV\u0027s coolest car get packed to it\u0027s absolute capacity as Tod and two girls ride up front, while the other three sit in back and Linc rides on top of the trunk facing backwards. There is also a fun appearance by Al Lewis and even a music score that isn\u0027t half bad.\n\nThere is no penetrating character study here no any deep dark revelations, but it is just as good and a nice \u0027breather\u0027 from the series more heavier episodes. The characters all seem very natural and real, people you wouldn\u0027t mind getting to know. They are also attractive although the one I found most attractive, Susan Ringwood, unfortunately never appeared in anything else.\n\nGrade: A", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
