An absolutely stupid choice of lead actor combined with a really bad script makes the whole thing kind of \"Killer Tomatoes\" cool.\n\nThis kind of thing happens in the story: They go into some underground tunnels beneath a graveyard with no plan, no guns, no secret charm, just Don Knotts and Mr. French going to see if the monster that killed 4 people last night is still there. They find this crazed demon-infested girl and reach near it\u0027s hugely-fanged face to pull out a hair to study. Just one dumb idea after another.\n\nMy favorite part? Check out the sound it makes when the deputies are shooting the lock at the end.\n\nI didn\u0027t see the first movie, but I don\u0027t think I needed it to review this.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
