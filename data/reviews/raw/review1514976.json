THe OH in OHIO tells about a married couple and the wife\u0027s inability to have an \"orgasm\"...This causes a rift between the couple as the wife tries to find various ways to pleasure herself.Meanwhile,the husband played by Paul Rudd has an affair with his seductive student played by Mischa Barton.\n\nThis movie has a lot of comedic moments mostly involving Parker Posey and her quest for her sexual desires.Paul Rudd fits in nicely as the frustrated husband who just cant give his wife an orgasm.Mischa Barton had a rather small role but it was cool to see her in the big screen.Danny Devito was rather disappointing.This is not his best work and one fells that he should have more depth to his role.The show stealer,Parker Posey,does an amazing job as the successful wife who just considers sex with her husband as a\"chore\" and goes on to find out the joy of sex.The ending of the film is pretty abrupt but in a way,it fitted in well with the film.\n\nOverall,The OH in Ohio is a funny little flick where audiences are bound to enjoy themselves and have a fun time.Worth a watch!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
