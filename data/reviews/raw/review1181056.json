In the \u002780s I managed to get a copy on VHS and practically wore it out with re-plays; it\u0027s one of those miraculous little films you can go back to again and again, one that retains its charm and its ability to make you laugh no matter how many times you\u0027ve seen it. If anything, I enjoy it even more as a grown-up, having come to appreciate the inside jokes about Hollywood, cartoon producer Leon Schlesinger, and the legendary \"Termite Terrace\" facility, seen here at the height of its glory days.\n\nIt\u0027s clear from the opening shot that this is no ordinary cartoon; in fact, it\u0027s primarily a live action short filmed on the Warner Brothers lot, featuring actors playing studio personnel. (Amusingly, almost every person we see aside from Schlesinger has his voice dubbed by Mel Blanc, which is not only a great inside joke but makes the humans come off like cartoon characters themselves.) After the animators have gone to lunch Porky Pig comes to life on his drawing board, just like Max Fleischer\u0027s Koko the Clown did in the \u002720s, and so does Daffy Duck, who initially addresses Porky from a portrait on the wall. Daffy urges his colleague to quit cartoons and go for a job in features playing opposite Bette Davis. Pushed by Daffy, Porky quits, and his confrontation with the boss makes for a memorable and oddly poignant scene. Schlesinger, an affable-seeming guy who looks a little uncomfortable playing himself, agrees to release him from his contract. After Porky\u0027s gone, however, the producer turns to the camera and addresses us with hard-bitten wisdom: \"He\u0027ll be back!\"\n\nPredictably enough, Porky\u0027s venture into the real world of studio system film-making is a disaster. He is belittled and chased by a hostile security guard, sneaks onto a sound stage but ruins a take, and when he tries to flee he blunders into a Western set and is pursued by stampeding horses (a great effect, and a comic high point). Daffy, meanwhile, has been trying to hassle a visibly irritated Schlesinger into giving him Porky\u0027s former position. Porky returns to Termite Terrace in the nick of time, gets his old job back, and rewards Daffy with a vigorous beating. Thus, order is restored.\n\nAs a kid I didn\u0027t catch all the references to Errol Flynn, Frank McHugh, or Greta Garbo, although I certainly got the joke when Porky tries to sneak into the studio disguised as Oliver Hardy. Still, viewers don\u0027t have to be hardcore film buffs to appreciate the comedy. The animated elements in You Ought To Be in Pictures have a fascinating look, achieved by laying down cell artwork (representing Daffy, Porky, and Porky\u0027s car) on still photographs of the office, the studio, and other \"real world\" locations. This is inter-cut with live action scenes, but on several occasions the cartoon characters interact with the human ones, as when Porky shakes hands with Schlesinger, or, later, drives like a maniac through midtown traffic. There\u0027s an especially startling bit when the studio guard hoists Porky and his car into the air and flings them off the lot These effects may look rudimentary by today\u0027s standards, but they pack more humor and pizazz into each frame than a lot of the technically adept but soulless CGI work produced nowadays.\n\nThis is a great piece of work, and if you\u0027re a movie buff with a fondness for old time Hollywood it\u0027s guaranteed to make you happy.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
