Yeah, why the hell not? This one follows in the footsteps of \"Scream\" and is just pretty much the same movie, only not as good and with a former horror icon in it. Kevin Williamson even has some kind of co-assistant-producer credit. I don\u0027t really think the script is that good, so beats me why Jamie Lee Curtis was keen on returning, but she\u0027s there, good. One thing I don\u0027t get though, if we\u0027re supposed to assume that part 4 never happened, shouldn\u0027t we get another explanation to why Michael is still alive after being blown up? We actually saw his corpse burning through the credits of that second one. I did really like how his without a doubt massive burn wounds had completely disappeared when he revealed himself in part 5, but we\u0027re drifting off. This sequel really isn\u0027t bad, the action is decent, but it\u0027s pretty toothless and has a very low body count. That\u0027s not the most important thing in every horror movie, but it is when it has little else going for it. They did wrap it up in a cool way, but yet another sequel ruined that. Small bonus because a guy gets a skate through the face, which is just cool.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
