What they don\u0027t know, however, is that they\u0027re both assassins, secretly hopping the world and killing for hire. But their separate lives are about to collide when each finds out their next target is their own spouse.\n\nThis is a very entertaining fun film from the very beginning to the end. It\u0027s pure excitement and fun. There are great action scenes, funny comedic scenes, and sweet emotional scenes. The dialog is well written with some witty one liners.\n\nIt\u0027s an entertaining popcorn movie. The CGI is well done within the action scenes. It looks like Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are having a good time making this film that we also enjoy it as much as they did making it. The chemistry by those two are great as well with their acting.\n\nIf you would like to be entertained in a movie with great action scenes and great dialog, this is the film. It\u0027s just a fun film, although not anything great or Oscar material.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
