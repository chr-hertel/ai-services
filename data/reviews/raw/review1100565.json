Kevin is even worse, a third-rate gigolo who can barely put a sentence together! Her bodyguard fears that she will be taken advantage of by this \"punk,\" but why does he care? Lord knows he can find another narcissistic, empty-headed twit to get coffee for!\n\nI was hoping to find out what it\u0027s like to be an A-List celebrity. Aside from pointing out photographers outside her hotel, Britney putts around her suit, bitches about its decor, smokes, runs a treadmill, quizzes her minions on how they like to have sex, and shoves her camcorder in Boy Toy\u0027s face. We don\u0027t get any sense of what it\u0027s like to be on tour, but Britney complains that the person who scheduled hers \"must have been out of his mind,\" as if she is some hapless pawn who has no control over her life. Boo Hoo!" }
