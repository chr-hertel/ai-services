Awful. Did I say it was awful?", "reviewBody": "Urgh. I got to watch this on the basis that Eric Schweig was in it. Let me tell you first that you see him for maybe 3 and a half minutes, so this is blatant false advertising.\n\nI am kind of fond of bad cheesy horror, but this is not a funny bad movie. It\u0027s unfunny painful and boring. It\u0027s unfunny silly. It\u0027s unfunny badly acted. The beast sucks. I didn\u0027t even laugh.\n\nStay well clear, please! There are much better bad horrors out there, many many many more. Don\u0027t get conned by the fact that Eric Schweig is listed ....you\u0027ll barely see him (thankfully in a way).\n\n3/10, because 1 and 2 star are reserved for real low-rated gems. This is too insignificant to deserve such.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
