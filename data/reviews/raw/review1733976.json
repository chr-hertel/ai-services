Nobody in both theaters was under 50. The younger moviegoers all went to see one or the other blockbusters playing in the same complex.\n\nYeah, five years into the war with thousands of dead soldiers and many many more maimed and mentally disturbed for the rest of their lives, people still do not care. They want to be entertained with less disturbing movies.\n\nI do not know much about the military. But I had a father who was forced to participate in the first WW at the age of 18 and he was the most pacifist man I have ever met. I am sure, that what he experienced in this war formed him for life, though he never talked about it. I read books about that war and looked at the movie \"Nothing new on the Western Front\" to understand him better and what he had to endure at that tender age.\n\nNobody really was much aware of post traumatic stress syndrome in those days, though there were plenty of men coming back, who could not cope with what they had done in the war, or what had been done to them.\n\nThe department of war (the name department of defense is a joke, all what they do is initiating one war after the other) educates young soldiers to be killing machines and of course once back from the war, they cannot stop. Because once killing becomes a daily job, human life soon seems disposable and the lines in-between friend and foe become blurred... \n\nAnd you cannot blame the soldiers; we have to blame us, our society. We are not a civilized, nor are we a Christian society; we are as barbarian as our ancestors were who clubbed each other over the head. \n\nI saw the documentary after-wards and I looked in horror at the smiling faces of Rumsfeld, Cheney and Bush when they joked about the quagmire, they created. \n\nWhat kind of humans are we that we allow these old rich men to kill and destroy these young soldiers for the sake of making Halliburton wealthy? What do people think? Who is going to pay the trillions this war costs? YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN. Why is there a whole country asleep at the wheel, instead of all running out and raising the upside down flag? It is about time to realize that things are really in distress in this country. Let us Get off our Ipods, cellphones and the Internet and let us take charge of our future. . \n\nI liked \"Crash\" very much and I was very impressed with this movie too. The acting was outstanding , the cast superb. I always appreciate if a director makes the actors and the location look realistic. I could relate to every second in the movie. I like movies with a message and if they are as well made and entertaining as this one, people should give it a try instead of watching some idiotic Halloween movie. In the Valley of Elah is much more scary!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
