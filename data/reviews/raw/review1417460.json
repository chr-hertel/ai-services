Ray Liotta also does a great job, although I wouldn\u0027t recommend seeing this right after seeing \"Something Wild\", as Liotta does a fantastic job in that movie playing a vicious, ruthless guy. Burt Lancaster is great as well, as Doctor Graham. James Earl Jones is excellent, as always.\n\nThis movies is a must see for anyone whoever played catch with their father!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
