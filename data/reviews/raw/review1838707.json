Once his wife dies he learns that even after death her brain still has these pulses so he tries to contact her. Decent, if not overwhelming, horror thriller features a good performance from Karloff but that\u0027s about it. The supporting cast is rather dull and the middle of the film really drags down, which isn\u0027t good when you consider the film is only 65-minutes. Worth watching if you\u0027re a fan of Karloff but not worthy of $20." }
