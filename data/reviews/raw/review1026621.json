The movie fails on many fronts, including the main character that is the most underdeveloped character in the film and the script that lacks any sense what so ever. The direction is a joke and the visual effects are flat horrible. Some of the acting is good with Rachel Weisz doing what she can with the bad script she has to work with and she almost succeeds because she gives the movie its only real and compelling performance. Too bad the script really focuses on the lousy lead character instead of her and that\u0027s where the movies biggest problem is. You don\u0027t really give a damn about the main character at all and you really don\u0027t give a damn about his kid sidekick, who is just the most annoying character in the entire film.\n\nI don\u0027t know what went though the minds of the people who made this film but if there is a special part in hell for the director and the screenwriters of this movie, I hope they go there quick for what they did to such a great comic book.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
