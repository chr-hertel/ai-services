I HATE my girlfriend for making me watch it .... We have agreed that she owes me an hour and a half of my life back .... I have never left a cinema feeling so baffled before... This movie was crap, and at least if it had given me two hours worth of crap for my money... not even ... short, unfunny, worthless piece of crap movie...\n\nOn the good side ... I laughed three times in the movie ... one of them when there was a parallel made with Mr. Bush on 9/11 morning...\n\nBut still... Big Momma\u0027s House 1 and 2 are masterpieces compared to this !!\n\nPlease save your money ... and don\u0027t go.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
