First of all, the opening speech is supposed to enlighten us to the comprehensive mythological aspects of Egyptian culture whilst introducing us to the fictional story wound into those aspects to form some sort of a plot. All we get from this is drivel! The mythology they base this on is changed completely to suit \"the story\".\n\nOK at least Casper Van Dien attempts his best with the shoddy script and frivolous dialogue but he too fails to conjure up any sort of character traits since character development is obviously overlooked in the script. There\u0027s so much wrong with the script I\u0027m not even going to go any further than this! The directing is atrocious as is the editing, the only way i can describe it is by means of a films pace. This has none! I\u0027m not even going to waste my time continuing with this \"review\" as it clearly isn\u0027t one, more so, id like to call it a warning to anyone who is ever looking to watch this.... DON\u0027T! The curse of King tut makes the likes of \"The Mummy\" or even \"The Scorpion King\" masterpieces!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
