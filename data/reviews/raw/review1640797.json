It has a brilliant plot and a wonderful cast. For instance in this film Ryan Gosling displays his brilliant acting chops. Gosling along with Hopkins make a brilliant match. Their characters go one-on-one with each other in this cat and mouse game. I enjoyed the dialogue between Gosling and Hopkins.The script was well-written for this film. I also enjoyed all of the other performances in the film. With supporting actors like Rosamund Pike and David Strathairn it is easy to see why this is such a great movie. This is one role that I immensely enjoyed seeing Hopkins in. I would gladly see this film again.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
