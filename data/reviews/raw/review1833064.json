A relationship develops, and Cole decides to take it to the next level.\n\nNot only does he have an affair, he fakes his death to escape his family obligations. Lies become increasingly more of a pattern as he begins to rob banks to keep his new wife (Sillas) happy, and to project the image that he is a success. A fictional delusion, apparently.\n\nThis was also based on a true story which makes it all the more intriguing. Cole is believable and excellent in these roles. Recommended. 8/10.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
