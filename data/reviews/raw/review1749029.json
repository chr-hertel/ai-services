She has thought of everything, even how to make herself \"invisible\" to the security cameras. Danny and Stella try to figure out how to catch this \"ghost.\" She appears to be, as Stella puts it, \"a personal shoplifter\" for someone (as in someone\u0027s personal bodyguard).\n\nCase number two has Sheldon, Mac and Flack investigating a murder at a \"hedge maze,\" one of those hedge puzzle-designs where you can easily lost once inside them. The victim, a college student, was in this public place after hours, so Mac thinks he was lured there and then murdered. It appears later that it might be the work of some \"secret society\" on campus.\n\nNeither of these two cases wound up with satisfying endings. One is another lets-feel-sorry- for-the-poor criminal who had bad things happen to her earlier in her life. These things excuse the current criminal activities, at least to the people who write these Antony Zuicker/Ann Donahue-created CSI TV shows.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
