I was kind of expecting more of a road trip type of movie but it turned out to be much more than that. Although I was not really aware of Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara\u0027s political career I am now and this movie depicts what drove him to get involved in his chosen cause. Although I do not support communism I could definitely see how seeing the poverty and suffering of the poor in South America could galvanize a person into action. A few friends of mine have been to South America and have commented on the poverty they saw there, I guess this film was perhaps intended to be a social commentary as much as it was meant to be entertaining. In spite of all this heavier content there were still plenty of comic moments and conversation to be enjoyed as well. Definitely worth seeing.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
