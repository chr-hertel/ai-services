It wasn\u0027t very good. Not too funny at all. I don\u0027t know what all the hype is all about. It isn\u0027t worth a look, even if you catch it on cable. I love comedies and watch a lot of movies, but this one was pretty bad. Steve Martin\u0027s acting was phony and not \"at his best\" like some have claimed. Maybe my expectations were too high. It isn\u0027t the worst thing I have seen, by any stretch, but not good at all. Oh well, I\u0027m glad to get this one off my DVR once and for all. \n\nI really don\u0027t know what else to say about this movie. \n\n*spoiler***************\n\nThere is a scene where Steve Martin is working at a gas station and three Latinos are stealing gas and tires from him. He decides to show them by hooking up a roped hook to the car and puts the other end on a water pipe at a church next door. When the guys drive off, half of the church goes with them, wedding in progress. It was unrealistic and unfunny. I mean, I love ridiculous humor like the Scary Movie series or the Airplane movies, Funny Farm, Fletch movies, etc... but this is just stupid. \n\nDon\u0027t waste your time with this one. Sorry Steve Martin. The more I think about your work, like Father of the Bride, Three Amigos, and some other stuff, I really am coming to the conclusion that you are not that funny. You, Steve Martin, are overrated for sure. I never realized until now how unfunny he is.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
