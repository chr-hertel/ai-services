In this quirky television show, he plays lovable Earl Hickey who wants to redeem himself and bring karma to his life. He creates a list of over 200 people, deeds, and mistakes that he made. Last night on NBC, they aired 4 episodes and I was in love with Jason Lee and Earl. This comedy is well-written and well-meaning. I loved the episode with the multi-talented and recently won an Emmy, Kathryn Joosten, who is quite his match. I could watch Kathryn in anything. I hope she reappears in this show too. I don\u0027t care for much of the supporting cast. I feel that Jason Lee is the heart and soul of the show. There is no audience like in normal sitcoms. I miss that today. While I am laughing at the show, I am enjoying what other critics have enjoyed. I know that I have disliked Arrested Development simply because I could not stand the characters. But with Earl, you have to like him. He reminds you of somebody. Maybe it will encourage others to change for the better and improve their karma.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
