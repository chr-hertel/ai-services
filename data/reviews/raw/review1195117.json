It\u0027s about boxing, but there is so much more in it. The movie excels at showing how one can have everything in life, and then the next moment you have to do any job you\u0027re being offered to be able to get the minimum to survive.\n\nActing is excellent, ..... but the fights are just tremendous. It just feels as if you were in the ring with them fighting. Craig Bierko was the most impressive to me as Max Bear. Russell Crowe and Ren√©e Zellweger are great too. But I was also impressed by Paul Giamatti in his role. \n\nThis is one of the must see movies.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
