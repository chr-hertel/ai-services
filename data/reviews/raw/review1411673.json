They all really enjoyed it. Even though I have seen it several times now, I always find it funny. The cast is very talented, especially Tyler Christopher. The soundtrack has some really catchy music; several tunes you may even find yourself humming later. \n\nThis movie shows the lengths someone will go through to achieve success to ultimately find out what is really important to them. If I were to compare it to other movies, I would say it is Tootsie meets Rock Star. I strongly recommend this movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
