Dances With Wolves is that film - for me at least - or one of them. I specificy me because the last time I saw this was when I was a young\u0027un and today I am delighted to discover a film that is just as beautiful and moving as I remember it. I was judging it for its pure surface value then - and now I could judge it on that or anything else - on every level this film manages to succeed. It is one of the last of the Great Hollywood Romantic Epics tailored for for the spiritual grandeur of John Ford. Luckily for us, director Costner happens to be Ford\u0027s near-exact size. It\u0027s sad Ford died 17 years before the release of this film, because it is one while watching, one wishes Ford had seen it too. You know he would have been pleased. \n\nThis was also that brief point in Kevin Costner\u0027s career where he was suddenly likable, and charismatic, and INTERESTING. Wow! Dances With Wolves is to Kevin Costner as is Wonder Boys is to Michael Douglas. Here he brings it together with a superb directing job that finely rivals Martin Scorsece\u0027s work that year on Goodfellas. Many have called Dances\u0027 win one of the worst, but I\u0027m fine with it winning. Both this and Goodfellas are near perfect films in completely different ways, and some days I have a hard time deciding which is better. \n\nWhen Hollywood has neglected the subject of the Native Americans\u0027 plight (there are a few notable exceptions, such as Ford\u0027s \"Cheyenne Autumn\" and \"Little Big Man\") this film officially does all that has been missing justice in one grand, beautiful film. It begins with a spell-bindingly ridiculous sequence where Costner somehow fails to commit suicide riding a horse in front of enemy Confederate lines - it climaxes thrillingly, a battle on the creek where we twitch furiously happily every time our Sioux take down another Union\u0027er. It ends with the devastating tragedy of a historical fact. David Lean died in 1991, and I have to wonder whether he ever saw this film too. This film is very much the mix of Lean and Ford, and I can\u0027t imagine any two director\u0027s who could be more perfectly combined. There are empty spaces in their works that could be filled by the others\u0027 - and thanks to Kevin, the space is filled. \n\nIt wins Oscars for \n\nBest Supporting Actor - Rodney A. Grant Best Original Score Best Cinematography Best Costume Design \n\nand Nominations for \n\nBest Picture (and on some days I give it the win) Best Director Best Adapted Screenplay (see Best Picture) Best Actor - Kevin Costner Best Supporting Actor - Graham Greene Best Art Direction/Set Decoration Best Sound Best Editing" }
