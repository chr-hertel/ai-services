This is not the type of film I usually flock to see. For one thing, it\u0027s animated. I\u0027m not one of these adults who likes to flaunt about being a kid at heart. Call me close-minded, but I prefer seeing REAL people with REAL facial expressions. Second of all, \"fantasy\" is not exactly my favorite genre. I\u0027m a big advocate of realism in movies. I\u0027d much rather watch an indie film where characters sit in cafes and bars, and just ramble on about the mundane details of life than watch the next special effects spectacular. Until this day, I haven\u0027t seen one \"Lord of the Rings\" film. Normally, the minute I see anything too out of ordinary in a film, my mind starts to wander and I become disconnected from it.\n\nTherefore, I\u0027m pleading with people--please, please, please go see this film! I don\u0027t normally go on and on about a film\u0027s special effects. To me, what\u0027s the use of effects when...they look like effects? Watching \"Matrix Reloaded\" is the equivalent of watching two coats of paint dry in my opinion. \"Beowulf,\" on the other hand, is one of the few films I can think of that uses special effects for GOOD! The animation is absolutely incredible. There are moments in the film where I forget I\u0027m watching a piece of animation, because the characters are soooo lifelike. I know I complained previously about animated characters not showing a range of facial expressions. Not in this case. It\u0027s incredible how the emotions of the real actors were able to get converted into animation. It\u0027s so complex that I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if Anthony Hopkins gets an Oscar nomination for his performance in this film.\n\nI will preface that I saw this film in 3D. I\u0027m sure the regular version will be enjoyable as well, but Robert Zemeckis took full advantage of the 3D technology, truly making you feel like you\u0027re part of this world. This is not like back in the days when occasionally you\u0027d see some creature\u0027s arms stretch towards you, and that would be the extent of the 3D. There\u0027s a moment where Beowulf is about to get his crotch impaled, and I found myself almost gasping (I\u0027m a guy, of course). It doesn\u0027t hurt that we get to see a very lifelike replication of Angelina Jolie strutting around almost naked during her every scene.\n\nNow, for all you parents out there, DO NOT take your young ones. I find it funny that the movie is virtually being promoted as a kiddie flick. If this were R-rated, I would classify it as a hard R. I can\u0027t come up with any sort of explanation as to why this gory, gruesome film was awarded a PG-13 rating, other than....it\u0027s animated. I guess you can get away with a lot more with animated violence. Don\u0027t quote me on that, though. We\u0027re treated to such images as a monster getting stabbed in the eye and a heart getting torn out. Yet a movie with 10 uses of the F-word gets an R-rating. The MPAA is on crack. It\u0027s official.\n\nIf I have to make any mild criticism, it\u0027s that Robin Wright Penn\u0027s character looks a bit too cartoonish and flat. Ray Winstone has a great and powerful voice, and lends it well to the main character. I just find it funny that his character was the only one that had no resemblance to him. His character is tall, muscular, and handsome--the exact opposite of the real life Winstone. I liked the performances for the most part. Some have said that John Malkovich was pretty awful. I disagree. I thought he played a great heavy, as he always does. I suggest everyone checks this movie out in theaters, though. As big of a cinephile as I am, I don\u0027t usually urge people to see films on the big screen. To me, if a film is truly great, you can watch on your laptop or your I-Pod and still enjoy it just as much. \"Beowulf\" NEEDS to be seen on the big screen. It is not just a movie. It is an experience!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
