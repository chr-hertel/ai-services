At the very least the sound of the gunshot would of woke me up. It starts out fine with some twists the keep you intrigued. Then it just gets unbearably boring. What happened to the director. Did he quit?? Watching this made me angrier than any of the characters in this movie. It ha potential, no doubt, but it\u0027s like the writers couldn\u0027t keep a deadline or something and tried to finish the story as quickly as possible. Save your money and your sanity and avoid this. Or at least wait to see if it actually makes it to your local TV and that way you can switch when you start to get frustrated.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
