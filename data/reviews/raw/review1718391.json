However, never having been involved in debate myself, and never really seeing the draw of it, I was a little uncertain of how much I\u0027d truly like the film. Once I saw the first trailer for the film, I was even more uncertain. Seriously - who talks like that?! And who can understand them??! If this was the whole movie, I might well be lost. I decided to give the film a chance, though, since I wasn\u0027t a fan of rock music and had never heard of the New York Dolls before I saw New York Doll, but I fell in love with that story. I decided to trust Mr. Whiteley, and I\u0027m glad I did. There\u0027s a reason this film won the Audience Choice award at the Los Angeles Film Festival. You truly grow to care about the students in this story, and want them to be successful in this most competitive of worlds. When you get the chance (hopefully this film is picked up for distribution soon and we can all see it in the theatre), GO SEE THIS FILM. You\u0027ll be happy you did.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
