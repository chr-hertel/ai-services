Strong accolades, to be sure, but it was a film that pulled together elements from The Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield, 28 Days Later and the entire cinematic zombie cannon and blended them all together in a claustrophobic white-knuckler as terrifying as it was engrossing.\n\nIt didn\u0027t take long before Hollywood took notice of REC\u0027s buzz, as Screen Gems scrambled to green-light an English-language remake, causing fans of the original to both bemoan Hollywood\u0027s lack of originality and predict that they would only botch the result. Which is why I\u0027m surprised to write that not only is Quarantine every bit as good as the original, in some respects it actually surpasses it.\n\nIn fact, the only area in which Quarantine failed to improve was in terms of the camera work. While both are built around the reality TV hand-held camera viewpoint, REC\u0027s cinematography was much more stable, whereas Quarantine\u0027s is so erratic as to be almost nausea inducing.\n\nRoughly 90% of this movie is a shot-for-shot remake of its predecessor, however the few deviations are key improvements over the original story, which, for the uninitiated, unfolds in a decrepit apartment building as fire department first responders, with a reality TV crew in tow, find themselves embroiled in escalating madness as a mysterious contagion begins transforming the occupants into homicidal ghouls.\n\nWriters Drew and John Erick Dowdle improve upon the original by providing the viewer with a more plausible and nuanced explanation of the disease and its inception, moving away from the macabre elements of REC in favor of a scientific basis - all of which makes Quarantine a bona-fide skin crawler, and just in time for Halloween.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
