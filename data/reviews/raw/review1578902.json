What a great combination of mystery, thrills, chills, and blood-soaked battles. \n\nI understand some people having a problem with Antonio Banderas playing an Arab. He\u0027s a Spaniard - so he looks and sounds like a Spaniard. But I really think he gives a great performance here. He really makes his transformation from pampered Lothario to warrior compelling and believable. He has this great intensity that takes the action to a whole other level. The largely unknown supporting cast is also great. They feel totally authentic. \n\nWithout a doubt this is one of John McTiernan\u0027s best films. He was really on a role in the late 90\u0027s - which makes you wonder just what went wrong with Rollerball and Basic. Hopefully he\u0027ll return to form - cause few directors can move the camera as well as he can.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
