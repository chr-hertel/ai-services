Let\u0027s not forget Maggie Gyllenhall (sp?) she\u0027s exquisite as a cookie enchantress and rebel Goddess! Dustin Hoffman is genius - Will Ferrell seems to have taken acting lessons from Jack Webb and Emma Thompson - is forever the greatest actress of our day - comedic and otherwise (ok - Meryl is good too - can someone get them together in a film?) This is a classic film reminiscent of the 30\u0027s and 40\u0027s - but with contemporary story telling... We loved it - will see it again and really I want to own this one! \n\nA real gem of a movie...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
