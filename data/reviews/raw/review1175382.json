The central family is anything but warm, supportive, and understanding of her new and tragic stage in life as a widow. The Mother is a quiet character study that points up how in some societies, an elder parent is both unwelcome and seen as a burden to grownup children whose careers and status seeking overshadow all else. \n\nAs May comes to realize the world is still important to her, the lonely widow finds her libido reawakened and alive with her daughter\u0027s boyfriend, Derrek (Daniel Craig), a carpenter and rough sort. May embarks on an uninhibited sexual affair with Darrek whose character is sympathetic to her at first, but his flawed nature is quickly revealed through the pressures of the women who surround him.\n\nThis is the kind of role Hollywood actresses of a certain age whine is never written for them, but they would never appear in because of the frankness, overt sexuality, unglamorous wardrobe, little makeup, and social commentary on the vapidness of the very society that most film industry middle age actresses are enchrenched. The performance of lead actress, Anne Reid ranges from quiet to giddy and her interpretation blossoms on screen from the drab widow to a sexually alive and freed up middle age woman whose performance is sans face-lift, hair extensions, botox, and liposuction. She bares more than her soul on-screen with Craig.\n\nCraig as the enabling handyman who beds mother and daughter turns in another stellar performance that is at first sympathetic to the widow\u0027s situation, but in the end is without redemption. As his true nature unfold and he is literally the rooster in a hen-house his aimless inability to say no to the ex-wife, boring girlfriend, and her mother is blamed as the root of his ineffectual existence. While good with his hands at building a conservatory, he is unable to construct meaning in his life.\n\nOne of the best films from Britain in years, it is simply adult in its storyline. The Mother is the rare kind of film that is perhaps too honest for American audiences to tolerate having no car chase, no bling, no rap soundtrack to drown out the cretin performances by TV starlets and buff studmuffins. The Mother reflects how the aging baby boomers are now disposable people that offspring are willing to overlook, send to the retirement home, and get out of the way. May doesn\u0027t know what to do as she is made alive by Darren, isn\u0027t willing to go to the old folks home, and finds her kids are more conservative than she ever was at their age.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
