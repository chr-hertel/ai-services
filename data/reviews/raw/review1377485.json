The first X-Men Movie was a very impressive attempt at turning it to a Film and was a great Movie as was the sequel \u0027X2\u0027. But when I was reading things on the Internet and Magazines etc. The hype was building for \u0027Last Stand\u0027 to be the best in the series, when Dr. Hank McCoy (Beast, played brilliant by Kelsey Grammar) was confirmed and when Warren Worthington III (Angel, once again played superb by Ben Foster) was confirmed then you\u0027d expect this to be a great installment in the X-Men series, but I got the chance to seeing it yesterday and if you all want my honest opinion, it\u0027s the worst in the series. I was disappointed when I discovered Gambit wasn\u0027t going to be apart of it, and although Ian McKellen, Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman (Magneto, Storm and Wolverine) played the roles once again of the X-Men characters so perfect, and were brilliant at doing the job. The action in the Movie was brilliant as were the Effects, but there was Disappointments, I have to agree with past comments posted there were casulties which were shocking, and once again I agree with some past comments posted, Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) and Angel\u0027s roles were not used well enough, but in my opinion, I\u0027m English myself and Vinnie Jones in his day was a great Soccer/Football player and has shown he\u0027s a brilliant Actor but I think he shouldn\u0027t have took on the role as Juggernaut they should\u0027ve used someone that\u0027s big by nature (i.e. WWE\u0027s Paul Wight \u0027Big Show) but nevermind Vinnie Jones did well for the part, but once again a Disappointment in many ways and a Good film in others.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
