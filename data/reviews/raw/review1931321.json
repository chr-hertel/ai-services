A half-baked story that took 2/3\u0027s of the films runtime to get going, actors sleepwalking through their roles, and an action set-piece climax that is as uninvolving and boring as the majority of the film. Among the plusse...(read more) s, the films camera-work is stunning, among the highlights is the scenes showing Johnny Depp in Davy Jones locker. You wont see anything that strange and imaginative in a mainstream summer blockbuster this year. The sparse action scenes before the climax are well done, but boring. The cast does a commendable job as a whole, but they don\u0027t bring anything new that we haven\u0027t seen in the last two movies. Johnny Depp carries the film on his shoulders whenever he appears, too bad he doesn\u0027t garner much screen time in the film. Overall, the film is too complicated and takes its self too seriously for its own good. It seemed half-baked compared to the first two\u0027s strong story lines, and contained too many characters and subplots. While the 2nd film had some pirate mythology in the form of Davy Jones weaved nicely into the storyline, the third relies far too much on far-fetched pirate history and mythology to carry the plot...so much so that the world the characters inhabit looses its believability as taking place in our world, and the films endless backstories and subplots carried out for the first 2 hours becomes so tedious and boring that you just don\u0027t care anymore. The conclusion of the majority of the trilogy\u0027s main story lines did not receive enough screen time, and became lost in a pile of underdeveloped subplots. Disappointing...catch it on DVD.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
