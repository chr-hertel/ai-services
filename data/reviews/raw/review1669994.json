It was truly a unique decade for television. Series produced then are totally unlike anything produced previously or since. I don\u0027t know what it was (perhaps someone spiked the water back then), but TV in the 1960s was unique. There was a certain sense of wonder, a certain sense of the fantastic---and a definite 60s vibe of surrealism that crept into every show from \"Green Acres\" to \"Batman\" to \"Gilligan\u0027s Island.\" \n\nAnd for my money, the best show in TV\u0027s greatest decade was \"Lost in Space.\" It\u0027s impossible to describe what watching this show was like in the 1960s. It\u0027s an experience that simply can\u0027t be re-produced today. For a start, America was still an optimistic nation and we had an ambitious space program that would soon take us to the moon. For everyone who was young in the 60s, it seemed highly plausible that, we too, would get a chance to ride a rocket into space within our lifetimes. Little could we fathom that, after 1972, America wouldn\u0027t even land a person on the moon for 35 long years.\n\nToday\u0027s TV shows are stiflingly dull and seem to be created by committees that cynically use focus groups to create their sterile product. \"Lost in Space\" is a million miles away from this creative process. In fact, it\u0027s the total opposite (and all the more brilliant for this).\n\nThe greatest science fiction always had a sense of wonder and mystery. \"Lost in Space\" captured the mystery of space---indeed, the show itself was actually quite bizarre. It\u0027s a far cry from the over-rated \"Star Trek,\" which, instead of giving us a sense of mystery, followed an (increasingly stale) by-the-numbers formula.\n\nAnd \"formula\" is precisely what one did NOT get in viewing \"Lost in Space.\" Indeed, this show is so strange that, viewing it today, it seems like a relic from a lost civilization. It\u0027s hard, in fact, to really even fathom who the producers were targeting as their audience.\n\nNaturally, there are cynics who hate this show, and fall over themselves pointing out the plot holes and the ignorance of \"realism.\" To those folks, I say: Chill out. Even TV\u0027s \"realistic\" shows are NOT as realistic as they hyped to be. \"Star Trek,\" for example, has plenty of flaws in its science. Even a highly-praised show like \"ER,\" the medical drama, has plenty of inaccuracies (as any medical professional will tell you).\n\nIn many ways, \"Lost in Space\" does a wonderful job of capturing the essence of what made the 60s the greatest decade of the 20th century for TV, film, music, and culture in general. It\u0027s something we\u0027ll never re-capture in today\u0027s stale culture, dominated as it is by dull, overpaid celebrities. We\u0027ve gone a long ways downhill from The Beatles to \"American Idol.\"" }
