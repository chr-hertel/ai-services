I loved this movie, and yes, I love it because it is HOT! There are certain movies, like Wild Things, Body Heat and others, that just revel in pure sexuality, not of just nubile young bodies, but the sexiness of mystery and deceit and suspense and conspiracy and swampy locales.\n\nAnyone can find sexy actors and throw them up on screen and let them writhe around. But it takes special talent to truly make a movie \"hot\". It takes great writing skills to take romance novel dialog and make it presentable. It takes great acting to deliver such lines in believable, yet sexy, ways. It takes great directing to properly pace and shoot the action and ratchet up the suspense. It even takes great set direction and location spotting. It\u0027s not an easy thing to pull off, and these people pull it off superbly.\n\nThis is the \"torrid love affair\" at its sleaziest best. This is such a masterful take on this particular genre, in no way does it deserve less than a 9. I would consider it a \"must watch\" for anyone who\u0027s not a total prude.\n\n10 out of 10.\n\nBarky", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
