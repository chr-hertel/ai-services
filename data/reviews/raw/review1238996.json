This first act built up a terrific sense of foreboding. From that point on though, it was pretty crappy.\n\nafter the first hour there was about 2 hours of over blown action that was so packed with chasing and monsters that it became totally boring and uninteresting. It left you feeling like you\u0027d spent 3 full hours gorging yourself on gas station candy and red bull.\n\nPeter Jackson has a tendency to glaze over any real drama by inserting cheesy drawn out close-ups of silly melodramatic expressions. this time it was slightly more interesting than in LOTR because most of the close ups were of an ape, but nevertheless the product is a boring substitute for real emotional intrigue.\n\nfinally jack black was awful. every moment he opened his mouth i thought he was going to scream the word penis, or start shredding on air guitar. he was a really bad choice. he seemed about as out of place as one could possibly be in a movie. i did like most of the rest of the acting though, Naomi Watts was pretty good as usual.\n\nthe incredible applause this movie is receiving is just another example of the fact that very few people have the capacity to form their own opinion about things.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
