The writing was at times clever, but there was absolutely no chemistry between any of the characters. Stockard Channing was the only good thing about this movie, and she wasn\u0027t on screen often enough to make it worth it. I think Diane Lane is a super sweet actress and I tend to like the roles she chooses. However, this character was not particularly sympathetic, in my opinion. She seemed whiny and too quick to judge. John Cusack I also normally like, but just not in this film. On the whole, it was a truly forgettable story. Save yourself the time and money and go watch Under the Tuscan Sun.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
