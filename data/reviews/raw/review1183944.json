Really, I do. But I walked out of this flick after the fourth gratuitous shot of her super-flat tummy writhing under water. I even sat through the underwater wedgies (and believe me, there\u0027s enough to please even the most hardened critic).\n\nNo idea how the plot unfolded or whether or not they all lived whatever was supposedly chasing them; I couldn\u0027t stomach more than twenty minutes of this movie. We know she\u0027s hot. We know Paul Walker was carved out of marble in some back-alley Italian studio. Could we please all move on now? The best part of this whole \u0027film\u0027 was my cinnamon soft pretzel, and even then I couldn\u0027t enjoy it, knowing that the stars of this movie probably haven\u0027t seen such carbs in YEARS.\n\nSo my twenty-minute review: nice abs, Jess. Walker, great tan. Writers - uh, HELLO? (I guess that\u0027s what their target audience cares about anyway, but they could have at least pretended to be building an actual story.) Anxious to see what others say who were able to sit through the whole thing.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
