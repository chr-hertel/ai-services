People are going to always compare this movie to the first one and Eric Mabius to Brandon Lee. That\u0027s where I think this movie suffers.\n\nI think storyline-wise it would have been better of he hadn\u0027t have resurrected right after his execution. They should have left him dead for a while. When he came back it didn\u0027t really seem like all that much of a shock. The bad guys just thought they had botched the execution and mistakenly pronounced him dead. Maybe even have gone so far as to have him resurrect on the autopsy table, not from his grave because that would have been a direct copy of Crow number One.\n\nAll in all a decent little flick but suffers from comparisons to its predecessors." }
