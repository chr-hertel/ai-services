After killing the bum, and dumping him in the river, things actually get worse: the water supply comes from this very same river.\n\nWriter-Director Eli Roth is like the great American hope when it comes to horror movies. He grew up ingesting 70s and 80s horror (which are undeniably the best decades for horror ever) and is personal friends with director David Lynch and composer Angelo Badalamenti (who made some of the music for this film)... This is the perfect witch\u0027s cauldron to brew up the future of horror and save us from the mediocre horse crap that\u0027s been coming out the past 15 years.\n\nCabin Fever is the cure. We have a group of teenagers going to the woods to party, and they end up encountering a monster that\u0027s actually believable: a flesh-eating virus. With music that sets the tone, perfect lighting, quality acting and gobs and buckets of blood, gore fans are in for a treat. The clich√© of teenagers drunk in the woods actually makes sense rather than simply being an overdone idea. In an odd turn of events, the alcohol turns out to be their only hope for salvation (but will they find out in time?). \n\nAnd a powerful performance by Rider Strong. All the actors were great, and the characters were dead-on. I have seen films where characters aren\u0027t developed enough to know them or over-developed (because why should we care if they\u0027ll die anyway). I could identify most of the kids in this film with people I\u0027ve known in real life: Strong as the boy in love with his childhood friend, the guy who will only drink beer... these are real personalities.\n\nAnother great thing about this movie is the humor. I found myself laughing out loud a dozen times in the first fifteen minutes. And as the movie gets darker, so does the humor. You have to be truly sick to find some of it funny, but if you\u0027re watching horror films you\u0027re probably sick enough. Keep an eye on the sign behind the rabid boy when they return to the shop. The reference to \"Deliverance\" combined with the kung-fu is something you will never forget. And the end of the movie, which I won\u0027t reveal here, has one of the strangest \"reverse racist\" jokes I\u0027ve ever seen. And the character of Winston, while a bit of an extreme case of caricature, is pretty amusing.\n\nIf you\u0027re a fan of horror, be sure to watch the making-of documentary. It\u0027s only 20 minutes, so you won\u0027t get bored as they quickly move from the acting to music to effects. Not too technical, but gives you enough overview to really appreciate the thought that went into every little detail. \n\nRoger Ebert says, \"The movie adds up to a few good ideas and a lot of bad ones, wandering around in search of an organizing principle.\" I don\u0027t agree with Ebert at all, which is sad because I normally would. The film is quite organized and linear, with a central theme and plot. The \"few good ideas\" permeate the course of the film. Are the \"bad ideas\" his homages to other films? The use of the theme from \"Last House on the Left\" was brilliant and subtle.\n\nAs I said in the intro, Eli Roth is the man you want making your horror films -- he knows the secret recipe and accepts no substitutions. Highly recommended!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
