This movie is very long, about 6 hours, but it is cleverly set up. You follow along with the current time line of watching Lili find her mother, all the while watching flashbacks to get the history and back story. The suspense is there to make the watcher guess and try to figure things out along with Lili. When the very end arrives and you all find out what you have been waiting for, it is very gratifying. \n\nThis is definitely a movie that is great for a sick day or a snow day...you know, one that you sit around all day and veg out. I just wish that I can find it on DVD!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
