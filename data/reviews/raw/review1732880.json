This movie was not great enough .It\u0027s maybe the high expectation i had from it , seeing that everyone seem to ejaculate when they think about the godfather movie.Have seen some people falling asleep during this movie.But the movie is good!Because it\u0027s the GODFATHER! LOL\n\nIt\u0027s could be because the version i watched had no sub-tittle.With all the Italian conversation in this movie(which is around 30% of the movie) i could barely not fall asleep being i don\u0027t understand Italian and i had no sub-tittle.It\u0027s sure does not help.\n\nThe acting is superb .But the role don\u0027t seem to be much complicated to play.Everyone keep telling me that this movie is the best.But what make a movie the best?The acting?The story?The Action?\n\nI\u0027m quite happy godfather 2 for me was boring.I\u0027m an intelligent person that most of the time enjoy great story.But this movie just seem to give retard a reason that they are indeed intelligent and love great movie.I LOVE THE GODFATHER SO I LOVE GOOD MOVIE WOWOWO.\n\nWhen i watch a movie.I want to have some show and not some chatting during 2 hours and pretend that i love this kind of movie because the *acting is superb*.Give me a freaking break.Ace Venture it\u0027s a stupid movie.But at least it\u0027s entertaining\n\nThe music is also over-used.I was quite tired to hear the same background music each frigging time just because they want to enhance the *emotion*.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
