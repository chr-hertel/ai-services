I wanted to walk out partway, but didn\u0027t want to damage the director who was going to lead a Q \u0026 A afterward. The film was uneven, sometimes hackneyed and incomprehensible by the end. It didn\u0027t make any sense despite the symbolism and clues throughout both the dark and light worlds. Thora Birch was brave and worked hard to be real in both roles, but the separation between dark and light was too emphatic. THe resolution made no sense whatsoever and I advise people to save their money and time unless they have to analyze a film for a psychology class. My time would have been better spent standing in line for Pan\u0027s Labryth again.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
