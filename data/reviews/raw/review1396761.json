Great action movie. Wonderful role reversal with Geena Davis as the hard guy and Samuel Jackson as the \"buddy\" when the initial set-up was designed to show SLJ as the lead/hero. The way in which Geena transforms from the ditsy American housewife to a truly frightening persona in the first minutes is a bit \"Jason Bourne\" like but gripping all the same. When Samantha finally becomes Charlie, it is a not unexpected but nevertheless surprising transformation. It takes the whole movie to a new level of suspense and excitement.\n\nThe bad guys are really bad and you don\u0027t mind them meeting their just desserts. At the same time you want the heroine/hero to survive at all costs and that gives it the edge over other action movies. As a Brit, I rate Die Hard and Lethal Weapon as A1 action movies - the Arnie Schwarzenegger as A2 and Steven Seagal Seagal as A2/3. This is A1.5 in my view. I love Renny\u0027s dialogue/character development/imagination as well as the usual bangs and flashes - so I think it will become a classic in twenty years time", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
