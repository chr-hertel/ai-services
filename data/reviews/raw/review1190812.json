I saw the film in the movie section of a TV magazine. but i thought it was on sky movies and i do not have sky movies, but the film was actually on turner classic movies (TCM for short) but when i found that out, i had missed it. So i then bought the film on 2-disc special edition DVD. I hadn\u0027t seen the film before i watched it on DVD but i was hoping that i would like the film or it would be a waste of the Â£10 i paid for it. but i loved it.\n\nThe film has an amazing plot but i don\u0027t want to spoil the plot for you so watch the film and find out. The film has an excellent cast and all the actors acted at their very best.\n\nif you love gangster films SEE THIS NOW! 10/10 Excellent film thanks for reading", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
