The shooter has two requests to Violet: she should never dress in red, and never get pregnant; otherwise he would be disturbed and loose his accuracy. Violeta gets pregnant and uses a red colored dress in the show.\n\n\"A Mulher do Atirador de Facas\" was awarded in Gramado Festival in the following categories: Best Direction, Best Actress and Best Music Score. However, I did not like this short film. The story is very intriguing, but the open end gave me the feeling that the movie has not ended. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"A Mulher do Atirador de Facas\" (\"The Wife of the Knives Shooter\")", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
