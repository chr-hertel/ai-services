I know that many, who have commented, feel pretty much the same (or close to it), so I won\u0027t make my comments long, and drawn out. I cannot praise this show enough. Never, not even once, did I see a false moment in any episode. That last statement, by all accounts, describes perfection that is not a place to go carelessly. I try to watch movies, TV shows, or even small productions of college plays with an extremely discerning eye, and every moment was an exercise in character truthfulness. The entire cast, whether you liked all of them or not (another subject, for another time), was excellent ensemble cohesiveness.\n\nMy (then) girlfriend, and I could not wait to see what G\u0027s hair-style/do would look like from episode to episode; we always made comparison\u0027s based on the previous week\u0027s look. My personal favorite, in the cast, was Andre Braugher\u0027s \"Frank Pembleton\". \"Frank\" appeared to be (inwardly) driven to perfection, while at the same time trying not to make it look that way  his co-workers knew him too well, to be fooled by his outward demeanor.\n\nThis was one of television\u0027s finest moments. In the history of television, I cannot find a better show some, many may argue, may have been just as good I\u0027m not sure that there were any better." }
