I remember the first time I saw \"A Bug\u0027s Life\" and \"Toy Story.\" There was a big \"WOW!\" factor because the colors were so outstanding, as were the sound and the animation. Now that this has become commonplace, a really good animated movie must give us more. For me, \"Shrek\" and \"Monsters Inc.\" gave me more. But \"Valiant\" does not. It is OK, good entertainment, but old hat by now.\n\nIt is set in 1944 in England and France. Carrier pigeons are needed to send important messages. There is a recruiting push and this one, young, small pigeon named Valiant who wants to help his country, Great Britian. He gets trained and is sent on a mission.\n\nThe bad guys are German Falcons who are occupying France. They capture and torture the pigeons to get some inside information. Many accomplished British actors voice the animated characters, including Ewan McGregor as Valiant, plus Tim Curry , Jim Broadbent , Hugh Laurie, John Cleese , John Hurt, and Olivia Williams as Victoria the nurse pigeon who becomes the girl waiting for Valiant to return safely. \n\nSPOILERS. There really is a story here, and Valiant has to elude two German Falcons while crossing the English Channel to deliver the important message, narrowly making it. The message, scrap the plans the Allies had, and instead attack at Normandy. The rest is history." }
