Probably the most vivid and effective use of Technicolor I have seen. Lush photography, great crane shots and an impressive Paris Opera House! The operatic scenes are very well done--and they are important to the story line. Very entertaining, especially since there is no graphic violence or gore--except the Phantom\u0027s face. Nelson Eddy is in top voice. One of Hollywood\u0027s most versatile actors, Claude Rains is remarkable in the lead role. Just the year before he was the memorable Prefect of Police in \"Casablanca.\" This production is mounted first class in every way.\n\nThe DVD release is a fantastic transfer from an original old Technicolor master.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
