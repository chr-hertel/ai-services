My brother had some toys and that is about my only experience with these. The movie looked good though, so I went to see it yesterday. It was great! and it was the first time in awhile the audience actually clapped.\n\nShia and the rest of the cast were all very good in their roles and well placed. The graphics were awesome and really made you want to keep your eyes open so you wouldn\u0027t miss a thing. The length was perfect, not too long, not too short. There was plenty going on to keep my interest through the whole thing.\n\nSo whether you are already a Transformers fan or not, you should check out this movie soon as you can :)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
