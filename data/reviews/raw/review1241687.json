Lock-Stock without the Jokes.", "reviewBody": "Like \u0027Scarface\u0027 \u0027Rollin with the Nines\u0027 is set to be a cult movie. This Movie is all about a very hotly debated topic which is spiralling out of control namely \"Black on Black\" Gun Crimes in the UK. It\u0027s not about white cop\u0027s even though they play a small part. Let it be know this Movie is about Urban-Life in the UK, what we call \"The grime\". In the same way that movies like \u0027Boyz in the Hood\u0027 and \u0027Menace to Society\u0027 awoke the general American psyche this film is destined to do likewise. \u0027City of Gods\u0027 told a story which the general World-population was totally oblivious to and \u0027Rollin with the Nines\u0027will no doubt have the same affect. The Lead is prodigiously played by VAS BLACKWOOD(Rory Breaker, Lock-Stock and Two Smoking) Who delivers Machiavellian style performance. Robbie Gee(Snatch)Commands the Screen with such poetic intimidation that he reminded me of a Young Samuel L. Jackson. The third male lead is played by Newcomer Roffem Morgan and trust me given the right breaks this Kid will become a Star. The Female lead is played Naomi Taylor. This is also Naomi first film debut and for her Stardom is only a plane ticket too Hollywood away. \u0027Rollin with the Nines\u0027 is a gun slinging, crime don\u0027t pay Hit Movie. Finally the soundtrack left me Breathless. Go see this movie." }
