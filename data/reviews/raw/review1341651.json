He livened up the 1980s and 1990s with sharp, sassy films on a wide variety of subjects. Now he\u0027s just beginning to look like a bitter has-been with a wide variety of prejudices which he likes to spread to a wider audience.\n\nAs a film, there are many enjoyable moments from a stellar cast including the ever-watchable Clive Owen and Denzel Washington. (In my opinion no film with Denzel is ever an entire waste of your hard-earned as the man has such presence and charisma).\n\nHowever, beyond that the plot start out implausible and descends into the totally unbelievable. It\u0027s like a cardboard box left out in the rain - it starts out looking like it\u0027s got a structure but after a while it\u0027s just a sodden mess. Key protagonists (particularly Owen\u0027s character) have no background or apparent motivation.\n\nOverall, a superficially well-made film is let down by flimsy material and lazy direction.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
