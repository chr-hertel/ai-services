I loved the Matrix, written by the same brothers. If you go to the movies every week, it\u0027s worth seeing compared to what\u0027s out there. But if like me, you can only slip enough time in for the big ones....wait for the video on this one.\n\nGreat fight scenes. Interesting story line. Intriguing supporting characters. Natalie Portman\u0027s character is genuine and well portrayed. The only character that left me feeling empty was the main character, the radical, political reformist known only as \"V.\" As much as the writers tried to define him, you\u0027re never left with the impression of humanity. Perhaps that was what they were striving for and just missed the fine line between that and a stock character.\n\nHowever, the Wachowski brothers\u0027 clever way with a plot will still entertain you and it is still a worthy rental.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
