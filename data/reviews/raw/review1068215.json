He has a contract put out on the mystery boyfriend but the hit is botched and his wife is killed instead. Now he wants both the mystery boyfriend and the hit man deadÂ…but who the \"mystery boyfriend\" and \"hit man\" turn out to be....\n\nThis film is TV movie quality with a nice twist at the end (50-50 chance you\u0027ll guess it). Has some semi graphic sex scenes and a short non-nudity rape sequence.\n\nRon Perlman has a supporting role as a private investigator with secrets both past and present and he imbues his character with a nice mix of regret and ruthlessness.\n\nFavorite line(s): spoken by the husband to his and his wife\u0027s friend: \"You would tell me if she were having an affair, wouldn\u0027t you?\" her reply: \"Would I tell her if you were having an affair?\"\n\nWorth a rent/buy used.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
