Only it works too well, both at work and at home, where Green\u0027s budding relationship with Kathy Lacey (Dorothy McGuire) unravels as she sweats disapproval from her upper-crust friends in Manhattan and Darien, Connecticut. Will helping do away with a societal ill cost Phil a relationship he holds so dear?\n\nNo question \"Gentleman\u0027s Agreement\" is a compelling demonstration of the power of film, as it shed a light on an aspect of American life as no popular entertainment dared before, with marked success. It won an Oscar for Best Picture of 1947, and seemed to change attitudes about what was and wasn\u0027t acceptable discourse.\n\nIf it wasn\u0027t for the acting, directing, and screenplay, \"Gentleman\u0027s Agreement\" might even be a great film. Peck gives another of his characteristically stiff performances, denuding his exchanges with other characters of the slightest traces of doubt or humor. McGuire is a vapid compilation of trite romantic phrases, telling Green she\u0027s all his and he\u0027s right about everything but could he please give the Jewish thing a rest for just one night? John Garfield shines as Green\u0027s Jewish buddy and voice of conscience, mainly because he avoids the same over-the-top acting mannerisms Albert Dekker as Green\u0027s publisher and Anne Revere as his mother employ with mind-bending regularity.\n\nMoss Hart\u0027s script and Elia Kazan\u0027s direction come off strident even when not addressing the film\u0027s central concern. When we first meet Green, walking around Rockefeller Center with his son (Dean Stockwell), they look up at a statue of Atlas carrying the world, which the boy compares to his Dad. Later, as Green sweats over what angle to use to get at this anti-Semitism thing, we see him actually cracking a nut in order to underscore the point.\n\nBut when the film has an effective scene, it really makes it stick. Like the famous one of Green trying to get a room at the Flume Inn, and confronting the smug manager about whether his hotel is restricted. \"Do you practice the Hebrew religion yourself, or are you just making sure?\" the manager asks. Or Garfield noting Green\u0027s strain from such exchanges comes from not being \"insulated\" by constant exposure. Even McGuire rallies a little near the end, telling Green she hates what he\u0027s made her feel about herself and then confessing her own hypocrisy to Garfield.\n\nI feel a hypocrite myself. If \"Gentleman\u0027s Agreement\" had died at the box office in 1947, I wouldn\u0027t be giving it a passing grade now. It\u0027s badly dated, and often sloppy in its aim (I wince for that poor guy who gets both barrels for asking Green what he did during the war and thinking it was PR.) But it asks tough questions, gives tough answers, and leaves me thinking like Kathy about all the times I could have said and done more than I did when confronted with intolerance toward others.\n\n\"It\u0027s really each house, each family that decides it,\" Green says, and there\u0027s no question that \"Gentleman\u0027s Agreement\" has helped many decide it the right way.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
