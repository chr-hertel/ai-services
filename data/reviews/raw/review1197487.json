That thing that doesn\u0027t look right. That person who is there but should not be there. Something that seems to be following you. \n\nSigaw is genuinely, deeply creepy.\n\nI don\u0027t know if Hollywood would see they\u0027ve got a gem of a film here. Sigaw has its peculiar sense of timing. It certainly doesn\u0027t conform to a Hollywood formula of one scare per ten minutes. There is a long scene where the director keeps you in a state of simple nervous expectancy. And then are there are non stop scares where you\u0027re hardly allowed to breath. But that\u0027s exactly why fans of horror will need and want this one. It\u0027s a shot in the arm for the genre.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
