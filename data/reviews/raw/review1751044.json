The story of the film is fictional, loosely based on the photographer Diane Arbus, yet the point of this film is missed by many. It is about the development of character and personality and is made purely for entertainment, this is executed very well and there is a strange likeness between the real Arbus and the one portrayed in the film.\n\nActing is the strongest point of this film and Nicole Kidman (Moulin Rouge, Eyes Wide Shut, The Others) who plays Diane Arbus gives one of the strongest performances of the film, portraying the frailty and emotional battle that Arbus is going through during this movie and I firmly believe that Kidman was in fact snubbed at the 2007 Academy Awards for her performance which was beautifully and emotionally executed. Robert Downey Jr. (Black and White, Gothika) who plays Lionel Sweeney a man suffering from a disease which means he has an excessive growth of hair also gives a strong solid performance here, proving that he also is a reliable, consistent and believable actor who has also been snubbed of awards nearly as many times as leading lady Kidman, I feel that this film is one of the roles he has been snubbed for. Other good supporting roles in this film include Ty Burrell (Evolution) as Allan Arbus and Jane Alexander (The Way) as Gertrude Nemerov.\n\nThe music in the film is amazing and captures a perfect, dramatic atmosphere of the film and my kudos goes to Carter Burwell the composer of the soundtrack. The editing is also a beautiful and entrancing factor of this film, giving the film a very arty feel. The editing is well thought out and is used very well in almost all of the film.\n\nOverall \"Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus\" is an interesting film that leaves you appreciating life and love but above all things is makes you appreciate art and how it can affect our lives and change it forever. The film is well directed and my hat goes off to Steven Shainberg, the same can also be said about the cast of this film and the whole cast gives solid performances, particularly Kidman and Downey Jr.\n\n5 out of 5 stars.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
