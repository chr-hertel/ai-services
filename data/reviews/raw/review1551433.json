Not for the blood, sweat, and tears. Nor for the soundtrack that brings back fond memories, although that is a great touch. Rocky is my favorite character of any film of all time, and I absolutely love this series of films. This film is a much more fitting end to the series than was Rocky V, although Rocky V was still a great film in my opinion. His character is always tested, and he comes through with the heart of a champion and a general understanding of goodwill to all. Unlike most Rocky fans, I love the story more than the action. I appreciate all movies from that regard. If a great story is told and a strong message can be taken from it, then a film has the potential to be great. First I will give my order of favorite Rocky movies from this measure: 1, 2, Rocky Balboa, 5, 4, and 3 comes in last. This goes against the majority, as 4 is near the top for most it seems. I appreciate the story, and I admire the character of Rocky. The first two set the story of an insignificant person with a lot of heart doing something great not for glory and not for riches, but to prove his worth to himself. Three and four fall away from that and become just action movies with the characters, but little of that character value of the character of Rocky Balboa. Rocky V has the struggle of going back to insignificance, and showing the difference between Rocky\u0027s heart on less talent and less heart and more talent from other fighters. That movie brings the character of Rocky back, and Rocky Balboa does not disappoint. He is now in his upper 50\u0027s, and is wiser for it. He is significant in his world and wants/needs one more shot to prove his worth to himself. It brings back the desire to be significant and to prove one\u0027s worth. He does it through wisdom, leadership, caring of those around him, and the heart that made the original so significant a film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
