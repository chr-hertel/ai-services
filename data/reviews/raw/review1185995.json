Yes this movie about Coast Guard divers plays Journey\u0027s hit \"Open Arms\" 3 times! If that weren\u0027t enough amazement, the score for this film is literally the same song for EVERY scene. I could hum along about 30 minutes into the film every time the score kicked in. Those were my observations. It was so funny and annoying that it kind of took away from the seriousness of the film and made me enjoy it less. It\u0027s not a bad film, and I would even say that it is worth seeing but I wouldn\u0027t go to any lengths to seek it out (as it is not available in the US yet). As I have read, it has been turned into a TV show in Japan and that makes sense because the whole 120 minutes seemed like a pilot for TV show.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
