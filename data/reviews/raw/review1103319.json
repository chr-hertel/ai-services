The opening really gets your attention and draws you right in and then ... nothing. It seemed like an extremely slow moving film but I liked a few of the performances (Winters and Richards), great set pieces and it\u0027s something that has stayed with me for a long time even though haven\u0027t seen this movie since the early80s. It probably helps if you\u0027re a kid watching this for the first time, then again .. maybe not! It seems like a super-obscure film as well. I\u0027ve talked to a few hardcore film buffs who are completely unfamiliar with this particular film." }
