Directed by Jean Renoir, it apparently was badly edited by RKO; thus, it sometimes felt to this viewer as if large sections were omitted.\n\nRobert Ryan plays Scott, a Coast Guard officer with post-traumatic stress from the war. Psychologically, he\u0027s a little off balance. I suppose saying \"Robert Ryan\" and \"a little off balance\" is saying the same thing, given the roles he played, but there we are. He\u0027s set to be married to a lovely woman, Eve, (Nan Leslie), and in fact, urges her to marry him even sooner than planned in an early scene. A few minutes later, he\u0027s madly in love with Peggy (Bennett), whom he sees collecting driftwood on the beach near an old wreck. Her husband Tod, it turns out, is a great artist, now blind from a fight with his wife. The two of them have a fairly sick relationship, with Tod apparently tempting Peggy with good-looking young guys to see if she\u0027ll cheat on him. At one point during dinner with the couple, Scott passes a lighter across to Peggy and Tod head turns as the flame passes him. When Peggy walks Scott out of the house she says, \"No, Scott, you\u0027re wrong.\" So Scott, somewhere in a cut out section, became convinced that Tod can see, tells Peggy, and feels that Tod failed the test. But you have to fill that in because it\u0027s not in the movie. It doesn\u0027t occur to him, I suppose, that Tod felt the heat of the light. Finally, Scott takes Tod for a walk along the cliffs, determined to find out for once and for all if he can see or not.\n\nThe film holds one\u0027s interest because of the direction, atmosphere, and performances, but things seem to happen very quickly. Eve complains to Scott that he didn\u0027t stop by the night before - which she considers a sign that they are drifting apart - and he tells her that he shouldn\u0027t be married. In the film it seems like that happens within 24 hours from the time he wants to get married immediately. Fickle. One suspects another cut.\n\nThis is a film about becoming free of obsession, and though some found the end ambiguous, it did seem clear to me that there was some resolution. The three leads are excellent - Bennett and Bickford play a couple with a strong history that has led to a love/hate \"Virginia Woolf\" type of relationship along with infidelity on her part; Ryan, looking quite young here, is handsome, sincere and gullible as a man who, while trying to break free of his demons, walks into a situation that feeds on them rather than resolves them.\n\nWith a more judicious cutting, \"The Woman on the Beach\" could have been a really fantastic film, with its psychological underpinnings being far ahead of their time. As it is, it\u0027s still worth watching, though if I\u0027d been Renoir, I would have been plenty angry at RKO for what was done to this movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
