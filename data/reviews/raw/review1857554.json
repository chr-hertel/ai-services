Not that I\u0027m an expert or anything but I have a pre-paid pass that means I can see as many movies I want at the cinema for a year.\n\nAnd with that pass I watch everything. To the end.\n\nI\u0027ve seen a lot of terrible movies and a lot of good movies but Diary of the Dead was one of a very few that I have actually walked out on my own decision.\n\nBeing a George AR fan naturally I expected good things. Land of the Dead was enjoyable enough, I liked it. Bought it. I own all the others and I consider the original three to be horror masterpieces, but masterpiece this movie is not.\n\nPlagued with dire acting, over-preachy inconsistent plot riddled with cringeworthy clichés, I could honestly find no good qualities watching this. Hated the characters(whiny, emotionless, clichéd, students) who just did not convince me that this was real at all. In fact the camera style, also similarly used in REC and Cloverfield is supposed to install a sense of realism but everything felt incredibly staged, from actors to scenarios and really detached me from the whole experience.\n\nAnd with little action altogether(Judging from the 60mins I saw) it felt more like a film about a group of students pretty standard psychophysical debate set during a zombie invasion. In reality it should have been students trying to survive during a zombie invasion but with such a lack of emotion from every character it seemed like this was just a pretty average day.\n\nAll in all this is definitely one of the worst movies I\u0027ve seen in recent years and has truly made me believe that George AR isn\u0027t just having a bad streak, but may be going completely senile.\n\nHowever I may watch it if it ever comes my way, some people are giving it good ratings and now I want to see if it changes into a completely different movie after the 60th minute because the pile of pants I watched doesn\u0027t even deserve a vote or even a damn entry into IMDb for being such a half-assed, poor excuse for a film." }
