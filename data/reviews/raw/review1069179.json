One is now married with a child one is dating but both are unhappy as memories of their one night keep either of them from successfully pursuing happiness with anyone else.\n\nTheir dialog is enchanting, honest and brilliant and you can imagine saying exactly what they are saying to one another if you were in their shoes.\n\nTheir interaction with one another is so natural and unrehearsed and you feel as though you are part of their very intimate conversation. The ending leaves you wondering if Jesse caught his flight back to New York or not but that is the beauty of it, you get to draw your own conclusions." }
