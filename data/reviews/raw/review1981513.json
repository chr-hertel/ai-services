Jose Campos as Professor Jaime Rodriguez offers up the conflict between two gods, the good Quetzacoatl (in service to Venus) and evil Tezcatlipoca, the living mummy Nanautzin cult leader of the latter, requiring a total of five sacrifices to Tezcatlipoca every 52 years until his millennial rebirth in 2027. The victims are all warriors of valor and strength, each found with their hearts ritualistically cut out, the 5th victim a willing sacrifice to be slain by Nanautzin himself. Ramon Bieri\u0027s Captain Webster (not to be confused with his Captain Baker in \"Bad Medicine\") is particularly useless on this occasion, though Sorrell Booke has a humorous cameo as a temperamental taxidermist who identifies certain feathers as coming from parrots native to southern Mexico. The less than willing final sacrifice is played by Erik Estrada, whose character is described as a \u0027monumental dummy\u0027 by a coworker, which Vincenzo can\u0027t help but pick up on: \"as for having dummies in key staff positions, I\u0027m as guilty as the next!\" This would forever be linked to \"Demon in Lace\" as the two episodes used for the compilation feature \"Demon and the Mummy,\" the reason why they were left out of CBS syndication.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
