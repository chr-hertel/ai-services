Totally unbelievable characters and film. Absolute suspension of intelligence and belief are required to watch the \"Bourne Identity\". The only positive feature of this flick is the genuine attempt of Matt Damon to be a serious actor. You really feel sorry for him, he is so obviously out of his depth. Damon is no spy. American Intelligence is a true oxymoron as Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are portrayed as two faced bumblers. Clive Owen should have been the main character instead of the struggling Damon, Owen and his craft are wasted and he has all of 3 or 4 lines in the film. It was nice to see Simon Adebisi from \"Oz\" in a film, even a lame one such as this. The fight scenes are mere cartoons and hilarious, and their pathetic execution are the highlights of this film. The one scene where a wild haired blonde guy with swimming goggles flies through the window firing a machine gun is the best. The fight continues in super fast and slow mode and once beaten and killed, the bad guy rises up like Nosferatu. It was a direct rip off of Jim Carey\u0027s fantasy fight scene in \"Dumb and Dumber\". You\u0027ll wet your pants. Poor Matt Damon. 1 out of 10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
