I recommend watching it with friends.This movie is great because a lot of teenagers can relate to it in that Napolean is kind of a nerd who is trying to help a friend and getting laughed at because of it. I related to Napolean in that I fight with my sister a lot just like Naplolean does with Kip. Uncle Rico is a typical weird uncle. He is convinced that \"if coach put me in 4th quarter we would have won the championship no doubt.\" I think that is HILARIOUS! I love it when Uncle Rico throws the steak at Napolean. My Favorite characters are, of course, Napolean, Deb, Pedro, and LaFawnduh. Another way teens can relate to Napolean is that he has to deal with a major prep (Summer) and EVERYONE has to deal with that at least once in their life.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
