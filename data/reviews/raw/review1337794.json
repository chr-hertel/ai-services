Pat O\u0027Brien as Ritzy McCarthy gets ahead through a series of, unknown to him, fixed matches. His ego swells and a romantic triangle soon develops between the fighter, his wife-manager (Glenda Farrell) and Claire Dodd as the other woman. The New York Times reported that Pat O\u0027Brien was a former boxing champion at Marquette University and was trained for the film by boxer Jackie Fields. Also two former boxing champions, Mushy Callahan and Marvin Shechter provided opposition in the ring. The review followed this bit of information with the opinion \"All this impressive statistical work adds up to zero. Mr. O\u0027Brien and his various opponents in the film paw each other like long-lost brothers and some of the theoretical sleep-producing blows would hardly jar the script girl.\" The writer liked the picture overall though, calling it a \"rather pleasant prizefight film that follows formulaÂ…acted with some proficiency and humor by Pat O\u0027Brien and Glenda Farrell.\" Be on the lookout for silent era comedian Heinie Conklin as a heckler and \"Queen of the Hollywood extras\" Bess Flowers as a nurse. I screened this film at Cinefest in Syracuse, New York.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
