The opening sequences looks wonderful, with credits listed beside small, shifting squares of grainy film footage. The panoramic shots of Warsaw juxtaposing the old and the new were also beautifully realised. The light in Poland is exceptional for these kinds of shots and Porembny clearly understand this. The interiors were lovingly rendered, with the framing, lines and colours beautifully balanced and contrasted. My favourite little \u0027director\u0027s tag\u0027 was when the camera pans along the ceiling lights in the car park and then pulls down to reveal the figures of two men walking underneath them. \n\nIn another sequence red streaks of tail-light follow in a car\u0027s wake as it drives through the foggy night; it looks like mercurial dragon\u0027s breath. \n\nThe story is engaging without being enthralling and the acting is very solid, although it may have been more naturalistic if the performers were speaking in their native Polish tongue rather than English.\n\nAll in all, an extremely good piece of work from Edward Poremdny in his first feature film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
