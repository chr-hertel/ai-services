I had trouble sleeping because the movie\u0027s scenes kept playing through my mind, and then I woke up early and couldn\u0027t get back to sleep because I couldn\u0027t stop replaying the horrifically disturbing scenes of Aileen\u0027s life as a prostitute.\n\nI guess I\u0027ll comment briefly on Charlize Theron\u0027s performance--everybody else has. It was good, but not as great as I\u0027ve heard over the past couple years. Her facial make-up sometimes seemed like a mask that obscured her expressiveness, but then again, maybe she was playing it a little dead at times to show the numbness that Aileen sometimes must have felt. OK, I\u0027m not sure this will come out right, but I\u0027m just not really into the idea of a very attractive actress dressing down to play a rather non-attractive woman. In a way, and I don\u0027t mean to cheapen this by analogy, but it\u0027s kind of like blackface. Here we have Hollywood, where beautiful women get almost all the roles available, and out comes a movie with an amazing role that calls for a woman who\u0027s not the gorgeous Hollywood glamor type, and who gets the role? A gorgeous Hollywood glamor type. That\u0027s what I mean by the blackface comparison--it\u0027s a little like having a movie with roles for black actors and choosing instead to cast white actors with painted faces (although Theron\u0027s portrayal was not, in itself, derogatory, unlike blackface). It happens all the time--\"need an Arab? cast a dark-skinned Italian.\" In Monster, it\u0027s, \"need a woman whose life\u0027s pain has made its mark on her face and body? cast a woman whose face and body perfectly represent our nation\u0027s weirdly skewed ideal of beauty and then make her fatter and, pardon me, uglier.\" Just doesn\u0027t seem quite fair to me. Perhaps it has something to do with the Academy\u0027s penchant to give awards for this kind of role (think of Hilary Swank\u0027s role for Boys Don\u0027t Cry), and part of it probably also has to do with the fact that Theron was one of the film\u0027s producer.\n\nAnyway, the film made me feel ill, and that\u0027s a good thing in this case. I have a lot of trouble believing that there are so many men who would hire prostitutes along the side of the road (or anywhere else for that matter). Or, rather, I don\u0027t want to believe it, but I guess it\u0027s sadly not hard to believe. Even more broadly, I think the film is another scathing indictment of a wealthy society that cares so little about its poor, particularly its poor children. I\u0027m not so naively \"liberal\" as to agree that Aileen\u0027s character had no choice but to do what she did to survive, but I think it\u0027s painfully obvious that the choices available to her were fewer by many orders of magnitude than the choices available to me, or to people of the wealthiest groups in our nation. What can we do to open up more opportunities for the poor, and when will we do it? Good movie, although I hope I never see it again.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
