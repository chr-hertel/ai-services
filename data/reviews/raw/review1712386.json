I don\u0027t have right words", "reviewBody": "If you didn\u0027t see this movie, you never know what is worst movie ever published to humanity. Maybe someday in the future, someone make worst movie than this one, but I don\u0027t think, that will be soon in history time-line. Everybody need to see this movie, so your judgment of movies you see in the future, will never be so hard.\n\nI don\u0027t have words, for acting, scenario, directing, camera, and especially sound and music. Every word for this masterpiece is to good, too light, even those words I have in my mind right now, and those words are to heavy, so if I write here, probably Internet will crush.\n\nThis movie will never be worst movie in the IMDb, because it so stupid, so it can\u0027t win even in that contest.\n\nI\u0027m sad because on IMDb doesn\u0027t exist rate like -1. Damn -1 is too high, we need to make ratings -10 or less.\n\nSo people you must see this movie. When you see it, you will learn that you can take any camera, and make movie better than this, and who knows, maybe some of you become great movie maker one day. You should try, you can\u0027t make worst movie than this one!!!\n\nI won\u0027t spoil your fun, to watch this movie, so I won\u0027t write anything from it, or try to compare with some other movie. There is no comparison between any movie, and this one. Nice thing in this movie is his end!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
