The film masterfully depicts a much darker, more intense version of the famous legend. We are exposed to the complexities and inner workings of Bruce Wayne that ultimately cause him to take on the alternate identity as the city\u0027s masked hero. Bale does an extraordinary job in taking on the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne. He portrays the crusader in a more realistic fashion than past actors who have played the role. The rest of the characters in the film were also pretty well casted; particularly Gary Oldman as Gordon, who is not yet commissioner. It is especially interesting to see the origins of characters like Gordon in addition to how Batman came to be. Through this film we are able to see the background for the stories and villains we are used to. When attempting this, it is usually hit or miss. This film succeeded in all aspects and I recommend it to all fans of the legend or anyone who likes an entertaining movie. Well done. Let\u0027s hope if a sequel is made, it will live up to this film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
