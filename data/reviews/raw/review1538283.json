Plain and simple, it\u0027s a hilarious movie. While not the same as any of their other movies, if you liked them, you\u0027ll love this one. As a fan of alcohol, this movie had an even greater hilarity factor for me. However, even if you completely abstain from alcohol use...its still a great flick! \n\nI\u0027m not sure why it has gotten a 6.3 rating or so. It\u0027s completely undeserving of one so low, and is easily one of the funniest movies I\u0027ve seen in quite a while, and by far the best comedy to come out this year.\n\nSuper Troopers was the first Broken Lizard movie I saw, and it instantly became one of my favorites. I couldn\u0027t wait for Club Dread, and after seeing it, I didn\u0027t enjoy that one as much. However, after seeing it again a few times and coming to enjoy its completely random banter and quotes, it came to grow on me and I enjoyed it almost as much as Super Troopers. I just watched Puddle Cruiser for the first time a week or so ago, and while its clearly their first attempt at a movie and many things are lacking, its still a very funny piece of work.\n\nBeerfest jumped right into my top favorite movies with Super Troopers.
