The movie starts out on prom night, years ago. A prank-gone-wrong takes place in the attic of a high school involving a girl named Mary. The guys responsible for the prank assume her dead, and lock her body in a trunk. Cut to present day. A group of teenage girls are spending the night, having a slumber party, telling urban legends to pass the time, all leading up to the infamous \"Bloody Mary\" legend. On their third and final bloody Mary chant, the girls end up getting kidnapped by some jocks who are performing a revenge prank mainly on a girl named Samantha. They all return safely, a little shaken and confused after the bizarre event. But our main character, Samantha, begins having visions after the prank, mainly of Bloody Mary - and people start to die off. Is it all a joke, or is Bloody Mary back to take revenge? It\u0027s up to Samantha to uncover Mary\u0027s origins and stop the vengeful spirit.\n\nWhen I heard about this sequel, I was thinking \"Okay, okay - this might be decent\". And for the most part, it was. I saw the DVD at a local retail store and decided to buy it because I was curious. This film has nothing to do with the other two films at all, this one is much more supernatural rather than a slasher mystery. The acting was decent, not perfect but it passed. I enjoyed Lambert\u0027s \"Pet Sematary\" and I (unlike most people) enjoyed the sequel as well. The script for this film is predictable, the audience pretty much knows what actions the characters will take before they actually do it. The camera-work/cinematography was alright for a straight-to-video release, and the special effects were just okay, they unfortunately come off as a little bit corny in some of the sequences (especially the sequence that took place between Mary and the teenage boy at the motel). But hey, I wasn\u0027t expecting this movie to be perfect. The spider scene was actually pretty creepy looking, if not a little cheesy too. The deaths were quite creative and original, I\u0027ll give it that.\n\nTo sum things up, \"Urban Legends: Bloody Mary\" is a mediocre but semi-fun horror sequel. It\u0027s not great, it\u0027s really not bad. It\u0027s just somewhere right in the middle. I suppose it could\u0027ve been worse. If you enjoy supernatural revenge movies (along the lines of \"Pet Sematary\"), or if you like Lambert\u0027s previous work, you may want to check this out. It\u0027s flawed and predictable, but overall entertaining. There\u0027s no need to see the other two films though, because this one has nothing to do with them. 5/10.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
