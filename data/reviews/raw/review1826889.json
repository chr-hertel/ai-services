I couldn\u0027t help thinking that this film lacked the magic of the previous three films. One thing I noticed half way through the movie was the absence of Rambo\u0027s trademark knife. This for me was a major disappointment, it wasn\u0027t just a knife, it was a symbol more than anything which evolved as the Rambo films progressed. I was glad to see the return of the bow and headband, but the knife should have been there.\n\nApart from that the whole film was just mindless brutality, I really didn\u0027t have a problem with the violence, but it was the justification I had trouble coming to terms with. Rambo was immensely barbaric in this movie and most of the killing was unnecessary.\n\nThe story for me wasn\u0027t strong enough to hold the film. Something else I was displeased with is that there is no reference to col. Trautman, who was integral to all the Rambo films. His death should have been mentioned somewhere in the film or some sort of reference, but there was nothing.\n\nWhat made the action in the previous Rambo films so unique was the clever traps set in the jungles, none of which we saw in this latest installment of the franchise, I will say it again it was just mindless explosions repeating over and over.\n\nI was glad to see the reprise of Jerry Goldsmith\u0027s wonderful music, but it was the same theme playing over and over again. We never heard the triumphant themes which we are so familiar with, and the score just didn\u0027t have enough depth.\n\nlastly I have a problem with the title, it was initially going to be called John Rambo, than they changed their minds and called it just Rambo. Why not just call it Rambo 4, since that\u0027s what it is. Sly made the same mistake with the last Rocky film and now he is done it again here I really can\u0027t see the sense in it.\n\nOverall I just see this as nothing but a pointless action film!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
