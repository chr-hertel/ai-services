But Fernando Soler, playing an unusual role for him, shows off again his acting craft to the point that he makes it his picture too. Adopting an almost perfect northern (norteno) Mexican accent, he succeeds to show the danger and stupidity of \"machismo\". I wonder if in those days it was really welcomed or understood. And this is why movies should not be forgotten. If we forget history, we are bound to make the same mistakes. Maybe this sequel (\"no desearas la mujer de tu hijo\") was not necessary to make. But with the same dramatical, comical and musical ingredients, it turned out to be just as entertaining. I wonder why nobody cares so far to restore all these Mexican gems from the 40\u0027s and early 50\u0027s.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
