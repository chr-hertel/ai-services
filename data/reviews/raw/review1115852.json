Maybe the best performances of their careers by Caine and Connery and a gem by Plummer in the few minutes he\u0027s on screen. Plus cinematography that knocks your socks off. All wrapped around one of Kipling\u0027s \"ripping yarns\".\n\nThe idea of two sergeants setting off to seize a kingdom past the tallest mountains of the world in a land that may only be mythical is fantastic, but when you think of what the British accomplished in the 19th century with men just like this, it becomes plausible. Throw in the coincidences of Alexander the Great and the Masons, and it becomes a fabulous surprise.\n\nI\u0027ve seen it about 20 times and I\u0027ll watch it again any time.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
