The town starts getting over-run by vampires and all sorts of havoc breaks loose.\n\nThis is one of the GOOD Steven King adaptations. There are a few, but a lot of King stuff is being turned into garbage these days. If you don\u0027t believe me, read DREAMCATCHER then watch the film - you\u0027ll see what I mean. I\u0027m personally not a huge King fan, have read several of his books and seen most of the film adaptations, but the stuff from this time-frame really was good. SALEM\u0027S LOT has tons of atmosphere and the Nosferatu-like vampires are really freaky looking. The film\u0027s FX are a little dated by today\u0027s standards, but this can be overlooked. Definitely recommended for any horror/Steven King fan. 8/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
