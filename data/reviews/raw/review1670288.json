The escalating suspense to the bleakest ending. Every single second in these Hithcock films remains faithful to the entire concept. He was obsessed with birds and here we have them take over Bodega bay, their revenge on mankind. And they succeed. I love how his films start in one direction, like with Psycho, and then at some point take this tangent into an unimaginable direction for the leading characters in our film. The closer one examines this film the more one realizes how frighteningly excellent it is. The birds is an all time classic I could watch again and again. It must have taken a hell of a lot of patience to make such a film back then when there was no computer to aid special effects. And yet now today that we do have all the equipment, I can\u0027t think of who has the capacity to come up with a film of such a high calabre of genius. I would not be in the least bit surprised if they make the remake of this sooner or later. They have already done Psycho again unnecessarily.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
