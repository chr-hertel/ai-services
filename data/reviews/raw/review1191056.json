About two people in the strangest place...\"\n\nThis is a classic, rates right up there with \"My Mother the Car\", and stars Imogene Coca to boot!\n\nWhat about \"My Favorite Martian\" Another great old show that no one remembers, or the TV version of \"The Ghost and Mrs Muir\". Now there was a REAL dog.\n\nCheck out Frank Aletter to see where he went after this, and, of course Imogene was a star long before she accepted the role in this show (check out \"Your Show of Shows\" - a real groundbreaker.)\n\nDon\u0027t dis the old shows - I grew up with them and they all have their place in TV history. Much like the DuMont network and Jackie Gleason - if it weren\u0027t for them, God knows where we\u0027d be right now..... Then again, maybe we wouldn\u0027t be subjected to \"Reality Shows\" or \"The Gilmore Girls\" - two of the worst creations to hit TV since \"Ted Mack\u0027s Amateur Hour\"." }
