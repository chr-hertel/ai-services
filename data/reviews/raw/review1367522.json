I went into the theater out of loyalty to the series thinking it would be trash but discovered it\u0027s far and away the best in the franchise, not to mention the best movie to come out this year and one of the 10 best movies to come out in the past five years. J. J. Abrams works his magic in a masterful feature directing debut. Get up right now and go see this movie. The storyline is fresh, the action better than ever, and Abrams\u0027s film-making techniques reinvigorate a franchise in desperate need of it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
