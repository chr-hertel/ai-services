Johnny, however, is the only \"paying\" passenger on the train and she must protect him although her trigger finger is prepared for his first wrong move. Not being aware of her feminine side holds some hilarious moments as Grampa makes his best tactful effort (words not to be missed ) at a quick version of \"the birds and the bees\". While she doesn\u0027t quite understand, her chaperon, Pawnee (Chief Yowlachie), does and a large Indian with his own tomahawk is the perfect deterrent.\n\nThis train ride should be an easy ride for about 40 miles, but the tracks run out a few miles out of town, so they must carry the engine, cars and passenger over a mountain and fight off the stage line\u0027s efforts to stop. Soon they meet up with the tracks that run to Tomahawk. Along for the ride is a group of entertainers including Connie Gilchrist and a young Marilyn Monroe. Also in the cast are Walter Brennan as the train\u0027s engineer and Rory Calhoun.\n\nThis is a fun movie for anyone with a ticket to Tomahawk!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
