I heard that Ben Foster was in it, and I\u0027m a big fan. So, I started looking for it and any information about it.\n\nAfter reading the comments here, I realized the movie hasn\u0027t yet been released, even though it was supposed to be in 2003. I\u0027ve only seen the preview on a french website. I haven\u0027t heard why it hasn\u0027t been released? I\u0027m just wondering what\u0027s the hold up. It seems to be a really interesting film and I\u0027d like to know more. Can\u0027t wait to see it.\n\nAnybody?" }
