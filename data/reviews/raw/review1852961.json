Warner Bros\u0027. production explores the subject of open marriage way before it was popular. Brazen director, French Robert Florey accentuates the acute blend of delicious dialog, succinct script, on-point performances \u0026 sensual cinematography.\n\nHelen Bauer (Bette Davis at 25yo) is a sexy, fashion illustrator. Don Peterson (Gene Raymond at 22yo) is an advertising executive who\u0027s proposed marriage to Helen; but, she initially refuses not wanting to give up her independence. Much to the chagrin of Helen\u0027s overly moralistic father, Adolphe Bauer (Alphonso Ethier), the unwed couple is obviously having a live-in sexual relationship. Had this film been released later, these sexual aspects of an unwed relationship would\u0027ve been censor-able due to the Hayes Code.\n\nWhat\u0027s more, after Miss Bauer eventually becomes Mrs. Peterson, Helen\u0027s reluctance to marry comes across like the woman has intuition, when her husband begins a sexual flirtation with the bored, flapper wife, Iris Van Hugh (Claire Dodd), of his alcoholic business rival, Hugo Van Hugh (Frank McHugh). When Helen tries to platonically date a handsome rouge, Nick Malvyn (Monroe Owsley), he unsuccessfully attempts to make an adulteress of her! \n\nSeveral examples of delightful dialog make my points plain:\n\nDon (Raymond): \"I\u0027m just about fed up with sneaking in...let\u0027s get married so I\u0027ll have the right to be with you.\" Helen (Davis): \"What do you mean \u0027right\u0027? I don\u0027t like the word \u0027right\u0027.\" Don: \"Let\u0027s not quibble about words.\" Helen: \"No, I\u0027m not quibbling, \u0027right\u0027 means something. No one has any \u0027rights\u0027 about me, except me.\"\n\nHelen soft \u0026 sincerely conveys what Bette Davis believed: women are men\u0027s equals. Part of the reason such films appeal(ed) to Davis\u0027 audiences so much is because she portrays empowered women. Helen \u0027says without saying\u0027 that she has the \u0027right\u0027 not to get married \u0026 enjoy her sexuality, too (in 1933!).\n\nWhen Helen (Davis) says: \"I don\u0027t want babies,\" Davis commented later in her life (1971), there\u0027d be fewer divorces if couples didn\u0027t marry simply to have sex \u0026 babies. If her point, that couples who get married ought to do so because they are very strongly committed to one another, hasn\u0027t been socially adopted in the US yet, \u0026 couples still wed for moralistic reasons, Davis\u0027 Helen conveys a higher moral reason for marriage: a feminist one that holds very heavy weight today, since equality between women \u0026 men is all the more prevalent, as this early 20th century dialog reveals:\n\nDon (Raymond): \"You\u0027re a successful woman; I ought not to like it.\" Helen (Davis): \"You\u0027re a pretty successful man; I ought not to like it.\" Don \u0026 Helen simultaneously: \"I\u0027m a man!\" \n\nAs usual, Bette Davis\u0027 unique set of physical \u0026 verbal expressions convey a woman\u0027s power; this time without disempowering her man. This remains her appeal to women \u0026 men: as a woman\u0027s role model who is eventually actualized \u0026 an independent woman who men do love. In this sense, Bette Davis\u0027 characters, as role models of empowered women, have far reaching effects upon changing the social status of women to be equal to men and reveals that men do like it." }
