I thought it was just a one time funny thing; how wrong was I. After that part the movie just turned into a mistaken comedy, and keep in mind this was only like 25 min into an 110min movie. Pretty much Cage goes on a god dam rampage, pointing guns at unarmed women, jacking some womens bike, riding the bike looking like Mr.bean. And the top it all off near the end of the movie when he realizes his kid is still alive and is gonna be sacrificed he walks down stairs into the tavern and really and i mean really clocks this women named sister BEECH. Honestly sound that out, just say it out loud, what does that does like so you, son of a beech. The whole movie you hear this name and you can\u0027t help but laugh abit. Anyways after he punches sister Beech in the face and TKOs her, another girl comes in and jumps on his back, he then flips her over and punches and kicks her right into a wall. It\u0027s funny cause they look like milk maids. Then takes sister beeches bear suit to get his kid back at this sacrificial festival (they are going to burn her alive because they believe she cursed their crops)all these people have stupid ass costumes too, really funny to see. Cages kid is tied up to a pole and everybody is standing far back, and all you see is this guy running in a bear suit towards this kid. Then after that he finds up he has bin set up and he turns out to be the one that they want to sacrifice. So as they capture him he says\" Killing me won\u0027t bring back your god dam honey\" and then (Snap)\"MY LEGS\" really funny you have to watch it. Basically if you want to go see a thriller don\u0027t see this movie nobody can take it seriously, but if you wanna see comedy well then my friend you can to see this movie cause nothing fits right with it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
