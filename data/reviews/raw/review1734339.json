If this sounds bad or uninteresting to you, then so be it, but if your into head cracking shoot-em up carnage and crazy OTT gun play then rock on.\n\nThe plot is familiar (cops, undercover double-crossing cops, triads) and not terribly well played out, the character interaction is a little confusing and sometimes stays into weird, but this is made up for 10 fold in the high octane gun battles, of which there are many.\n\nWhether its Tequila descending on a wire into a warehouse full of armed thugs with a shotgun and grenades, or a load of motorcyclist gunmen spraying a drug factory with Uzi fire, or even 2 guys with an endless supply of bullets shooting their way out of a hospital leaving a trail of bodies which could fill a morgue, this film does not disappoint on the violence front. Grittily shot and low budget, this is still John Woo\u0027s finest film, and nothing else has come close in terms of sheer blast for blast action.\n\nTo be watched when you think YOUR country\u0027s cops are heavy handed!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
