Santa (Bill Goldberg) is the son-of-Satan and is out to scare children after a thousand years of imprisonment. he is killing for no other reason then to kill. Standing in his way is the man who imprisoned him to serve the children, Grandpa (Robert Culp) and his grandson Nicholas (Douglas Smith).\n\nFor some odd reason, Santa finds the oddest way of killing people: lighting people on fire with coal, choking them with a wreath, or just running them over with his reindeer. For two hours or so we watch two stupid teenagers run around and hide, finally leading to a rocket launcher blowing up a reindeer. \n\nIn the end I was just like WTF. I was confused, lost, and a little humored by the movie. The fight scenes with Goldberg are pretty cool and sometimes he does act well. In the end, the film doesn\u0027t make any sense, it\u0027s stupid, but it\u0027s pretty funny when you don\u0027t care what you\u0027re watching. Seeing Goldberg actually try to act is hilarious but some of his lines did make me laugh and in the end did give a convincing performance. The best was the giant reindeer. that pulled his sled. \n\nIf you watch it, don\u0027t expect a masterpiece, actually don\u0027t expect much at all. Just watch it for the action, not the story. \n\nSanta\u0027s Slay. Starring: Robert Culp, bill Goldberg, Douglas Smith, and Emilie de Ravin.\n\n2 1/2 out of 5 Stars.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
