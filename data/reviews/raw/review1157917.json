THIS MOVIE IS THE REAL THING.. with all the excitement, the despair, the dirt and the hilarity connected with it. 24 hours in the life of a group of heroin addicted guys in Rome suburbs. Most of the cast was composed by actual or former drug addict by the time the movie was being shot, and the director had an hard time as often some of his actors ended up in jail during the shooting.. The main character and other actors died of aids in the years after the release of the movie. You won\u0027t find in here anything but real life, nevertheless this is the most poetic, dramatic, realistic, funny and truthful movie ever made on the subject of drugs. the acting is amazing, the director does his job well and the soundtrack is \"in tune\" with the overall movie feeling.
