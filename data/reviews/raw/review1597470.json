It\u0027s dark, it\u0027s depressing, many character relationships, and a lot of old favorites (like Amuro, Char, and even Katz) unite under the same banner. \n\nA New Translation refines and gives glory to the aging series, for a new generation. As discussed in previous posts, much of it got a nice face lift, but allow me to summarize what to expect (along with my sole gripe).\n\nThe series primarily opens and follows the path of Camille, a young boy driven by his emotions. Living under the opening oppression of the Titans, Camille steals one of their prototype gundams (the MKII), and is recruited by the Anti-Earth United Government (AEUG). It is here that we begin seeing familiar faces. All characters suffer and witness many hardships through their battles and grow stronger in their commitment and abilities (mainly Camille developing his Newtype abilities). \n\nHaving seen the original episodes that correspond with the movie, I can tell you not much has been left out or changed. A few scenes are shortened, and the ones left out feel more like a deleted scene extra that many DVDs have. Also, only one major plot point was delayed until later but it still eventually occurred. My only gripe is that things do begin moving faster and faster, but not enough to get lost (until III, which I\u0027ll comment on as well). \n\nIf you\u0027ve seen the original Zeta, definitely pick this up, it\u0027ll be nostalgic seeing it in modern glory.\n\nIf you\u0027ve seen other gundams, but never Zeta, be hesitant. If you\u0027re still enthusiastic about seeing Zeta, try movie I, and if it interests you, pick up the rest. If this route is taken, be prepared to look up additional summaries and FAQs as the trilogy progresses (I do believe MAHQ has the original Zeta episode summaries). \n\nIf you\u0027re new to anime and wanna see a gundam after something you saw on Cartoon Network, do NOT begin with this, you\u0027ll be beyond lost. Try watching the UC gundams in their time line order: 0079 (original trilogy is very good), 08th MS Team, 0080 (my personal favorite), 0083, then Zeta, ZZ, Char\u0027s Counter Attack, and if you\u0027re still feeling excited, V. \n\nIf you\u0027re not into anime, why would you even be reading this?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
