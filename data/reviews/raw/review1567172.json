Right from the start, the comedy is pathetic...\n\nThe movie has some illogical steps like a school dropout is made to be a student to pass out 10th..with the assumption that anybody who passes 10th can be traffic constable. ileana after her great role in pokiri (and great looks), looks like a dirty damsel in this. She acts as a teacher and the way she dances (in heroes dreams) but still not expected from an actress who wants to make a name for herself.\n\nRaviteja was doing some good movies, but if he continues doing movies like this, he might have to return to being a side actor.\n\nTotally waste movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
