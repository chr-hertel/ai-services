The movie wastes no time in getting right to the thick of things, and it took me a while to realize there wasn\u0027t going to be a big storyline to this movie. It simply was a look behind the scenes at the final showing of Prairie Home Companion\u0027s radio show.\n\nAfter watching the movie, I had to drive over to Mickey\u0027s Diner in St. Paul and eat a late-night meal in the same booth the characters sat in at the end of the movie.\n\nThis was a pretty good watch. It was a solid, heartfelt, sometimes charming movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
