A host of other big names fill the bill including Morgan Freeman as The Boss (because he\u0027s the boss), Sir Ben Kingsley as The Rabbi (because he\u0027s a rabbi), Bruce Willis as Mr. GoodKat (the professional assassin), and the beautiful Lucy Liu (girl next door) as the female lead.\n\nA smart-mouthed Slevin finds himself in the middle of a war between two crime bosses, The Boss and The Rabbi, but Selvin\u0027s \u0027I\u0027m-not-the- guy-you\u0027re-looking-for\u0027 bit gets lost in translation to all except the flirtatious Lindsey (Liu), who offers him help.\n\nThroughout this fast paced movie the viewer will be totally captivated, yet a bit oblivious to the significance of some of the characters and key events. The film\u0027s conclusion, however, proves that very few things are what they seem. The creative writing of Jason Smilovic and Tarantino-esquire directing of Paul McGuigan turn this \u0027drama\u0027 into a refreshingly witty and intense thriller.\n\nAlong with its energetic soundtrack (including 1964 Stax Classic, After Laughter Comes Tears by Wendy Rene) and eye-catching production design, moviegoers will love Lucky Number Slevin\u0027s enigmatic essence and quirky humor.\n\nIt is dreadfully bloody, incredibly sexy, very funny, and EXTREMELY clever." }
