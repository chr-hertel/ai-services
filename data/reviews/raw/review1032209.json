Then he really finds himself as London is subjected to a plague of zombies.\n\nDifficult to fault any of the performances in this film and the soundtrack is well judged, but the main pleasures are in the visual gags and some superb one liners. My favorite among the former were the early scenes showing the deadening nature of Shaun\u0027s everyday life and a later scene where Shaun\u0027s party, seeking to find refuge at a local pub, encounter a party led by his ex-girlfriend. The groups are mirror images and greet each other as if they were at a vicarage tea party!\n\nThe ending works well, though some may find it tasteless. It is at least consistent with the rest.\n\nRecommended, unless you\u0027re put off by gore or strong language. Rating: 7/10.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
