I know this because I\u0027ve watched this perennial holiday classic countless times. It never fails to hook me into Valentine Davies\u0027 short story. From his perch, seven stories up, Santa is on the precipice of sanity. Some people consider him a touch crazy. Who else would list his \"next of kin\" (on his employment application) as eight reindeer from The North Pole? Is he nuts? No. Well, maybe a little: \"like some of those men in Washington.\" Natalie Wood, a tiny power plant of a child, doesn\u0027t think so. She is mesmerized by the charming old man with a snowy white beard. But she\u0027s not totally convinced. Yet. Her mother, you see, has hammered away any thoughts of make believe. No fairy Tales. No giants--except in the Macy\u0027s Parade. And fantasy resides in a place better left unvisited. A child (I think) needs a little world of their own, a place where parents are banished, and where a fantasy world is cracked open like a colorful Easter egg. I enjoy John Payne\u0027s kid-friendly, but ambitious lawyer. He butts heads with Maureen O\u0027Hara, Wood\u0027s overprotective mom, on several occasions. Natalie Wood\u0027s performance is nothing short of brilliant. Timeless. And so is this wonderful movie. If you think I\u0027ve short changed the plot and some of the plethora of memorable moments in the film--forgive me. You will find them on the DVD, nestled in your Christmas stocking. Kris told me so.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
