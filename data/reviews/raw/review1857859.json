You know there is too much violence here towards good people just like bad attitudes towards the good actors but i also want to say some things i like about these series, good play of Lena Headey and Thomas Dekker reflecting the misunderstanding between parents and teens, two different generations and one more thing i just cant help sharing personally i think Lena Headey and Summer Glau are really very sexy and beautiful women, one of them is clever and the other one is very strong :) good wishes!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
