The whole idea behind it i.e. snuff films is one of the most frightening urban legends (?) ever existed. The beginning is very scary, but as the film goes on, it becomes obvious that both of them will survive. Anyone who is really into thrillers should be disappointed with the evolution of the film and especially the end, where the guy raises his head and comes out of the coma in a second. And of course, no one would believe the trick with the screwdriver into the car...what nonsense! Any decent thriller with this theme, would end like this : both of them try to get out of the room, scared to death and finally, the guys get them and kill them and tape them. Oh, i forgot! always the stupid kissing and fondling and eternal love thing in these American films. When there are 3-4 guys running after you to kill you, you don\u0027t remember to kiss your wife and re-conciliate.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
