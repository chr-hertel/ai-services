That is until a computerized fight sequence between Balboa and current champion Mason \"The Line\" Dixon, ends with Balboa winning, now with nothing to lose, Balboa risks it all to go the distance. I was really looking forward to Rocky Balboa in many ways (After I saw the trailer, at first I was cynical)and this movie delivered everything it promised. There are of course some flaws, such as some of the secondary characters are underwritten (I would\u0027ve liked to see this go longer, believe it or not) and some of the subplots are either dropped or solved too quickly to truly pay off but once you see Rocky run up the steps and see Rocky make his entrance in the ring, it\u0027s nearly impossible not to smile. Another flaw is, I would\u0027ve liked to see a longer training montage but overall this is a fitting finale and I for one was glad to have seen it. However I still prefer Rocky 1 and 3 over this particular chapter. Still I can\u0027t wait for the DVD release.\n\n* * * out of 4-(Good)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
