Good acting too, except for P. Postlethwaite, who hams disgracefully.", "reviewBody": "Despite her misgivings about renting a scummy old apartment, recently divorced Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly), moves in, because her young daughter, Ceci (Ariel Gade Â– excellent) is very taken with the dump. In fact, Ceci has been possessed by a spooky spirit, which lives there. Gradually mother and daughter are drawn into a murky world where past, present and supernatural intertwine. Ultimately the intertwining is slightly disappointing for this viewer, but the journey is worthwhile. Director Walter Salles who\u0027s already made a strong impression with Central Station and The Motorcycle Diaries, is expert in his handling of mood and psychological mystery. Not so much a thriller or a shocker, more a gradual immersion in foreboding, unease and filthy water. Most of the supporting cast is excellent.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
