I enjoyed it immensely. It has been described as an action-adventure-romance-sci-fi pic and it truly is all of that.\n\nFirst of all, the cinematography was stunning. Tony Scott and his DOP, Paul Cameron, do fantastic work -- every shot is beautifully composed. And all the footage that involves a cast of thousands (meaning the crowd scenes) is masterful work.\n\nI don\u0027t know why I started with commenting on the photography (also the editing) of this movie. It\u0027s probably because that is what struck me from the very beginning, particularly when there is so much going on in the opening sequence. Yet you never get lost. Above all, the performances and story are great and really suck you in. Yes, this movie requires a fair bit of suspension of disbelief. I would go so far as to say the plot was far-fetched, but the heart of the story just takes you along for the ride.\n\nFor the record, I felt Scott\u0027s most recent teaming with Denzel, Man on Fire, was one of the best movies of 2004. I don\u0027t think Deja Vu is as good as Man on Fire, but it\u0027s right up there as one of the most entertaining and thrilling movies I\u0027ve seen this year.\n\nFor sheer entertainment and an intriguing (though not flawless) plot, Bruckheimer, Scott and Co. sure have DELIVERED the goods.\n\nI recommend you see Deja Vu on the big screen with a big, loud audience for maximum enjoyment. Part of the appeal last night was exactly that; hearing the audience -- as one -- laugh, applaud and sigh along with this movie and getting swept up in that communal experience.\n\npost scriptum -- Any fans of Otto Preminger\u0027s wonderful 1994 classic Laura may be delighted by the echoes of that storyline in Deja Vu.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
