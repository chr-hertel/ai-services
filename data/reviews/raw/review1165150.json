So far this is the best mini series that I have seen in years. If the next ten episodes are as good as these two, then I will rate this series right up there with Roots, Centennial, and Lonesome Dove. I guess that dates me somewhat, doesn\u0027t it.\n\nI agree with all of the other many positive comments on this series. There are still people out there who enjoy intelligent programing, instead of all these mindless sitcoms and reality shows. I too am a history buff, and enjoy the authenticity that this series projects to the viewer, as opposed to just more Hollywood glitter like that abominable \"ALEXANDER\"." }
