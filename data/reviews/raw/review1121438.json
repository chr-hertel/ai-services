Luckily, my fear proved baseless. This movie is as stupid and hilarious as described; in fact, in may even be more so. I have never seen a performance as hilarious as Shatner\u0027s in this movie - not even in a comedy. We get to see him threaten a park balloon vendor with bodily harm, followed by an informative diatribe about the contents of a commercial hot dog. And that isn\u0027t even when Shatner goes really crazy! The only thing we don\u0027t see Shatner do is lip-sync a famous song in spoken word; maybe that\u0027s just part of some long-lost footage. Every scene with Harold Sakata is hilarious, as well. He just seems to show up randomly in the middle of the movie, as if the director found him wandering around town and then wrote in a part for him on the spot. And Ruth Roman\u0027s performance reminded me of an Elizabeth Taylor diamond commercial on acid. If this movie ever does make it to DVD, my greatest wish would be for an informative \"making of\" featurette, but alas, my wish is for naught, for I know Shatner would just as soon bury this one as talk about it openly. I\u0027d really love to know what went on when filming this, as I have a hunch that the backstory would be highly amusing. As it is, I exhort you to lie, cheat, or steal to find a copy of this. You will not regret it!!\n\nRecent Update: I was right! Shatner mentions the making of the movie in his autobiography by describing how he saved Sakata\u0027s life while filming Sakata\u0027s hanging sequence. The support underneath Sakata malfunctioned during the scene, so Shatner had to hold Sakata up with his bare hands to keep him from choking - actually breaking one of his thumbs. A true gentleman." }
