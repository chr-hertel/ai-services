The suspense is high from the get-go, with Lola\u0027s boyfriend Manni phoning her to say that if he doesn\u0027t get 100,000 deutsche marks within 20 minutes, a gangster will kill him. Immediately, Lola sets off running through Berlin in a frantic attempt to locate the money. The fun part is that we see Lola\u0027s journey three times with three very different outcomes, determined by little things that happen to Lola as she runs.\n\nLola (the engaging Franka Potente) manages to be both an iconic, super-cool heroine, and a believable young woman who just wants to get her boyfriend out of trouble. IMDb ratings show that this is the rare action movie that appeals to girls more than to guys, probably because Lola is such a strong character. \n\nThis is exhilarating film-making, with a propulsive soundtrack, a fast pace, and many flashy effects like animated and black-and-white sequences--in addition to the most stunning use of split-screen that I\u0027ve ever seen. Incredibly for such a young director, these techniques are employed with great assurance. I also like how although the film is \"hip\" and sometimes amused by the crazy things that happen to people, it\u0027s never cynical. Instead, there\u0027s a sweet optimism to it, a faith in karma and love.\n\nOccasionally, \"Run Lola Run\" is a bit too clever for its own good. The rapid-fire montages that show the fates of minor characters are superficially amusing, but unnecessarily hammer home the theme that \"little things can have a huge effect on a person\u0027s life.\" However, the movie\u0027s philosophies are still ambiguous enough that there\u0027s a lot to think about when it\u0027s over. Furthermore, \"Run Lola Run\" is an extraordinarily good time; it\u0027s impossible to take your eyes off the screen whenever Lola\u0027s on it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
