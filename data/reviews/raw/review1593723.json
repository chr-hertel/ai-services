To tell you the truth, \"Vampires\" looks like it\u0027s trying to be trashy. Specifically, it looks almost like Carpenter got a bunch of people together to party, they filmed it, and added a bunch of gore in post-production (I admit that I just made all that up as I thought about it).\n\nBut anyway, this movie is a pretty amusing romp, as James Woods leads a group of hunters trying to stop a centuries-old vampire (Thomas Ian Griffith) from finding a relic and becoming fully immortal. None of the overwrought pomp from \"Bram Stoker\u0027s Dracula\", just pure unadulterated fun; absolutely no pretense whatsoever. Definitely the sort of movie that you watch with best buds. Also starring Daniel Baldwin, Sheryl Lee, Maximilian Schell and Tim Guinee.\n\nBack when Sheryl Lee played Astrid Kirchherr in \"Backbeat\", who would have ever guessed that she would later star in a John Carpenter movie?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
