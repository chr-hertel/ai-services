Ala a previous Aussie classic film Picnic on Hanging Rock.\n\nIt\u0027s gritty \u0026 frightening in basing it\u0027s story on the crimes of the backpacker serial killer Ivan Milat \u0026 the Falconio murder.\n\nIt\u0027s takes time to develop it\u0027s characters as believable young free spirited travellers.\n\nIt builds the tension in subtle ways with lights flashing across the faces of the uncertain, naive faces. Before confronting us with blood, gruesome suggestions \u0026 the terror of the victims.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
