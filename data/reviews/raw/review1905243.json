However, I really enjoyed Sixth Sense and the Village and so on reading the reviews - some good, most bad - i decided to believe the \u0027you must have missed the point\u0027 reviews, mainly because i know people who didn\u0027t like the village. I was sorely mistake, this movie is a complete **** up - the script/acting/camera work are all bad. It was like watching a film made by high school students on their parents video camera.\n\nI gave it three based on the fact thats its a marginally interesting idea, terribly realised.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
