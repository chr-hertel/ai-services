The story lines, the actors and of course the Ravens make for one of the best teen dramas in years. Originally OTH was just supposed to be a made-for-TV movie called Ravens focusing on the basketball team. of course, and the love. lies, and messed up lives of the people surrounding the team. However it was so well written and interesting it was turned into the mega hit One Tree Hill, and thank goodness it did because, really, we need something to occupy us while we are waiting for The Oc to come on AND it is an awesome, fun, interesting show that will be enjoyed for years to come and only seems to have growing fan base as the season go on." }
