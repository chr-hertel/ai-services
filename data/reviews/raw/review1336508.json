Better than Firewall!\n\nAnt \u0026 Dec rise from Saturday night television to star in a quaint British film that shouldn\u0027t have you laughing hysterically but will have you smiling. It\u0027s probably the best way to have revealed the \u0027true\u0027 story about the alien autopsy. \n\nTrue, you can never forget that Ant \u0026 Dec are Ant \u0026 Dec, but it doesn\u0027t detract from a thoroughly enjoyable film. If you\u0027re as gullible as the thousands who got sucked in by the original autopsy footage then you\u0027re probably the type who will be sucked in by the mistaken reviews that have already peppered IMDb. Don\u0027t be sucked in, go see this film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
