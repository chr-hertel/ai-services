The movie is not that great and it\u0027s not that bad too.\n\nHrithik was \u0027THE\u0027 highlight of the movie. His dance, acting everything that included him was awesome. Of course some stunts which were very unnatural but still it\u0027s Hrithik.\n\nSeeing Abhishek act and dance after Hrithik\u0027s song was very funny. I felt they let Abhishek down in this movie... I mean may be Hrithik outcasted him. Aishwarya is great as always and all others are pretty normal and did what they expected. The movie over all is a timepass to watch.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
