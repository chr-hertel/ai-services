All these years later at 37 and I had no qualms hiring it on DVD. Great entertainment for all ages. And what about the song The Rainbow Connection? See:\n\nWhy are there so many songs about rainbows And what\u0027s on the other side? Rainbows are visions, but only illusions, And rainbows have nothing to hide. So we\u0027ve been told and some choose to believe it I know they\u0027re wrong, wait and see. Someday we\u0027ll find it, the rainbow connection, The lovers, the dreamers and me.\n\nWho said that every wish would be heard and answered When wished on the morning star? Somebody thought of that, and someone believed it, And look what it\u0027s done so far. What\u0027s so amazing that keeps us stargazing And what do we think we might see? Someday we\u0027ll find it, the rainbow connection, The lovers, the dreamers, and me.\n\nAll of us under its spell, We know that it\u0027s probably magic...\n\n... Have you been half asleep?

Someday we\u0027ll find it, the rainbow connection, The lovers, the dreamers, and me.\n\nLaa, da daa dee da daa daa, La laa la la laa dee daa doo...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
