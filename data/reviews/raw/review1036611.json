Wrangler, who hasn\u0027t been this good since Barbarian Queen II, takes us inside the character so deeply that we can\u0027t help but feel for the \"Tim\" in all of us. I did some research and was quite surprised to see Wrangler snubbed by the Academy in 1998, despite his fine work here.\n\nMark S. Porro is also strong as the career-oriented anchorman whose philandering has led him to the conclusion that he\u0027s had real happiness in his grasp the whole time. And what can I say about the character of Ron? A recovering alcoholic stand-up comedian passed off brilliantly by rising star Phil Palisoul, Ron is at first the comic relief in this hilarious slice of life, but we get to know soon enough that he\u0027s got problems of his own. \n\nJerome Courshon and Steve Rifkin round out the cast superbly as Trent and Drew, the Artist and Musician who feel looked down upon by their wealthy friends. if only they knew, both possesses the kind of freedom Tim and Alex (Porro)have longed for... \n\nIn closing, this is not one to be passed over. Often we as consumers spend hours looking beyond the new releases for that one gem that fell through the cracks. Look no further. God, Sex and Apple Pie is a true piece of cinematic genius.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
