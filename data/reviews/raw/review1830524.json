Um....yeah. I watched this film once a few years ago and hated it but I watched it in Italian without any subs so I gave it another try with subs but they didn\u0027t help. Needless to say this is a very disgusting film that really doesn\u0027t have anything going for it. The idea is an interesting one but the 110 minute running time really kills this. D\u0027Amato could be a great director but this here wasn\u0027t one of his high points. The follow up Erotic Nights of the Living Dead is better." }
