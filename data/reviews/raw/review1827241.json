This film is a remake of the 1931 movie The Man in Possession but since I haven\u0027t seen that one I can\u0027t compare the two. From what I\u0027ve read this version was watered down due to the Hayes Code and that comes off true watching the film because Harlow\u0027s sexuality tries to get displayed but the screenplay keeps it at a distance. Another problem in the screenplay is that it comes off rather lazy and doesn\u0027t feature anything very original or funny for that matter. The whole joke in the second half has Taylor acting as the Butler and we get several childish jokes, which just don\u0027t work. Harlow sleepwalks through her role but then again she isn\u0027t given too much to do. Taylor doesn\u0027t come off any better and Una O\u0027Connor is wasted in her role." }
