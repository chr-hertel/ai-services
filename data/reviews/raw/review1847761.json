I think the movie did it\u0027s purpose..entertaining,it\u0027s just bad that some of the actors didn\u0027t want to get past they unknown status and so just Griffin was acting in his grip-laugh character like way.I gave this movie a better mark than it deserved simply because this is not by far a 1 movie,you should check out \"lake placid 2\" for that ! I was pleased to see so many nice cars in one place and a nice soundtrack ! No other racing ,cars-like movie got too much better so i think it\u0027s just a genre that doesn\u0027t excel on acting but gives good (nice) FX and a bit of good looking girls and cars of USA .\n\nRent or buy the DVD !", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
