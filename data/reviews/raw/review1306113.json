I love everything of that movie, especially the song Baba Haji Ali and Mehboob Mere with Susmita Sen, she was wonderful. I saw the movie 20 times. Its a Family movie you can watch it with your hole family (issat). Karisma and Jaya Bachan did also a great job she was so fantastic, the role of Fiza suite Karisme Kapoor very well. \n\nKeep go on Mister Khalid Mohamed..\n\nI cant wait to see your next movie..\n\nGreets from Holland..\n\nMohammed Khalid Jahangier Ashrfi", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
