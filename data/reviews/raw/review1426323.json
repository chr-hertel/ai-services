What struck me about this film is that it\u0027s directed by a woman. Which is very odd because you would\u0027nt think a lady would know much about hooliganism, much less be interested enough in it to make a spectacular, brutal movie such as this. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire ride. But this film also has a message, particularly for Americans. There is much more going on in the world than you think there is, and in England...Europe in general, football is not just a game. It\u0027s life...and if you can\u0027t respect that, than don\u0027t go to England.All in all, I think this movie is great and deserves much praise, and many more awards than it\u0027s gotten.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
