Rodriguez does all three of these stories justice, they\u0027re all dark and very intense. i do wish the stories would have come together a little better in the end, but i am satisfied with the payoff. best movies so far this year, but episode 3 and batman are right over the horizon.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
