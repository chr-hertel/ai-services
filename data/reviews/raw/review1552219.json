Although Adam made that at the beginning of his career, not at his peak like Will Ferrel. This movie had so much potential that was wasted. The french guy could have been hilarious, instead it was disgusting. That had to be some of the worst acting I have ever seen. Once again the trailer is better than the movie. Thanks Hollywood! Take my advice, don\u0027t waste your time. I need to make ten lines of comment but there is nothing more I can say other than this movie is horrible. So I will just say this, anyone who gave this a high rating is just an immature twelve year old who will laugh any time someone says the F-word or something that is nonsensical and loud. This movie is probably loved by immature twelve year olds.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
