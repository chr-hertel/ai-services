What a great movie! Knowing little about the movie production, I thought the singing was dubbed and were surprised to learn that the actors were actually singing throughout the show.\n\nSince I have no idea of what Phontam and Christine should have been, I felt that the cast members did a great job portraying each character. The movie brought the story close to me. The vocal part for all the actors and actress were just fantastic. I was even more surprised to find out that this is the first musical that Gerald Butler was on and he has done such a superb job. I hope to see future musical productions from Gerald, and Emmy of course.\n\nI went back and listened to the sound track recorded at London and concluded that the movie version is different - more real and less theatrical and better.\n\nI have been and will continue to recommend this movie to my friends and people I know.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
