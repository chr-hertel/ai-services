A well acted and superbly written piece of TV heaven. A slice of Northern Life in the late 80\u0027s. Many of the actors featured have gone to to good TV careers. It must be a favourite of Victoria Wood as she has used at least 3 of the actors. Gained a cult following when first shown. It consisted of 5 1 hours episodes. Never been repeated since (to my knowledge) Not available to buy in any good video shops (or rubbish ones) Favourite character was called Kenny. Favourite line (from Kenny) \u0027i was lying earlier when i said i\u0027d had 3 shits today. I was just trying to impress you. I\u0027ve only had one\u0027.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
