As I recall it did not get particularly good reviews, but became quite popular with the younger art movies audience of that time. However, I found it to be one of the most boring pictures I had ever seen. It fact, I believe that it is one of the few pictures that I ever walked out on. The acting was so superficial and the story so predictable that I ceased to care what happened to the two main characters. Its attempt to portray a rather sordid 19th century love affair between a circus performer and a married army officer as an innocent romance between two young lovers just did not work for me. One scene after another scene followed in a predicable sequence with no imagination or surprises. The only thing that saved this picture from obscurity was the lovely second movement of Mozart\u0027s 21st piano concerto. What I regret the most is that one of Mozart\u0027s greatest composition has been saddled with the title of \"The Elvira Madigan Concert\". What a travesty to have this magnificent composition identified by the title of this rather shallow and superficial movie." }
