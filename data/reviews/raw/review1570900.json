It took a hard look at how even in present times the seemingly fantastic fairy tale can still be couched in reality.\n\nAmazing performances as well as amazing scenes. I can\u0027t shake some of the horrific scenes out of my head. Captain Vidal is quite possibly the worst screen villain in recent memory, in contention with Ralph Fiennes\u0027 Goethe from Schindler\u0027s List. \n\nIt\u0027s so scary, sad, funny, and creative. Best use of CGI I have scene in film. Not overdone, it meshes with Del Toro\u0027s camera tricks and lighting creating an environment that at once seems both frightening and inviting.\n\nA definite must see for anybody who loves fairy tales and even for those who think they don\u0027t.\n\nI went into this movie having very low expectations, I mean, it\u0027s in Spanish, I was basically expecting a Spanish Harry Potter, but instead I got a Spanish Sin City mixed with Alice in Wonderland and Schindler\u0027s List.\n\nAMAZING!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
