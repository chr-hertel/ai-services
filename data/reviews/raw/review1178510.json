How can Samara now fly around and pull people into televisions? Why is she showing up and harassing the pair? They already did their part and watched her weak-ass VHS indie flick and made copys, what else do they need to do? Plus, Samara somehow comes out of the videotape when Naomi burns it and gets inside the TV? I thought she would only make an appearance if someone actually watched the tape?? That being said, you could assume that the tape in the 2nd Ring has now become pointless and Samara will just simply become any old normal ghost that haunts people. Wow, good job sticking to the catch of the story...this movie was a waste of time and effort.\n\nI really wonder why the hell Naomi and whatever the hell that kid\u0027s name is even decided to do this movie? Did they read the script, with the f\u0027n stupid mad-deer-disease scene and all, and then say \"Yeah, sounds good, I think it will do well.\" How much were they paid for this? Must\u0027ve been a lot. Not like I really had an high expectations for this in the first place, thank god I did not see this in the theater.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
