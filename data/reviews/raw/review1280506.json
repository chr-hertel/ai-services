It was the same ****ing plot line as Red Eye but people kept buying tickets, why? The film was uneventful, uninventive, predicable and forgettable. A \"strong\" female main character running around a plane crying for an hour and a half is not my idea of a great movie. The acting was even worse than the creativity of the writers and directors. I just didn\u0027t buy into the story and/or feel sympatric for the characters, the acting and the dialogue kept reminding me that it was a movie and I had wasted nearly $10 to see this movie. And again just like Red Eye, Flightplan tries to use gimmicky camera shots or effects to create emotions or suspense in the audience (i.e. running down the aisles of the plane in slow motion). Hollywood blames low movie audiences on DVDs, piracy on the internet or the economy, but I blame the Hollywood idiots that write, produce, act in, and celebrate terrible movie like Red Eye and Flightplan. PLEASE, DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! And if you think you must see this movie, wait until it\u0027s at the library, rent it for free and give your $10 to charity instead of the Hollywood Idiots, don\u0027t encourage them to make another terrible waste of time and money.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
