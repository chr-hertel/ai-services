Both are nearly perfect and, for once, I have NO CRITICISMS WHATSOEVER about either film.\n\nWell, HIS GIRL Friday is a remake of the fine film THE FRONT PAGE. However, bucking a general trend, this film is definitely better than the original, as it is jam packed full of energy and snappy dialog. Just listening to the dialog between Grant and Russell is something to behold! I really think if they slowed down the film to normal speed, it would last about 30 minutes longer! But, despite its blistering speed, it works great. Watch and laugh--it just doesn\u0027t get much better than this.\n\nBy the way, there are several wonderful inside jokes in the film. The first, and the funniest, is when Cary is describing his ex-wife\u0027s boyfriend to someone. He\u0027s at a loss for how to describe him and finally says that the guy \"looks like that actor,...Ralph Bellamy\"--and the guy playing the boyfriend IS Bellamy!! Then later, Cary is talking about a guy he knew named \"Arichie Leach\". Archie Leech is Cary Grant\u0027s REAL name! Cute touches like this, combined with the lightning-fast pacing, wonderfully overlapping dialog and general kookiness make this a MUST-SEE. Amazingly enough, Grant\u0027s comedies BRINGING UP BABY and ARSENIC AND OLD LACE are even better--if it\u0027s possible!!! See them all--you deserve it!!\n\nBy the way, IF you can find a decent copy of THE FRONT PAGE (1931), it is well worth seeing and almost as good as HIS GIRL Friday. However, be forewarned that many DVD and videotapes are public domain copies that are unwatchable due to serious volume and print problems.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
