What a stupid film!!! I can\u0027t believe those stupid dialogs can be deep to some people...!!! The Vol.1 was somehow funny but this one is a Truly Terrible film!!!\n\n\"The venom of a black mamba can kill a human in four hours, if, say, bitten on the ankle or the thumb. However, a bite to the face or torso can bring death from paralysis within 20 minutes. Now, you should listen to this, \u0027cause this concerns you. The amount of venom that can be delivered from a single bite can be gargantuan.\"\n\nHA HA HA...!!! Incredible...!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
