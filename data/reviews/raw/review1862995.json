Extracted from Exodus, the second book of the Jewish Torah and the Christian Old Testament - the story of how Moses led the enslaved Israelites out of Egypt and through the wilderness to Mount Sinai (after crossing the Red Sea).\n\nThe Prince of Egypt is one of the greatest animated films of the last 20 years, because it achieves what many of the classic Disney films did; it translates love, passion, story and song so beautifully through the characters and the settings. This is very much a great classic; in strange way it is reminiscent of the old Cecil B. DeMille studio epics such as \u0027The Ten Commandents (1956)\u0027.\n\nVisually breathtaking, featuring the Academy Award Winning song \u0027When you believe\u0027 sung by Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, The Prince of Egypt is entertaining and still manages to inform.\n\nA formidable achievement.\n\n9/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
