The quality of the filming done in video recording due to low budget cannot show in its full extent the beauty of the emptiness. The non-actors are the villagers themselves, none of them younger than sixty and with a magnificent sense of life and charm besides the situation. No one could have gone deeper in their feelings and transmit such a peaceful sensation at the end. First feature film of a promising Spanish female director who happens to have been born in the village where the film is shot" }
