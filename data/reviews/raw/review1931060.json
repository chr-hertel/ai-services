It brings up a lot of interesting subjects and surprised me in that early on it is made clear that this is not a movie about making overweight women feel proud of themselves. It also doesn\u0027t really answer any questions about weight issues today - what it does is make you think: about how you view yourself and how you view other people, and this includes the overweight as well as the underweight. And yet still it was about so much more. I had the pleasure of meeting cast and crew at Cinequest in San Jose and this was one of my favorite films of the festival.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
