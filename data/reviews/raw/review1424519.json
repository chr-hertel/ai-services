Seen more as a tribute to classic horror films such as The Werewolf(Lon Chaney) \u0026 Dracula(Bela Legosi), \"Van Helsing\" just does not have the \"bite\" that hardcore sci-fi/horror/adventure fans love. The performances of hunk Hugh Jackman(X-Men) \u0026 Kate Beckinsale(Underworld) are mediocre at best while Richard Roxburgh as Count Vladislaus Dracula stole the film. David Wenham(Lord of the Rings) provided some comedy relief while the rest of the cast seemed to fade into the scenery. \"Van Helsing\" will please some, but the most fickle of film goers will scoff at the acting performances \u0026 cheesy storyline.\n\n\"Van Helsing\" chronicles the adventures of Gabriel Van Helsing(Jackman), Vatican orphan \u0026 monster hunter. Upon an unsuccessful mission in Paris to capture Mr. Hyde(Robbie Coltrane), Van Helsing returns to the Vatican to meet with Cardinal Jinette(Alun Armstrong) for his most important mission ever. With bumbling friar Carl(David Wenham) by his side, Van Helsing travels to Transylvania to destroy the fiendish Count Vladislaus Dracula \u0026 loyal assistant Igor(Kevin J. O\u0027Connor), who plans to unleash his offspring onto the world to feed. In order to complete his evil plan, Dracula must have Dr. Frankenstein\u0027s monster\u0027s energy in order to bring his vampire babies to life. After fighting off Dracula\u0027s brides \u0026 the Werewolf(Anna\u0027s brother, Velken),Van Helsing, Anna, \u0026 Carl attempt to hide Frankenstein\u0027s monster from Dracula \u0026 his minions. They are attacked by the Werewolf \u0026 Dracula\u0027s brides, escape, but Van Helsing is bitten by the the Werewolf. To make matters worse, Anna is kidnapped \u0026 taken to Dracula\u0027s castle \u0026 Frankenstein\u0027s monster is captured. Van Helsing \u0026 Carl successfully save Anna but are over matched by vampires.\n\nNot discouraged, the three heroes find a way to follow Dracula to his remote stronghold to save Frankenstein\u0027s monster \u0026 the world from certain doom. With a torn piece of a magical painting \u0026 his mystical ring, friar Carl finds out how to kill Dracula \u0026 the way for Van Helsing to do it. Since bitten by the Werewolf, Van Helsing will turn when the full moon rises \u0026 will be able to destroy Dracula. Dracula owns the potion to rid Van Helsing of his curse of lycanthropy. But first, three have to get the antidote from a well-guarded room in Dracula\u0027s castle. Once the three are transported to Dracula\u0027s castle, Carl \u0026 Anna get the antidote with Igor\u0027s help \u0026 Van Helsing goes after Dracula. Once transformed into a werewolf, Van Helsing battles Dracula to the death. Van Helsing triumphs, thus destroying Dracula\u0027s offspring. Tragically, Van Helsing attacks Anna and kills her while she attempted to inject him with the serum. Van Helsing \u0026 Carl burn her body in proper fashion on a great mountain near her village. Van Helsing, grieving Anna\u0027s death, looks on to new adventures.\n\nNot a bad flick but has too many low points. Jackman \u0026 Beckinsale work okay together but have no romantic chemistry. Only great CG \u0026 scene-stealing Richard Roxburgh keep this film afloat. Give \"Van Helsing\" a look but do not expect a lot.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
