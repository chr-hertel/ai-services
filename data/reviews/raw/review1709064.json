A few facts have been exaggerated (in the sense that they may have not happened exactly the way the movie shows), Greatorex\u0027s screenplay doesn\u0027t seem to have left out other important facts to make it a \u0027Hollywood story\u0027. Though at times, the screenplay seems a little slow, it does allow one to grasp an idea of what the war must have been like then. Though in the technical department the film may seem a little outdated, the background score really stands out and the ending is superb.\n\nThe actors fit their parts well. Among the famous faces you\u0027ll see the likes of the immensely talented Michael Caine and Christopher Plummer. However, the film doesn\u0027t solely belong to them as it\u0027s a collective effort from all actors.\n\nI find many of the recent war films to be too dramatic but \u0027Battle of Britain\u0027 has a certain rawness to it that makes it more realistic. One really feels for the character without being forced to do so. I think it\u0027s a well told story and especially those interested in history and like war films should go for it." }
