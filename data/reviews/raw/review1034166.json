I loved the \"East Bound \u0026 Down\"theme song, I love the silly chase scene\u0027s, I love the quirky C-B talk, I even love the way actors played these characters( it was almost as if they Burt, Jerry, Sally \u0026 Jackie were all born to play these roles- because I cannot imagine anyone else in any of those roles - I hope they never do a remake) --- this is an American classic -- I don\u0027t care that the AFI,Movie Critics and the Oscar crowd will never except this as a masterpiece - personally I\u0027d would rather watch Smokey \u0026 The Bandit 100 times before I\u0027d watch \"American Beauty\", or \"The English Patient Once\" ! ! ! ! --- to hell with the critics! ! ! Smokey and the Bandit is an American classic whether they like it or not ! ! ! A-men! !", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
