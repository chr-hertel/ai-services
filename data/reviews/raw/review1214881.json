Not a good idea for a movie--not even for a soap opera--though it does give Supporting Oscar winner Margaret Rutherford a jaunty opportunity to kick up her heels as a befuddled Duchess, and Orson Welles nearly steals the show as an egotistical filmmaker. Reteaming of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton post-\"Cleopatra\" doesn\u0027t ignite sparks, but they are gorgeous together. Polished production does pick up after a slow start; it\u0027s professional but inert, and mostly unexciting. Directed by Anthony Asquith, who might\u0027ve been dozing behind the camera. ** from ****", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
