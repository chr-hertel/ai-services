Apart from the pitch-perfect casting, incredible script, whatever else, what strikes me most about this movie is there is not one ounce of cheese, over-the-top emotions, or a single line of dialog that doesn\u0027t seem 100% natural. You get everybody\u0027s viewpoint, even the bad guys. Nobody (not even the villains) are self-absorbed. I LOVE IT!!! At least I thought explaining \u0027batman\u0027 and his costume etc in today\u0027s time was going to be silly, but no. I buy everything. More!!! Oh yes let me order now those 70-80\u0027s batman comic books, they had the same spirit. I have a bad memory, which is why it probably isn\u0027t true, but I seriously can\u0027t think of any better movie ever made right now. As a side note: everybody thinks Katie Holmes was the only bad casting decision. Well I don\u0027t. The point is that in this movie, the love interest does not take center stage, and it is rather a completely believable, normal relationship as it could happen in real life. Why do all superhero movies have to pretend to be a super-sized love story as well? See?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
