Paul Walker plays Joey, who has to get rid of some dirty guns used to kill some dirty cops in a bust that went bad. Joey hides the gun but a few hours later his neighbor is dead and the 10 year old son who is playmates with his own son, has disappeared, with the gun. What follows is the most intense two hour movie i have seen since Pulp Fiction. i honestly have never seen a movie like this. The \"parents\" and you\u0027ll know what I\u0027m talking about when you get to that point, scared the crap out of me. What twisted f**ks. This movie is really, really good.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
