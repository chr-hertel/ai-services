The dialog is as awkward as the staging with none of the actors at their best.\n\nSYLVIA SIDNEY is passable as the distraught wife, a role she would go on to play in countless other films, but she can\u0027t save the short from being impossibly dull. LYNNE OVERMAN as her husband is convincing enough but the whole project was doomed from the start with a lifeless script.\n\nSumming up: An early talkie is a depressing look at hard times.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
