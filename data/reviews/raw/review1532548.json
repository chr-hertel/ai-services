I\u0027m now 17! How\u0027s that for being memorable? I admit that I haven\u0027t read the book even now, though I have read Great Expectations so it can\u0027t be said I don\u0027t respect Charles Dickens. People shouldn\u0027t rate this movie so hard if one, you\u0027re not a child, and two if you are a hardcore fan of the book. Anyways.. I just thought I\u0027d get that out of my system and if anybody knows where I can possibly buy the DVD please let me know! Also, I should let some of you fans out there know that the picture they have for this movie isn\u0027t from the movie as we can all remember it involved cats and monkeys, not people.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
