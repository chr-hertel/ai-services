I had never heard of this movie and I thought it would be OK at best but it was wonderful.\n\nI have chosen quite a few \u0027friendship\u0027 movies to watch with my niece and they often let me down with content that either isn\u0027t suitable or is too young, but this handled issues that she and I could relate to restfully. For example, who knows what exactly happened with Bridgette on the beach, I was happy that my niece supposed that they \u0027french kissed\u0027 and it was left as if this is all that may have happened.\n\nA beautiful movie well worth watching!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
