Great cast relationships. Great stories. Great actors. Each time I watched it I thought to myself, \"I should tape this.\" But I never did because I thought it would go on for many seasons. I can\u0027t believe the show was canceled. Each episode dealt with a different \u0027unjustice\u0027 to someone and Mr. Chapel brought justice to them in the most inventive, entertaining ways imaginable. All done with no guns! Added to the writing was Mr. Madsen\u0027s great personality and humor. Kathleen York as his sidekick was superb. She brought a bit of tension to the mix as you never knew what she would do on her own. Please, is there anyway we can get this series released on DVD? Who do we petition?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
