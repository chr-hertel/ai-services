John Malkovich was his usual mesmerizing self. The only problem I had with this movie was Julia Roberts, who to this date does the WORST IRISH ACCENT EVER!!! So I think it goes without saying that while Julia is a very good actress, she can\u0027t do Broadway or accents! If it were not for Julia, I would have scored this film much higher. I would have like to see someone more able in her role. Perhaps Kate Winslett, or heck even Gweneth Paltrow! Julia was truly out of her depth in this film and it shows. She lacks confidence and in some scenes appears to be bored by it all. I\u0027m glad I saw this on video instead of paying full price at the theater!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
