Matthew (Michael Pitt), a young American who\u0027s there to study French, spends most of his time at the Cinemathèque Française, where he meets fellow film lover Isabelle (Eva Green) and her twin brother Thèo (Louis Garrel), who let him live with them. Once Isa and Thèo\u0027s parents are out of town, the fun begins: games, debates and arguments about movies (from Chaplin to Godard, from Sam Fuller to Howard Hawks). Then the three youngsters decide to bring their relationship to a more, uh, intimate level...\n\nMovie-buffs are gonna love the first half of the movie, where the protagonists\u0027 (and the director\u0027s) love for classic films is visible in every frame (the debate about the greatest comedian ever - Chaplin or Keaton - is brilliant), while in the second part the sex takes over, though still connected to cinema (the first sex acts are punishments for losing a homemade movie quiz), and it\u0027s pretty graphic lovemaking indeed (but what would you expect from the man who gave us Last Tango in Paris?)...\n\nA very interesting and well acted movie, although it\u0027s slightly disappointing that Bertolucci doesn\u0027t give us more than a glimpse of the riots which should have had a more important role, given the time and place the story is set in. Other than that, The Dreamers doesn\u0027t seem to have any significant flaws.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
