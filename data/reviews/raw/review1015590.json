I go to the local video shop and see titles that might interest me. I come back home, before I rent, and come on to IMDb and read reviews to, hopefully, get a true reflection of the movie. If ever I have been given a bad reflection, it is with this film. This is a low budget T.V. movie. Nothing more, nothing less. Not a bad movie. But I could have waited until it was shown mainstream. I hope it was very loosely based on a true story, because the credibility was just not there. I would hasten to add that I hate reviews that go on about the cinematography etc. etc. etc. All I want to know is \"did you enjoy the movie\". My final comment is, watchable movie, not completely a waste of time, but wait till it\u0027s on television, and catch it, or don\u0027t. You won\u0027t miss too much." }
