It had the best acting of any Kiwi film I\u0027ve seen in a long time and there were some really great scares and twists! The second half of the film, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. And the ending completely blew me away!! The 1930s sets and costumes all looked authentic and I never would have guessed that the film was made on a relatively low budget. Also the music was the best I\u0027ve heard from any film in ages. It was beautiful but also really scary when it had to be. All in all, this is one of the best thrillers I\u0027ve seen in a long time, not just from New Zealand but anywhere. Though if you don\u0027t like getting scared, it may not be for you.\n\nReally recommend it!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
