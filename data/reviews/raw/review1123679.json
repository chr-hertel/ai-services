Lenny kills Tommy - and he is insane. Kutcher kills Kelly and he is crazy too. Absoulutly another destiny. Do you remember when he is in jail and goes back to school in order to make scars on his hands for Carlos. And nothing changes, he comes back in to future and he is still in jail. How come? I think everything should have changed. His mother would consider him completely crazy and would probably send him to some other school and he would never become a fraternity guy. Come on guys, I don\u0027t think you believe that it is normal if a kid impales his hands on nails in school. Would be very glad to hear your comments on it." }
