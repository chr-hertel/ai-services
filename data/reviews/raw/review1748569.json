It\u0027s soap opera. That being said, it rings true and captures the tone and angst of small-town, middle-class America, which is the backbone of its culture.\n\nAnd the show is beautifully shot.\n\nActors don\u0027t have to worry about hitting their marks in what feels like an artificially stillness in most shows. Rather the camera chases the story and captures the emotion as if it were unfolding right before our eyes through a fractal of hyper-realism.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
