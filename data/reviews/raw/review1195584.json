What I especially didn\u0027t expect is a Cameron Crowe movie that feels so much like pieces of other movies.\n\nThe opening vignette of corporate rise and fall has a few amusing satiric touches of cubicle life in an entrepreneur\u0027s ego-driven company, but feels hastily retooled from the internet bust to an athletic shoe company and is too dependent on the annoying, voicing the obvious, voice-over narration. This part is too much like the weak \"Just Like Love\" or even too obviously striving to re-strike the opening of \"Jerry Maguire.\"\n\nThe \"meet cute\" vignette establishes immediately that Kirsten Dunst\u0027s flight attendant is just plain annoying and continues to be so as we learn nothing more about her. Just that everyone loves her and her occasional southern drawl immediately (at least at the only there for silly comic relief wedding party) and she\u0027s a prescient, controlling know it all so that the maybe\u0027s of their relationship only seem based on her psychic abilities and not their developing chemistry, and there\u0027s no suspense about it. Their extended phone conversation courtship was done better in \"The Truth About Cats and Dogs.\" Even the teens behind me got fed up and muttered that she was \"an idiot.\" At least in \"Junebug,\" which was also centered around a family\u0027s bland golden boy returning to the south, we got insight into the preternaturally peppy woman. As long as this film is rated PG-13 for some reason, more could have been made of the romance.\n\nThe family gathering in the titular town stoops to some stereotypes as it\u0027s like a southern mirror image of \"Avalon,\" and the lost big city guy in the small southern town seems a lot like \"Doc Hollywood.\" But the contrasting father/son/grandson conflicts around Cousin \"Jessie\" (Paul Schneider of \"All the Real Girls\") are so natural, despite a buffoonishly conservative Loudon Wainwright as the dad (despite that so much of his own oeuvre is about these same father/son issues) and the mystery of their wives, that he seems to be in a parallel, better movie. Too bad Crowe\u0027s boomer musical tastes make the cousin a Lynyrd Skynyrd fanatic as that doesn\u0027t make a lot of sense for such a young guy (and greatly confused the teens in back of me who didn\u0027t get a single older musical reference so missed the significance of a slapstick funny \"Freebird\" climax though it uncomfortably recalled a recent tragic accident).\n\nWomen\u0027s role in such get-togethers is portrayed affectionately. Susan Sarandon\u0027s brief comic appearances start out seeming just oddly silly but turn into a gutsily sweet and funny facing down of a family that always saw her as an outsider, though the modeling message that was supposed to be conveyed to her son about romance was a bit muddled. Just that this must be at least the fifth movie recently that considers the song \"Moon River\" some kind of touch stone.\n\nIt is amusing to have some family members note in passing just how handsome Orlando Bloom is, as he doesn\u0027t add much else to the film. At least his accent only slips once.\n\nThe closing road trip is a music version of the Americana kitsch journey in \"About Schmidt.\" I wish that Crowe would do a separate documentary about his musical free association from Kentucky to Memphis and west as it would work better on its own and I would love to see that. Yes, the music selections are terrific, except when they are too distractingly obvious and familiar, such as Elton John, U2 and Tom Petty, and I did want to be able to take in all the selections on the mix CD that we barely glimpse (including an inside joke of listing a Rufus Wainwright song in a notebook that looks just like the one in the teen remake of \"Cruel Intentions\") and hear, as it was nice to hear Ryan Adams, My Morning Jacket and Eastmountainsouth. Evidently the 18 minutes eliminated from the rough cut shown at the Toronto Film Festival were from this section and now it just feels jumpily confusing and not at all revelatory about Bloom\u0027s character. What does he learn about himself by visiting the Lorraine Motel, Sun Studios and the Second Largest Farmer\u0027s Market other than boogying badly? The seconds of nostalgic flashbacks to connect the past with the present aren\u0027t quite enough emotional grounding. Combining a musical journey with an inner one made more sense in \"Schultze Gets the Blues.\"\n\nCrowe wonderfully captured \u002790\u0027s young people in \"Singles\" and nostalgically those of the \u002760\u0027s in \"Almost Famous,\" but his insights just don\u0027t seem to flow out of these young folks.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
