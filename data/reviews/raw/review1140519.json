It\u0027s about a good-hearted girl and how she tries to affect people\u0027s destiny. It\u0027s so charming, so full of color that it delights the eyes, funny, quirky - it just makes you want to smile. It\u0027s romantic without being cloying. I just watched it for the second time two nights ago, and it put me in such a great mood the next day. It presents the sort of world where you might want to live. So often, we see people who do things for their own gain, who use deception to cheat people, those who no longer care about others around them, and we\u0027ve gotten so used to being wary all the time - and often, it\u0027s reflected in entertainment, it\u0027s so nice to see someone who delights in trying to make people happy and to improving lives, just for the sake of creating pleasure in other people, just because she sees an opportunity to do so. This is not warm and fuzzy in the usual way, where the saccharine nature, the predictable lines all get wearying - it feels so fresh and new, and yet, so much like a fairytale too. It\u0027s difficult to explain. I didn\u0027t get the full gist of it until I saw it myself.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
