It just wasn\u0027t funny at all. It was awful, absolutely awful.\n\nAlthough, little (3 year olds) like this movie, so it\u0027s a nice thing to have on hand to waste two hours of your little kid\u0027s life...if you feel willing to pay $10 to get it.\n\nMy advice: don\u0027t see, get or rent this movie.\n\n1/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
