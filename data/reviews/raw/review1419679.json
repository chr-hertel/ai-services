The most notable thing about the film is the fact that it features a leading performance from the great Humphrey Bogart. Bogart\u0027s personality has always been more than a little bit over the top, but it often isn\u0027t too noticeable. For some reason, however, it really sticks out in this film; but it somehow fits the dialogue like a glove, and the feel of this film is very much in the true classic style of noir. The plot is pretty standard, and follows Bogart\u0027s character; an ex-paratrooper, who is looking for a friend of his that disappeared after being accused of murder. However, he gets more than he bargained for when he hooks up with his friend\u0027s mistress, \u0027Dusty\u0027 Chandler. The atmosphere of the movie is dark and mysterious, and this blends brilliantly with the brooding plot line. The film manages to pull in many of the standard noir elements; best of which is the femme fatale; excellently brought to life by Lizabeth Scott. Overall, Dead Reckoning is a very good example of the film noir style of film-making, and while it\u0027s not one of the \u0027must see\u0027 films; it\u0027s certainly well worth bothering with.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
