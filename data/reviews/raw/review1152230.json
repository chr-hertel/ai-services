Had they shown more of the Satanic ritual or whatever, it might have been creepier, but as it stands now, this is a waste of time and brain cells. Is anybody else getting sick of the whole \"little kid drawing creepy pictures with crayon\" thing? Could there possibly be a bigger horror clich√©? Probably not. I know, I know, it\u0027s from some different country, and it\u0027s far too refined and sophisticated for me to understand, so I shouldn\u0027t expect the \"plot\" to be spoon-fed to me, blah, blah, blah. Whatever. I still say the movie blows.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
