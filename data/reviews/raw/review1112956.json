While Tool\u0027s music has certainly gotten more eccentric, their videos have always been more abstract than the music itself. I would have never been able to think up the visuals Jones created for the Undertow tracks, which seem almost TOO bizarre and surreal for those songs. However they both end up complimenting each other so well, I can\u0027t recommend people see their videos. It\u0027s a damn shame they\u0027re so short, it\u0027s also even more discouraging that Adam Jones hasn\u0027t just made a full length, with a soundtrack to his film by the aid of his own band. I remember seeing the Sober and Prison Sex videos around 93 / 94 and I was highly captivated by the very similar stop motion style of Jan Svankmajer. Adam Jones seems particularly inspired by his surrealistic interpretation of \"Alice in Wonderland\", called \"Alice\" or \"Neco z Alenky\". If you are a fan of the disturbing, nightmarish stop motion creativity of Jones, it\u0027s a sure bet you\u0027d be a fan of Svankmajer\u0027s works, especially \"Alice\" and \"Faust\". These videos are classics and highly recommended.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
