I love the Predators and Aliens and all the movies except this one. I was looking forward to this movie and saw it first show on Christmas day. The Predators are cool, the Aliens are cool and the Hybrid is a new twist, Other than that the acting was horrible, just downright terrible. I will not bother with spoilers, don\u0027t waste your time with this one wait for it to go to DVD. I can not believe how horrible the acting was, I was tempted to walkout but stayed in the hopes it would get better, I should have listened to my instincts. Sorry to say all this, I am a fan of this series and was horrified more with the crappy acting than the action on screen. Steer clear of this one in the theaters and see something else. Thats my 2 cents.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
