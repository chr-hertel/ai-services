The first is a narrative about a bunch of truly uninteresting and useless personalities who work in a hotel. The other is a collection of film clips from the RFK campaign. Putting the two of these together could have been a good idea. In this case, it results in nothing less than a disaster and travesty, which insults us the audience, and even worse, it immerses RFK into the worst kind of soap opera trash. It\u0027s an insult to all concerned.\n\nI gave this film two stars, instead of zero, because of the film clips, and Laurence Fishburne\u0027s acting, which almost saved the character he was playing. In all honesty, it\u0027s been a long time since I\u0027ve seen a film this bad. Furthermore, I lived thru the 60\u0027s, and this film does nothing whatsoever to capture the atmosphere of the times. The doper scenes are caricatures. There\u0027s no tension whatsoever, either between the characters, or about the politics of the day. Believe me, 1968 was anything but a dull year. People were truly freaking out. The whole country was falling apart. From this film, we\u0027re led to believe that the biggest crisis of the day was a dullsville hotel manager cheating on his wife, and an alcoholic lounge singer.\n\nWhat were the people who made this garbage thinking?\n\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\n\nWell, that\u0027s the review I wrote immediately after seeing this film. However, upon further reflection, I\u0027m having a very different take.\n\nParticularly irksome was the casting in this story. It\u0027s all big names. In fact, it\u0027s totally topheavy. This is most annoying. \"Oh, there\u0027s the Hobbit!\" \"Oh, there\u0027s the West Wing!\" \"Oh, there\u0027s Morpheus!\" If a Hollywood film has two of these people, that\u0027s normal; they\u0027re balanced by the lesser known actors.\n\nBut these are not stupid people. So it dawned on me; this is exactly what they wanted to do. This is not really a film about RFK, or the assassination, or the Ambassador Hotel. It\u0027s a political statement from Hollywood. Laurence Fishburne\u0027s Uncle Tom routine has nothing to do with the story line; it\u0027s seriously out of whack with the politics of race of the day. That\u0027s clear. This also explains why none of the subplots ties in at all with the assassination. They\u0027re not supposed to. I kept wondering what the heck the Czech reporter had to do with any of this. Now it\u0027s clear. She was there to show that tho the message is anti-right establishment, but they\u0027re not Commmie Pinkos, the traditional retort of the conservative right. And that stuff about the CHADS! obvious in retrospect.\n\nThis film is an in joke. It\u0027s a message from the Hollywood elite about how little we\u0027ve progressed, and how off track politically and socially we\u0027ve become, how we\u0027re still embroiled in stupid wars, racism, poitical duplicity, etc. That\u0027s the only explanation that makes any sense to me. These are not stupid people. Taken at face value, this film is nonsense.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
