I seriously don\u0027t know what the heck happened. It is kind of like a modern day opera, but the music is really bad, and the acting is very weak. I\u0027m really not a fan of R Kelly or rap music in general, but the lyrics in this were really poorly written, and the whole thing had one repetitious beat in it. I honestly don\u0027t know why anyone would want to put the effort into making this - did someone down the line actually read the script and think it was good??? I also thought it might have been made as a joke or something.\n\nI\u0027m giving it a generous 3 out of 10, just because I feel people should see it for themselves just to see how weird it is.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
