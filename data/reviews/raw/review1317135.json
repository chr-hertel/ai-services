That much I say without thinking on the matter twice. The film is well animated as well as being well written and well orchestrated in the sense that the music is so crisp and perfect for the film\u0027s setting. The film\u0027s setting takes place in Edwardian Europe (possibly England) where a young man named Victor Van Dort is to be married to a young woman by the name of Victoria Everglot. The two do not know each other and are sent to a wedding rehearsal where Victor, afraid of the marriage (and the Pastor\u0027s cane on his head), messes up his lines and goes out to say them properly, but mistakenly places the ring on a branch in the ground which he thought was a branch. It turns out that the branch is actually the Corpse Bride, who thinks that Victor has married her. It seems he is in an impasse and doesn\u0027t quite understand what to do... With all of its subtle humor and often lively chutzpah, this film is a good one for all ages, old, young, or otherwise...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
