I\u0027m only writing this because I am so angry that the broadcasters saw fit to show this truly dreadful film. The story was impenetrable and the acting made it worse. I don\u0027t think that I\u0027ve seen a film where the lead actor and actress seem in such different worlds to each other. No chemistry or anything else. Terence Stamp looked bored and the others made zero impact, I\u0027m afraid. Were we supposed to be scared, excited, intrigued or what?? Can\u0027t write any more constructive or destructive comments, the film really doesn\u0027t deserve it. Deadful waste of time....silliest film ever!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
