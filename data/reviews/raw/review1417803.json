Instead one is on an adventure and character study in the life of Julian, the \u0027facilitator of fatalities.\u0027 Finally there is a big commercial project in which Pierce Brosnan can showcase his comedic instinct coupled with his portrayal of an emotionally unavailable and very confused hit-man. The two opposites could not work for anyone else except the former Mr. James Bond who was the epitome of class and savoir faire. And because Brosnan was widely viewed only as \u0027Mr. Bond\u0027, Mr. Brosnan was never seen as a legitimate actor in the fullest sense of the word. His talent and instincts shine as the guilt-ridden, emotionally-overwrought Julian who is as enigmatic as he is transparent. Brosnan\u0027s timing and comedic sense present the viewer with a wonderful cinematic gift. Who else could have you routing for a hit-man in the declining years of his \u0027career?\u0027 Of course on the other side of the screen is the vastly underrated Greg Kinnear. His sense of timing and emotional bonding (no, not James Bonding)to Julian allows Kinnear to give us glimpses of a soon-to-be middle-aged man who decides to extend his caring to his new friend Julian. Kinnear\u0027s ability to play complex emotions and in the very next instant be the straight man to Brosnan\u0027s antics is classic. The chemistry between the two keeps the viewer wanting more. And to this smart director\u0027s credit, he leaves it that way. When the final credits roll, you want more of these happy, tortured lives but you can\u0027t have it because that is the stuff smart, catchy films are made of.\n\n\u0027The Matador\u0027 is a cold, crisp Margarita on hot summer\u0027s day that,as you take the last gulp, leaves you asking, \"No Mas?\"", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
