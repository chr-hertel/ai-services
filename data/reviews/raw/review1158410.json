I was lucky enough to catch a preview, and all I can say is, it\u0027s brilliant. The writing, the cinematography, everything-- every single second of the movie is refined to the very last bit. I laughed while crying, cried while laughing-- easily, EASILY, the best movie i have ever seen in my life. Unfortunately-- I\u0027m going nuts not talking about it, as it defies most conventional movie rules-- talking about it too much gives it away, but suffice to say-- amazing even self-contained, but all the more amazing if you\u0027re a fan of the show.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
