I love Bacall. I love Chandler. I love Philip Marlowe.\n\nI used to think I loved The Big Sleep. I used to TELL people I loved The Big Sleep. But tonight, ten or fifteen years later, I don\u0027t love it anymore.\n\nThey all seem to have memorized their lines that afternoon, right before the shoot. There is almost no reaction to each other, and I mean everybody. They talk too fast, as if they were copying the \"ambience\" of His Girl Friday, which was already \"dated\" about ten minutes after filming.\n\nThis is not acting. This is Pushing Them Out, at maybe the rate of ten or so per year.\n\nThe screenplay is a mess; it seems to have been re-written a dozen times by a dozen different people. I can\u0027t believe William Faulkner had something to do with this screenplay, but they claim he did.\n\nBut there IS something to love about this film. It\u0027s the cars.\n\nThis movie has the greatest cars of any Forties b/w film. Has Jay Leno seen this movie? Somebody call him and clue him in. These are terrific cars in this movie. I think I\u0027ll watch them again.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
