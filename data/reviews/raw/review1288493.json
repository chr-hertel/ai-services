Yep, those were the days, back when I found myself glued to the television, eagerly watching and awaiting the newest episodes of shows like Star Trek: The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, The X-Files, Earth 2, Sliders, The Outer Limits, and NBC\u0027s Seaquest DSV.\n\nSeaquest caught my attention for three particular reasons: the premise of an undersea world was immensely appealing, the series was being executive produced by none other than Steven Spielberg, and the star of the show was one of my favorite actors, Roy Scheider. With all these ingredients, I just knew this was going to be a sci-fi classic and given how undemanding a sci-fi fan I was back then, this show won me over from the start. Watching season 1 again, it\u0027s a bit tougher to imagine why I was so fond of this show in the first place.\n\nCertainly, there\u0027s a handful of bright spots to be expected. Scheider, as always, does a great job of playing the fatherly authority figure/everyman role that I\u0027m sure he\u0027s grown used to. The f/x and sets, very \"90s\" in look and style, were quite impressive for its time and are still passable enough today that they don\u0027t often distract the viewer. The series even occasionally delivered its share of high adventure and mild suspense. I also liked John Debney\u0027s main theme, which is actually kind of catchy.\n\nBut the series never came together like it should have. From the start, Seaquest was clearly aping ST: TNG, what with the UEO/Federation parallels, the captain/ship\u0027s doctor romance, and the brilliant but annoying teenager who served no other purpose than to draw in a younger demographic (even though Jonathan Brandis, RIP, was a better actor than Wil Wheaton, I still found Lucas far more irritating than Wesley Crusher).\n\nThis would all be perfectly forgivable if the show actually delivered on its fantastic premise. Unfortunately, Seaquest is cluttered with too much vanilla-bland writing and cheesy dialogue. Seemingly 3/4\u0027s of the episodes attempt to deliver an important \"lesson,\" but this tends to come off as self-consciously heavy-handed and corny. The show was also clearly intended for a family audience, hence the mostly light tone and lack of any material that might come across as potentially offensive; this must almost be entirely attributed to Spielberg\u0027s presence, as I cannot imagine Rockne S. O\u0027Bannon pandering to younger audiences.\n\nLooking back at the first season\u0027s 23 episodes, I wouldn\u0027t say they\u0027re awful; in fact, I found most of them just plain and mediocre. The only one that stood out was Episode 4, entitled \"Games,\" which managed to deliver sharp suspense for most of its duration, still unfortunately marred by a cheesy climax, which became a staple of the series. Of all the shows I mentioned above, this rests with Earth 2 as the worst of the bunch (TNG still the best, of course).\n\nIs Seaquest a bad series? For the most part, yes, but I\u0027ve got too much of a sci-fi slant to hate it. Anyone completely weaned on today\u0027s sci-fi shows (Battlestar Galactica, Farscape, Firefly, Stargate, Enterprise) aren\u0027t going to find much in Seaquest that would appeal to them. But those who grew up on early 90s sci-fi...well, you\u0027ve undoubtedly seen this show enough times already to know if it\u0027s up your alley or not." }
