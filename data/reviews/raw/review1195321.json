Canada\u0027s very own \u0027soap\u0027set in the most beautiful city in Beautiful B.C. What an opportunity for Victoria Tourism. I had the privilege of attending the Premier of the two episodes. I was very impressed.The second episode left me wanting more. What is going to happen - I want to know.Please let there be further episodes. The writing is impressive as is the acting. \u0027Victoria\u0027 is absolutely great.(I am not related to her - I didn\u0027t even know her.)I was also pleased to see a \u0027Senior\u0027 involved. Hey, a love interest for \u0027Adele\u0027 is an idea - doesn\u0027t even have to be with another \u0027senior\u0027! Adele is game for anything I think. My one and only criticism is the character Natasha. I couldn\u0027t make out who she was or what she was supposed to be doing. The fault of the actor? the writer? Me? This is a good show. I want it to \u0027fly\u0027. Karen and co. are to be commended." }
