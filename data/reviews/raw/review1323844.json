Lange\u0027s command of the role makes you feel like there\u0027s a knife in your stomach. It\u0027s that intense. As for the question of what\u0027s accurate and what\u0027s not, that\u0027s not really important. The point is that Lange gets into this role to the max. \"Frances\" isn\u0027t the sort of movie that you can just watch; you have to feel like it\u0027s happening to you, or you might not get the full experience. All in all, a great movie. Also starring Sam Shepard and Jeffrey DeMunn.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
