Who else has done that?", "reviewBody": "Okay, this is going to be long, but please bear with me. Now, I\u0027m not going to spoil this movie for anybody who might not have seen it, but I\u0027ll just give you a little NON-SPOILING teaser-like thing. Just to give you context. IT\u0027S HORRIBLE!!! This is how the movie was made: The director grabbed every bad movie that was ever made by human being, all of the worst dialogue and shoved it into a shotgun. Then the director pulled the trigger and then picked up the pieces and placed them all nicely on a table and then grabbed a bazooka and blew up what was left of the movies/screenplays. But somehow a few pieces managed to stay intact. So he sent the writer to pick up all the pieces of the movie and tried to make a script out of it (TRIED) and failed miserably. He thought he was making a script, but nothing seemed right. But he didn\u0027t care. He just handed that to the actors and they TRIED to read it, but it was so confusing and stuff that they thought it was a combination of Peruvian/Russian/Japanese and Elvish (from Lord of the Rings) Obviously, one language is hard enough to learn and one of these languages shouldn\u0027t even be known by the average Joe and plain Jane. But the actors didn\u0027t care. They TRIED to read but got nothing and then lost the scripts an eighth of the way through shooting.\n\nThen the actors go to the director for... well... DIRECTION!!! (an amazing unheard concept. I mean, whoever heard of a director giving directions? Hmm) Well, he finally decided to help. But this guy is a big fat guy and he forgot what movie he was making. So trying to make himself sound like he still knew what he was doing, he just kept saying stuff like, \"okay and then... this person shows up... and then... you die... No the zombie won\u0027t kill you. It\u0027s part of the drama. Just lie there and pretend to die. yeah, good. Perfect.\" but in the end, he realized that this wasn\u0027t helping and... well, actually, he did something really smart. As in, seriously, this was pretty cool. No other director could have pulled it off. (ie: Spielberg, Lucas, Jackson) The director went to get a lobotomy.\n\nThen he came back and WITH A PSYCHIC TRANSLATOR. Interesting enough, this psychic translator believed that he could read the minds of vegetables. (Which doesn\u0027t make sense because the part of their mind that allows thought is gone) But he couldn\u0027t really. So the actors turned to them for help and asked the translator what the director was thinking. But he couldn\u0027t understand anything. (Amazing) He was reading his OWN mind, but he still didn\u0027t get it. He thought he was hearing a combination of German/Russian and a form of Slavic. And the best part is, this psychic translator is a fat little Egyptian kid with a twinky in his mouth. And he telling the actors what he thinks the director is saying but he doesn\u0027t speak English. But the actors (smart as they are) think that they know what he\u0027s saying a begin improvising the whole damn movie.\n\nThat\u0027s pretty much what you\u0027ve got. My advise to you, see it if you must. You will not like it, and if you do, tell me why. I haven\u0027t the slightest idea how you can like this movie. You can enjoy it maybe, but not like it.\n\n(By the way, I have nothing against Egyptians. I think they are a highly underrated people. I am not trying to insult anyone who is Egyptian or a vegetable. Even if you were involved with House of the Dead.) So all in all, bad movie, save your time, not worth it unless you want to make fun of it. -10/10. (yeah, it\u0027s that good.)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
