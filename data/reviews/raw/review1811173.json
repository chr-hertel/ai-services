Why? Didn\u0027t this Golden Age universe get destroyed in the comics during the \u002780s?\n\nIn attempt to adapt a comic mini-series, Warner Bros is 0 for 2 in my book. The Superman:Doomsday film was just has horrifically boring as this, but The New Frontier lacked any solid plot. Its like, the multiple stories that I expected would mend in the end never happened.\n\nOh my, we\u0027re being attacked by alien monster that wants to wipe out humanity. There\u0027s a shock! Been there, done that, can we just continue from the JLU series and leave the experimental stories for the comics? Keep the DCAU going the way it\u0027s expected by many.\n\nThe animation was pretty cool and I liked the attempt to reinvent that Golden Age art style. The voices were excellent, especially Flash and Batman (Jeremy Sisto sounded a tad like Adam West). I do appreciate the effort, but after the way Warner ended the JLU series, nothing they do can renew my faith in their animated works.\n\nThis was simply boring from start to finish!\n\nI want my 75 minutes back... huh... can you give me that?!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
