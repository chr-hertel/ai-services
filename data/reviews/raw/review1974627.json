Maybe I should make a doctor\u0027s appointment", "reviewBody": "OK, I work at a movie theater and the main thing we\u0027ve been waiting for is High School Musical 3: Senior Year, we knew it was going to be big, so a few co-workers and I got together for the matin√©e before all the kids rushed in, it was still packed surprisingly. But I\u0027ve seen both previous films because my little cousin is just in love with all that pre-teen hoop-la, it\u0027s all good, every generation has something so lovey-dovey-cutesee-wootsee type of thing. But one of the things that made this film enjoyable was to see all the kids who were just participating with this film, I mean, I felt like I was in a concert, the kids were clapping with the songs, screaming for their idols, and just having fun, it was cool to see their reactions, to remember a more innocent time of being in love that much with something. But I felt like this was just a cute movie that is getting too much criticism just because it is High School Musical, give it a break and take it for what it is.\n\nThe gang is back for their senior year and everything is just perfect, they came up with a great idea for a musical to represent all that they\u0027re going through in this exciting year. But there is also a lot of pressure: Zack is facing a tough decision of which college to go to while Gabriella is planning on going to Yale University so far away from him, Sharpay and her brother, Ryan, are competing for a scholarship to Juliard, and Chad and Taylor are learning what to do with the rest of their lives while loosing their best friends to different schools.\n\nGranted High School Musical is never Oscar material, in fact, it\u0027s downright like having a soda after school with the hot quarterback or sexy cheerleader, but like I said, it\u0027s for the kids. Seeing their reactions to this reminded me and my co-workers of a more innocent time, when I had the same excitement to see Spice World when I was 12 years old. We all had these silly things we loved at a young age and for some reason we become more cynical as we get older criticizing everything that the new generation has, so I\u0027m cutting this movie some slack. It had fun songs, cute characters, silly situations, but great dance numbers and is just over all a nice film for the family. I do recommend it just for the fun of being with the fans and just having a good time, no matter how cheesy it is.\n\n6/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
