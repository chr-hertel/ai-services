Tim Robbins played the meticulous character like no one could have. The story has a catch (the escape) but it\u0027s not about the escape. It\u0027s about hope. Morgan Freeman is a tremendous supporting actor, although I believe his role was no less important.\n\nThe movie\u0027s first part is confusing until you get to the middle of the movie. During the entire first half you sit wondering what\u0027s the point of all this. Yet you are glued because you hope there is something. By the time movie enters second part you feel \u0027man i should have been in that prison\u0027 There is no villain in the movie, everyone\u0027s just a character. It\u0027s no good boys winning over bad boys. But yet at the end of the movie you feel triumphant. \n\nMany people don\u0027t know about this movie because of the nature of the story. But then those who know, know too well. No wonder this movie is top rated at IMDb, that is a good enough compliment to the director, script and the actors. Oscar isn\u0027t the end of the world.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
