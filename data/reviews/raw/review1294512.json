The guys who\u0027s brainchild star wreck is advertised the movie in radio and TV claiming it to be the most seen finnish film in the year 2005 based on the amount of downloads from their home site (of course you can add p2p on that number as well).\n\nFirst and foremost, i find it astonishing that a group of nobodies can pull off a project like this. I salute them, even though i\u0027m aware they have worked on star wreck for quite a while...they\u0027re still not professionals.\n\nWhen you look at the starship effects, it\u0027s difficult to believe the above to be true. These ships can compete with the ones seen on the TV-series any day. Naturally time has passed, and the effects can be created without the kind of money needed back in the day, but it\u0027s still amazing this whole thing was pulled of virtually without money.\n\nThe sets and uniforms look good, too. The Star Trek ships look very good on the inside as well, the Babylon 5 ship a bit more stale, but in the same sentence i must admit i did not watch Babylon 5 when it was on TV, so it\u0027s possible that\u0027s the way it should look like.\n\nAfter all the praise we must unfortunately move on to the things that did NOT work for the benefit of this movie. The acting, let\u0027s face it, is amateurish. That\u0027s not the real problem, however. The problem is the way the crew decided to deliver the comedy. Comedy is a difficult form of acting, even the masters of the craft know it. At times the acting in Star Wreck goes just silly, and beyond. It may be less obvious to non-finns who are watching this with subtitles, only understanding the witty writing (which i thought was great, by the way), and missing what the actors are actually saying and how. At points i chuckled, but at times i felt a bit ashamed, to tell you the truth. A good example of the diversity is how the same actor first annoys the hell out of you with the character Sergei Fukov, and then delivers almost like a pro as Festerbester. Overall i felt these actors could\u0027ve pulled off a bit more serious version of this movie, or a poker-face spoof in the spirit of Leslie Nielsen and Charlie Sheen. As it is, the silly faces and shouting, and near slapstick just doesn\u0027t work.\n\nFinally, i see many of you IMDb browsers did not give this film a fair rating. I\u0027ve decided to treat this movie as i would any other, despite the many redeeming factors. After all, it\u0027s the end result i\u0027m reviewing here.\n\nrating: 5/10 - shows promise" }
