Subtle exploration of masks and desire, confrontation between two strange worlds, anatomy of love and silence like its nimbus, cruel poetry and form of past exorcism.\n\nIt is tale of failure. Image of a plague and an oriental answer to the sense of existence.\n\nThe art of Jeremy Irons is fascinating for the profound science to discover every detail of his character. The music is skin of ineffable miracle and form of charming trawl.\n\nDefinition of crime and punishment, pledge for the ambiguity of images and deep temptations, cruel lesson about the lost of certitudes and construction of death\u0027s essence.\n\nA French diplomat in Communist China. An Opera show and the fall in belt of another reality, out of time and social status, out of responsibility and limits.\n\nThe final part is only a splendid question: Who was the object of desire? The singer? His world? Atmosphere? The lies? The illusions? The lost happiness? Or the necessity of disaster after a golden hour." }
