Along with Bridges career!", "reviewBody": "Okay, a preppy teen movie about a low life teen who screws around and winds up at a gymnastic training camp. Where she was two years prior where she made it to the Nationals and bailed from cold feet. While there she meets a lousy, terrible coach (Bridges, being a terrible actor) who seems to know nothing but discipline. \"Stick it\" is more along the lines of a piece of garbage, the acting is bad. Most of the training involves junk skateboard punk/alternative music and honestly who wants to see a movie about gymnastics? Especially one an hour and 43 minutes long! The director obviously has no training other than well going to a gymnastic school where maybe he should have went to a directing school instead. Some of the flipping around is interesting, if put on mute to nod out the annoying music, but aside from that this is a bad teen movie. This coming from the mouth of the age group this was intended for. I have a great place they can STICK this, right in the trash! - *1/2", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
