I would love to make that determination for myself. I have always been a big fan of March, and the rest of the cast all seem ideal choices for their roles. I don\u0027t believe it is in TCM\u0027s library. I think it deserves a DVD release, as does the 1966 (German?) version of \"The Crucible.\"\n\nI check on the DVD availability of this version of \"Salesman\" every now and then, as well as the 1949 version of \"The Great Gatsby\" with Alan Ladd, along with some other films that are (surprisingly) not on DVD, such as \"Last Year At Marienbad\" and \"Sundays and Cybele.\" Good things come to those who wait.\n\nIndeed, even if you have to wait seven years. The Fredric March version of \"Salesman\" made its way to YouTube in October, 2014. The print is not very good, but the movie is fine. March is wonderful, even if he does start out the movie at something of a fevered pitch rather than working up to it, as another reviewer says. The two sons, Biff and Happy, are such ne\u0027er do wells and so dishonest that they are thoroughly unsympathetic. Kevin McCarthy and Cameron Mitchell play them to perfection. Mildred Dunnock\u0027s Linda may be the best performance in the movie. She mediates, observes, cajoles, admonishes, plays on sympathies, comforts and encourages. It\u0027s amazing how many dimensions there really are to this character, and Dunnock finds and plays them all beautifully. \"Death of a Salesman\" is so stagebound that it\u0027s hard to find ways to open it up for the screen, so why bother? The story and performers draw audiences in to \"Salesman,\" and because the subject matter is so unremittingly bleak and despairing, the acting has to be of a very high caliber to sustain interest. This is a feat the 1951 movie version pulls off handsomely.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
