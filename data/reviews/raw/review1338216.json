I still remember the first time I heard about this film because it seemed so silly to me. Elvis Presley (Played by non-other than Bruce Campbell) in a rest home with a Black JFK fighting for his soul against a soul sucking mummy. It sounded like another flaky Hollywood movie. After seeing it I am glad that I had the movie described to me that way. It made the sad subtle undertones present in the movie that much more powerful. This is truly a movie to see I would recommend it to anyone who has an even narrowly open mind. It is also a very funny movie, but not in the stupid Hollywood \"look at that dumb ass I am clearly much smater than him\" way. It exhibited a level of humor that takes more time an thoughfullness. A real humor about things that effect all of us. Also a lot of people say that this movie focuses on the problem of the neglected elderly, which is I think a to narrow view of the point of the film. What the movie does well is capture the sad state of feeling worthless, left with nothing to contribute. I think that this feeling can infect anyone regardless of age.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
