There was a round of applause at the end of the preview, and a fair amount of laughter all though it. I didn\u0027t see the trailer, so I can\u0027t comment on it, but the movie was very well done.\n\nWill Smith did a great job, and there was a good mix of characters in the movie. The direction was excellent, with very few weird moments. This could be a great date movie - good for loosening up the situation. Guys and girls laughed during the movie.\n\nI\u0027m a 46-year-old married male and I love explosions...but if you need explosions in your movies, don\u0027t go to this movie. On the other hand, if you live to laugh Â– give it a try" }
