It\u0027s what the publicity folks mean when they talk about epic westerns. \n\nJohn Wayne is a driven man, he\u0027s got to get that gigantic herd of cattle to market in Missouri or face ruin. He\u0027s not going to be selling them in Texas at carpetbagger prices so he\u0027s putting together the biggest, longest cattle drive on record to get to the railroad terminus in Missouri. He does it with the able assistance of his stepson Montgomery Clift newly returned from the Civil War.\n\nA prologue to the main film shows what happened to Wayne years before. He left a wagon train going to California with good friend Walter Brennan and later that train is massacred with Wayne\u0027s fianc√© Coleen Gray along with it. On the way to Texas, Wayne and Brennan pick up Mickey Kuhn who is playing a younger version of Monty Clift. They settle in Texas and Wayne puts together the biggest cattle ranch in the state which is where the main film starts.\n\nWayne and Clift play beautifully off against each other. Father and surrogate son, first working together and then having a big difference of opinion on the cattle drive. Clift started a film career in Red River playing sensitive people who you can only trod on just so long before they take action. You can see the inner workings of such later Clift roles as Robert E. Lee Prewitt and Noah Ackerman. Monty made a grand screen debut. And it was his debut, Red River was filmed first, but held up in release and Clift\u0027s The Search was released first to the public.\n\nJohn Wayne had one of the best faces for movie closeups ever. In his best performances, top directors like John Ford, Howard Hawks, and Bill Wellman realized this. He has a few in this film and they tell the audience more about what\u0027s going on inside this man than ten pages of dialog. \n\nWith Joanne Dru, Howard Hawks tries to repeat the magic he had with Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not. Joanne is no Bacall, but she\u0027s good and had a pretty good career on her own. Her scenes with both Wayne and Clift have some of the same bite that Bacall\u0027s do with Bogey.\n\nDimitri Tiomkin\u0027s score deserves star billing right up there with the human cast. It is one of the great movie scores of all time period. let alone in the western genre. For me I\u0027ve always noticed the similarity with the cattle drive beginning with the great use of Tiomkin\u0027s music and what Cecil B. DeMille did in the sound version of Ten Commandments as Charlton Heston tells the Hebrew children, he\u0027s takin\u0027 \u0027em to Canaan with Elmer Bernstein\u0027s score in the background as DeMille\u0027s cast of thousands moves out. I\u0027ve often wondered whether DeMille copied Hawks, or Hawks was influenced by DeMille\u0027s silent Ten Commandments.\n\nRed River is a must, for John Wayne fans, for Monty Clift fans, for fans of both and of great movie music like I am.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
