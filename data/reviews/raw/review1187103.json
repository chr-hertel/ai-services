Ben Stiller always does the same character -the Jewish young man, awkward and jinxed-, with a beauty to court (this time is Jennifer Aniston).\n\nEverything here is predictable, nothing surprises us. The film wants to be politically incorrect as well, but many lines and situations are really vulgar. A bad film you can easily forget.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
