Seen it in a theater....", "reviewBody": "I must say, I had the opportunity to see this movie play in a rather large theater in my town, and I was pleasantly surprised at how funny the movie is! The film had a great feel to it and it played to the crowd really well. I cant recall a time the whole theater wasn\u0027t laughing, hysterically mind you! Very funny film, would love to see it touched up a bit and played nationally ! I think the film has great potential at the box office! The characters were very well portrayed by everyone. I really liked stencke , but all of the guys were really funny. The comedic timing was excellent and the lines were delivered really well.... All in all, a good, war hearted comedy!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
