Portraying a bunch of high school students using the Ramones\u0027 music as inspiration to rise up against their despotic principal (Mary Woronov, of \"Eating Raoul\" fame), the whole movie is a mile a minute. It\u0027s basically a big excuse to have fun, and I\u0027m sure that you will. Bullied freshmen? Check. A dorky music teacher (Paul Bartel, also from \"Eating Raoul\"*)? Check. Exploding mice? Checkmate.\n\nAnyway, this is the sort of stuff that makes life worth living. Even for someone like me who doesn\u0027t know the Ramones\u0027 music, it\u0027s pure pleasure. With Roger Corman executive producing and Joe Dante co-directing, how could we expect anything less? Too bad that director Allan Arkush later degenerated into fare such as \"Caddyshack II\".\n\nAlso starring P.J. Soles, Vincent Van Patten, Clint Howard, Dey Young, Dick Miller (who has appeared in every one of Joe Dante\u0027s movies, and many of Roger Corman\u0027s), Don Steele, and of course the Ramones. A real treat.\n\n*It seems like Bartel and Woronov always co-starred. They also co-starred in Joe Dante\u0027s \"Hollywood Boulevard\" and the slasher flick \"Chopping Mall\" (also starring Dick Miller)...in which they reprised their roles from \"Eating Raoul\".", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
