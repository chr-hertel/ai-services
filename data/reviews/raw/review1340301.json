Curious as to whether it was the same film I\u0027d caught on TV about a decade before, I gave up a Saturday morning\u0027s worth of sleep - precious to a college student! - and SEPTA\u0027d to the nearest movie house named in the advertisement.\n\nMy suspicions proved correct. Rather badly dubbed and obviously edited in a fairly clunky fashion, with cruddy sound and picture, it was nevertheless the same interesting flick with a novel science fantasy premise and good pacing. Surprisingly, it had pretty good \"sense of hazard\" elements (including the river petering out in a carboniferous-era swamp too shallow to float the Central Park rental boat through) to keep the audience\u0027s attention.\n\nGiven my grandkids\u0027 present fixation upon all things dinosaurian (they\u0027ve worn out every *Land Before Time* VHS tape we\u0027d bought for them, and my youngest grandson - five years old - is presently pestering us to buy them anew in DVD), I\u0027ve got two questions about this old Czech film.\n\n(1) Why the heck hasn\u0027t a somewhat cleaned-up version been released for home viewing? There\u0027s obviously a market for it, antique stop-motion animation notwithstanding.\n\n(2) Why has there been no apparent interest in the entertainment industry regarding a modern-day remake of the film? Given current advances in CGI - and the lower costs of more mature special effects technologies - it could be done for a much lower budget than something like *Jurassic Park* (1993; approximately $62,000,000).\n\nConsidering the staying power of the *Land Before Time* franchise (one released theatrically and nine more direct-to-video, if memory serves), both the original Czech movie and a well-devised remake could find sales as \"safe\" viewing fodder for pre-teens like my grandkids.\n\nThe video sales would be just as much an evergreen, too, as I\u0027ve found to my continuing sorrow as I\u0027ve had to buy a copy of each *Land Before Time* movie for each of my kids\u0027 families as the grandchildren grow into an interest in Littlefoot \u0026 Co.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
