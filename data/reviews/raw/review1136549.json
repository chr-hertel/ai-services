The film shows the side of nature, emotion, brutality, and humanity that most have never seen before. The towns and villages are filthy, hazardous places, while the forests are clean, fresh and beautiful. Everything is a treat to the eye. The dialog is great. The story is original. I enjoyed it very much, and it remains one of my all-time favorites. Though if it is being shown to children they may be turned off by the violence and maturity of some scenes, but mostly, from the first scene, it\u0027s got you hooked! Pick up the DVD, simply because it\u0027s better than the VHS. duh", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
