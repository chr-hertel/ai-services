See \"GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) to watch how it needs to be done.", "reviewBody": "\"One Perfect Day\" is a musically-oriented drama surrounding the tale of a classical composer who discovers his sister died after taking some drugs in a party. He then decides to pursue the rave scene, and finds himself completely immersing in a new and digital age of music.\n\n...Sounds tight, huh? I thought so myself. This movie does manage to pull some nifty tricks on the unsolicited viewer - but c\u0027mon!! * Crickets do NOT sound anything like a choir when you sample them and pitch them down!! The choir thing is the intro for Orbital\u0027s track under the same name as the movie title.\n\n* Some of the dramatic/hallucinogenic elements are just poorly acted and filmed. The raves are shot in a most rough manner that does not capture the energies of a real party (unlike it\u0027s fellow mates \"Groove\" and \"GMT\").\n\nIf you really want to see a Dramatic movie that\u0027s also related to and includes a lot of action from the electronica scene, try \"GMT\" which is a tight movie about an electronic band and their break-ups and hold-ups.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
