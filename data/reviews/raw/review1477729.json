An interesting premise, and lots of hard work and certainly lots of pyro-dollars spent.\n\nHOWEVER...\n\n1: For a techno-cyberthriller, the \u0027techno\u0027 was very much lacking-- cool robotic arm that does bionic moves with a hard-wired gantry-crane hoist controller. You\u0027d need to be wired into that thing like Spiderman II to do any of that-- \n\n2: With all due respect, we\u0027ve seen much unbelievably baroque fighting choreography-- careful not to put great actors to use making Sunday matin√©e martial-arts sequences.\n\n3: How does it come to pass that a stack of ship containers has a tunnel thru it, dierectly leading to a series of ship-containers that have open ends, and line up perfectly with the mysterious sewer-pipe all perfect for a motorcycle to zoom thru-- not even McGuyver coulda worked that set out.\n\n4: Let\u0027s spend less on the predictable action-sequences and play more upon these great actors, and whatever story can be salvaged. Save the techno-dollars for explaining this amazing machine, thus sparing us the crunching of set-cars we\u0027ve all seen so many times.\n\n5: The great stars of this film were: Uma\u0027s eyes. She knows to use these huge expressive organs with devastating effect. Those who cast UMA, or manage her, lease try to find projects worthy of her talents, and her dangerous eyes... \u003c(0)\u003e \u003c(0)\u003e" }
