Thats all I can really say to this show. When i first heard about it i thought it was just going to be another Dawson\u0027s Creek. But how i was wrong. The colorful characters are absolutely original. Seth the lovable geek. His humor is hidden but once you find its really hilarious. Marrisa the poor damsel in distress. Mischa Barton plays this character to perfection.Ryan is the poor outcast in Orange County. But with that rugged look and strong heart, he\u0027s a match for anybody. Summer is just plain sizzling. The hot girl attitude is portrayed to perfection but she does have a good heart. Its a brilliantly planned show and my Thursday nights just aren\u0027t the same without it. Brilliant Just Brilliant!!!!!!!!!!!" }
