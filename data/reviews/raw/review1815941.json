If nothing else, this film proves that Haines could play it \"straight\" and not always fall back on his \"silly billy\" character.\n\nHaines plays a radio writer married to (but separated from) a sullen and greedy woman (Karen Morley) while he romances a co-worker (Madge Evans). Morley will not give up her meal ticket and bleeds Haines of everything he\u0027s got. But after he loses his job, Morley goes berserk and is accidentally killed.\n\nIn a subplot, Evans\u0027 roommate (Anita Page) who works at the radio station, takes in her kid sister (Joan Marsh) who goes wild in the big city and gets involved with older men (Jean Hersholt, Neil Hamilton).\n\nIn a neat twist, the radio, which is at first seen as a mindless form of entertainment, spoofed via the hokey shows Haines writes, turns deadly as a ruthless newspaper man (John Miljan) uses the radio to persecute and hunt down Haines after the death of his wife.\n\nIt seems like two films combined into one in a minor MGM film, but there are some interesting themes here. The ending is quite surprising.\n\nAs always, Haines is terrific. Evans and Page are solid here as is Morley as the nasty wife. Co-stars include Wallace Ford, Hattie McDaniel, Ethel Griffies, Herman Bing, Louise Carter, and Charley Grapewin.\n\nThe title comes from the catchphrase of early radio star Tony Wons." }
