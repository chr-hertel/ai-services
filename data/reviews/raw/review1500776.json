And what is sad is you people you sit in front of your TV all day and criticize others work when in fact your self couldn\u0027t make anything better than a mickey mouse cartoon which would probably fail anyway. Because if you were entertained then it completed its mission. And Two the reason is shows the wives and the kids and every one involved is because the soldiers aren\u0027t the only ones that endure stress and certain types of Danger. Whos to say the wives and kids out there don\u0027t ever sit up in the middle of the night and wonder if there husband or Dad is going to come home... think about that for a second... because unless you have been through it and had family members in it... you cant say it wasn\u0027t that realistic... and if you want to talk about that one guy couldn\u0027t take on a couple hijackers...and yes it is highly improbably but so was the 300 on Spartans that defeated army after army during the Roman\u0027s days...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
