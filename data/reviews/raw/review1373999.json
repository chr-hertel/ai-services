But a strange fog comes to town and spoils things. Contained within this fog are the ghostly, seaweed infested corpses of sailors who have come to get revenge concerning events exactly 100 years ago. They kill several people, including some fishermen on a trawler out at sea, a meteorologist and child minder Mrs Kobritz. Other strange things also happen, including a piece of drift wood found by KAB Radio operator\u0027s son Andy Wayne. His mum, Stevie broadcasts KAB from a remote lighthouse. She also nearly becomes one of the victims.\n\nThe fog is very creepy throughout, especially the situation of the KAB lighthouse and John Carpenter\u0027s eerie music.\n\nThe excellent cast includes mum and daughter scream queens Janet Leigh (Psycho) and Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween). Also, Adrienne Barbeau as Stevie, John Houseman and Hal Halbrook. With Lee Curtis\u0027s Halloween co-stars Nancy Loomis and Charles Cyphers.\n\nFor a good scare one evening, watch The Fog. Excellent.\n\nRating: 4 stars out of 5.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
