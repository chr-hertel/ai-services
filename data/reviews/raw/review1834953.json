Sadly I had to view this in a poor quality, P\u0026S, English dubbed bootleg so hopefully someone will release a legit, good copy. The film was simply decent but it\u0027s hard to judge without seeing it in its true form. Jack Taylor co-stars and steals the show but Naschy is okay in his duel human parts. His turn as the mummy isn\u0027t a total success but it\u0027s an interesting performance. The American dub has the mummy constantly moaning, sounding like he\u0027s in a porno so this gave off some unintentional laughs. The violence level is quite high with several throat slashings and head crushings." }
