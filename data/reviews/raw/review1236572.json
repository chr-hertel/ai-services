My life practically revolves around this movie. Me and my best friend call each other stubby and squirrelly. we even got shirts made. we made a stubby-squirrelly website. and we wont go by our real names, its been stubby and squirrelly for the past few years. we do tribals anytime something good happens. we do all the hand shakes and other weird things they do. and we can quote the whole movie...come on people, have a sense of humor!! this movie rocks! OK so the movie doesn\u0027t have a lot of meaning, but why does it have to? cant we just watch it cause its hilarious?? I mean don\u0027t you all wish you could have as much fun as bud and doyle? Me and Stubby do! WE ARE THE EVERLASTING FORCE OF...STUBBY!!! Squirrelly!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
