The movie recounts their adventures searching for one.\n\nIt may sound like a movie ideal for little kids--but it really isn\u0027t. It\u0027s an excellent adaptation of Richard Adams book which was written more for teenagers and adults. It\u0027s an ecological tale of how men are destroying the earth and (inadvertently it seems) killing innocent wildlife. It\u0027s also a very interesting story about how a group of rabbits survive on their own.\n\nThe animation is excellent--right up there with Walt Disney. The score is great, the script intelligent and the voices used perfectly match the characters. However, as I said, this isn\u0027t really for little kids. The story is dead serious and the only humor is provided by the bird Kehaar (who I personally found very annoying although Zero Mostel DOES have fun with the voice). Also, at the end, it gets very violent and quite bloody. When I saw it in a theatre in 1978 one small kid was in tears by the conclusion. So, use your own judgment but I would never let a small kid see this. This is perfect for teenagers and adults.
