Before I saw this movie, I had read numerous reviews on it. Some said that it was bad. Some said said that it was good. I had to make my own assumption. After seeing it, I can honestly say I loved X-Men The Last Stand. Yes the story was kinda simple and the characters weren\u0027t as fleshed out as in the other two X-Men movies, but it was great nonetheless. It did have some other downsides to it. The main one I think was that it didn\u0027t follow the comic book closely. But don\u0027t be nitpicking the entire movie otherwise you\u0027re not going to have a fun time. Just go there and watch the movie. It also left way for maybe a sequel or two (I\u0027m not going to spoil anything. Just watch after the credits). It was a fitting end to this X-men trilogy.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
