If you accept this movie for what it is - a combination of fly on wall technique and a personal narrative - a drive through the deserts of the U.S. will never be the same. After seeing this movie I sincerely hope we find a solution to the immigration problem between my country and the U.S. Until that happens, more people will die and this movie will be a peek into what it\u0027s like to risk everything to find a job. Hopefully, enough people see this movie so they\u0027ll think twice about the current methods of migration for Mexican workers in the U.S.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
