Dan\u0027s company has just been bought by another company and a lot of people are losing their jobs. One day Dan, meets his cocky new boss named Carter Duryea, who is a young man who happens to be half of Dan\u0027s age. As the film goes by we see how Dan is having a rough time with his job, Ann being pregnant and sending Alex to university. We also see another likable side of Carter, where he is insecure and deep down he is lonely. Dan, and Carter start to become friends and soon Carter meets Alex, and they start dating behind Dan\u0027s back. Problems occur in the company and in the lives of both characters and this film shows how they deal with these problems and how they go on with their lives and the film does this with emotion and comedy. Winner of The NBR Award for Best Breakthrough Performance By An Actor (Topher Grace, who plays Carter Duryea) at The National Board Of Review. In Good Company, has good direction, a good script, great performances by Topher Grace and Dennis Quaid (who plays Dan Foreman) as well as a great supporting cast, good original music, good cinematography and good set decoration. The film is unpredictable and realistic which is one thing I liked about it a lot. You never quite know where the plot is going to go or what the characters are going to do. And, I also liked the characters in this movie because they were believable and likable and you could relate to them. The film is also smart, charming, has good character development, amusing, engaging and overall a nice feel good movie that is entertaining and funny but realistic as well. I don\u0027t really watch That 70\u0027s Show. Which actor Topher Grace started out his career but I hope that gets more film roles because he was very good in this film." }
