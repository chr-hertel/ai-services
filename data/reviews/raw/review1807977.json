While many people flock to buy Van Damme or Seagal\u0027s latest pics, less chase after Mr. Lundgren\u0027s work, and that\u0027s a shame. He has something going on. Something good.\n\nMM (Missionary Man) is his third directorial effort, and although it isn\u0027t as good as his last picture, it\u0027s still interesting and shows some of the class and skillful touches he displayed in The Mechanik and The Defender.\n\nThis film is basically Pale Rider with Dolph in the Clint role. Can he handle such a role? You betcha. He plays a mysterious man named Ryder, who rolls into a quiet small town to attend a friend\u0027s funeral. Before you can say \"trouble\" he\u0027s already figured out that a rich young jackass is running the place and is behind the friend\u0027s death.\n\nThe rest of the first and second act is taken up with the plight of the Indians who live in the town. We\u0027re shown how modern America struggles with the Indians\u0027 beliefs and their way of life. Credit must be given to Dolph for trying to make more than a low budget shoot \u0027em up.\n\nUnfortunately, as a result of that part of the story, the middle act drags a little. However, a rousing final act, where a gang of bikers turn up to foolishly stop Dolph, kick-starts the picture back to life.\n\nThe high noon showdown is BLOODY. Not Rambo bloody, but bloody nonetheless. One poor soul even takes a 12 gage to the face! It\u0027s these scenes that show Dolph has an understanding of action greater than his rivals. If Stallone\u0027s enjoying a cinematic action rebirth, Dolph\u0027s enjoying a DTV rebirth.\n\nThe look of the film is also noticeable. Lundgren has bathed the film is a dark sepia look and the music is subtle and underused.\n\nThe supporting players are a slight letdown. Some seem like community theater actors, while others, especially the Native Americans, come off as genuine and real. John Enos III rocks up as the lead heavy, Jarfe, about thirty minutes from the end, and that\u0027s a shame. His character should have been in the whole picture.\n\nIncidentally, Dolph does the best he can with the very modest production values he has. Note to Sony: Give these stars more money to play with. Granted, they don\u0027t need $100 million, but are a few back more out of the question??? (Dolph, if you\u0027re reading this, put Enos in another one of your movies. He was cool.) And onto the man himself. As I said in my review for The Mechanik, Dolph has grown into his skin. He\u0027s comfortable and relaxed. He\u0027s the same in MM and I\u0027m sure if he keeps getting good material to make, he will continue to relax and look good. It seems the days of the awful Storm Catcher and The Minion are behind us.\n\nHopefully, Dolph will continue to put out quality efforts like this. I can only imagine what would he would do with a bigger budget and better actors. It\u0027s okay though, because for now, we\u0027ve got The Defender, The Mechanik and Missionary Man to enjoy.\n\nGood work, Mr. Lundgren.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
