You may not have watched it - and in that case this plot reading shall be new to you. It is a very good film with good songs, good actors, but is a wee bit disturbing.\n\nThere, now you can decide whether you would like to watch it or not. This is particularly recommended for people who like musicals, don\u0027t mind scary films too much and do not know exactly what happens. If you have happened to read the book and not have watched this you may want to watch it. \n\nThis film starts with a song, showing many hungry children in a workhouse, who have had just about nothing but gruel in all their life. One boy called Oliver Twist is chosen to ask for more, as they have hardly any every day and because he asks he is punished and sold. He just wishes for his mother and sings, wondering when he will he will have someone to love. He escapes and begins a long journey to London...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
