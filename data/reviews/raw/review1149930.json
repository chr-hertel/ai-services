The plot concerns a bunch of hillbillies, the Kwimpers - a dad, his son, and three orphans, who take over some beach property under the Homestead act after they run out of gas there. Elvis portrays a dummy of sorts - he plays it very naturally and he\u0027s quite funny! It\u0027s not so much that he\u0027s dumb, but he\u0027s so guileless, literal, and helpful, he seems that way. With these attributes, he continually gets the best of the bad guys, including a mobster, Simon Oakland, Joanna Moore, from child welfare, and assorted others. The conceit makes for some hilarious scenes. In one, the mobster, after Elvis beats up his thugs, decides to blow up Elvis\u0027 family home. They prepare a bomb and put it in a box. When Elvis sees it, he thinks the mobsters have forgotten their package and dutifully returns it. BAM.\n\nOne poster mentioned that Elvis doesn\u0027t try to look as if he\u0027s singing. Apparently, he was notorious for not bothering much with lipsynching, though I\u0027m not sure why. For my money, the only really good song in this film is the title one. And lipsynching or not, Presley looks great.\n\nI guess we can spend time lamenting the fact that Elvis didn\u0027t make better films or get the acting opportunities he deserved, or we can enjoy what we have. And Follow That Dream is better than most.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
