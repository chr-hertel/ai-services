It seems that the demise of \"Street Hawk\" is cloaked in mystery. Why was it canceled? Could it be that such a television series caused a few too many young viewers to \"TRY THIS at home\" on their own motorcycles, get themselves hurt, or worse, and the producers incurred many law suits as a result? It seems obvious this CAN and DOES occur with wrestling, as well as controversy over the series, \"Jackass\". Might such similar, controversial tragedy surrounding a popular show of the seventies result in a show being canceled? I remember when these self-same European racing bikes were first made available to the buying U.S. public. There was an effort to bar their sale in this country, though obviously to no avail. In inexperienced hands, they can be quite dangerous, to the rider, as well as the general public. So, did legalities such as this play a part in cancellation? I highly value your opinions." }
