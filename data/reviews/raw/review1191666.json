Anyway, about a month or so ago I saw the trailer for the film and it completely turned me off. I went on my usual movie site IMDb.com and stated that the trailer looked like crap. This is when the director Rob McKittrick told me to watch the film before I commented on it, so I wrote the director back telling him that I promised not to say anything else about the film until I saw it. So today, Tuesday October 11, 2005 I went to my local multiplex and watched \"Waiting\" \n\n\"Waiting\" is about the workers at a restaurant called Shenanigan\u0027s. The film shows life in a restaurant along with the friendships made and the pranks that go on behind the scenes. The restaurants ringleader is Monty (Ryan Reynolds) who is a cocky, sarcastic, a**hole who is assigned the duty of training the newbie Mitch (John Francis Daley). As Mitch\u0027s training goes on he learns all the pranks that go on at Shenanigan\u0027s including the rules to the notorious game which is played at this restaurant. Laughs are suppose to ensueÂ… \n\nWalking into the theater earlier today, I felt hopeful that the movie will at least make me laugh. About 30 minutes into the movie, I didn\u0027t laugh once and just started looking around the empty theater. As the movie continued on for its 93 minutes running time, I still didn\u0027t laugh, not even once. I understand comedy is subjective and I totally understand that but even in comedies I don\u0027t normally enjoy, I still get a chuckle or two out of the film. This movie did not make me laugh or chuckle once; I just sat there as the title suggests \"waiting\" to laugh. This film\u0027s jokes are all done before and are for immature people to laugh at. I mean for anyone who is actually mature will not like the jokes in the film. Even the whole putting things in your food joke was used before in films like \"Road Trip.\" The so called jokes in this film are not funny and there isn\u0027t a fresh joke in the sight during the entire films running time.\n\nI really don\u0027t understand how Ryan Reynolds still gets work. I mean I know it has to be because of his looks because he tends to play the same character over and over again in every movie, you know the cocky, sarcastic, womanizing goof-ball. And every time I see Mr. Reynolds on screen, I feel bad for not liking him but honestly he\u0027s not the least bit amusing to me. I have never seen such an actor play a one-dimensional character all the time. His character in this film is not likable; it\u0027s just overly cocky and annoying. Justin Long really disappoints me in this film and he is extremely wasted as a character that is confused about what he is going to do with his life. Dane Cook who I heard is suppose to be one funny guy is underused and pretty much wasted as well in this film. Anna Faris plays her normal Anna Faris role but actually seems to have a little more intelligence here. Luis Guzman is also a real waste as the main cook who seems to have obsessions with both showing his penis and getting sex from his girlfriend. His character gets very annoying very quickly.\n\nThis movie runs on two gags, the so called game that the male workers play and the whole lets drop people\u0027s food on the floor or do disgusting things to there food gag and honestly neither work. You feel as though the script is very poorly written and almost wonder how the hell someone read this thing and approved it for a feature film. The script contained enough f-bombs to compete with the film \"Scarface\" and the movie loved to use the word cock and penis like the movie was intended for a bunch of 10-13 year olds who giggle whenever someone says one of those words. The movie is rather pointless with no real plot and is extremely poorly written with one-dimensional characters.\n\nBottom line, this is without a doubt the worst film of the year. I didn\u0027t laugh once in this film, I didn\u0027t like any of the characters, there was no point, and lastly there were no redeeming qualities at all. This movie was made for immature people who think that fart jokes and crude sex gags are still funny. The movie contains recycled jokes and one-dimensional characters. And while the director Rob McKittrick seems like a pretty down to earth guy, I really don\u0027t understand how he got this film made. And his biggest gag of all though is that he actually tricked me into seeing this flick and giving him my $6.00 and an hour and a half of my time. But in the end, the negative reviews for this film are not a lie and the film deserves every one of them. I totally agree with the Variety reviewer Dennis Harvey who states in his review \"The wait for laughs lasts the entire length of Waiting\" because this truly is a very unfunny and unoriginal film.\n\nMovieManMenzel\u0027s final rating for this sad excuse of a movie is a 1/10. Check to see what other movies are playing and if nothing else is playing, well go home and stare at the wall, it\u0027s just as amusing.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
