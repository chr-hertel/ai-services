When I read the novels, I was amazed at the details about the characters \u0026 the details about law Gardner has carefully crafted into his formula for every one. As I read them, I realized that the folks responsible for this series must have read them too. Raymond Burr when he was this age fits Erle\u0027s physical description of Mason perfectly. Sometimes the novels had Mason doing more physical work than the TV show but that might be more due to the time constraints of television. I am so happy to see the DVD\u0027s of the first season finally coming out. It is long overdue to get this series out (\u0026 even more so another series from the 1960\u0027s in this genre E. G. Marshall\u0027s THE DEFENDERS - oh I wish this one would come out too!). \n\nAll the characters in the novel are so well cast \u0026 portrayed by the cast in this old series- it is incredible. Lt. Tragg, Hamilton Burger, Paul Drake, Della Street - all fit Erle Gardner\u0027s novel depictions so well. These first seasons as they come out are mostly Erle Gardner\u0027s material (somwhere about 75 to 90% of them) \u0026 that especially adds to the enjoyment. It\u0027s wasn\u0027t until the 3rd or 4th season that they had to get away from the master author\u0027s material. Mason as drawn by Gardner \u0026 portrayed by Burr is the ultimate American Hero. He can do it all whether it calls for physical work \u0026 especially the brain work. Burr\u0027s demeanor in these court trials is always fantastic. Get out \u0026 get the DVD\u0027s which I understand have the episodes restored to the original length as many were cut short during airings over the years to fit in more commercials. This is a bonus as sometimes vital clues \u0026 facts in episodes were cut in order to promote the channels budget running them. Then get ready for our all American legal hero- Perry Mason - to get another confession from the guilty person at the trial. Watch too for some of the suspects as you will see some folks on the stand getting grilled by Mason who later went on to become famous in other roles. Seeing them quake \u0026 quiver on the stand is great entertainment. Television couldn\u0027t get any better than this in the court room.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
