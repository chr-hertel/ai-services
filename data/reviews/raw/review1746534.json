Pennebaker does something different with this clearly- and probably slightly revolutionary- approach to form of cinema verite approach that has as much to do with directorial choice as it does with lack of any budget, and trying to use the best of an all-access-pass to the behind the scenes with an iconoclast like Bob Dylan. As far as I can tell, and maybe it\u0027s something sort of naive, there doesn\u0027t seem to be an inherent bias on part of the filmmaker. A director of a documentary usually, and most often effectively, will have some kind of subjectivity, or something to say with the collection of interviews and the subject matter. But we never really see Pennebaker skewering either side or the other. For whatever one might perceive to see in Bob Dylan from this time capsule, a man at 23 who was swarmed by media buzz and an acclaim that was staggering (and, from the start for Dylan, more than a bit of a crock), it can\u0027t be said that Pennebaker is being unfair to anyone here, not to Donovan or the press or whoever it was that broke that glass in the street.\n\nAnd least of all to Dylan himself; it\u0027s because of a stripped-down, bare-boned approach to film-making with a camera in a room getting down the beats- only once does Pennebaker go to a \u0027flashback\u0027 of sorts- that one can\u0027t truly and easily pin down what Dylan\u0027s all about. And because of the questions raised about the nature of a young artist in a frenzied environment where the pressure to be one thing, i.e. \u0027folk hero\u0027, \u0027voice of a generation\u0027, et all, it\u0027s really not simply one of the best rock documentaries, but one of the more insightful, strangely involving documentaries of the past 50 years. We see the fun moments; Dylan having laughs with his fellow musicians or playing guitar with Joan Baez or others; the quiet moments like writing a song on the typewriter; we see the interviewers perplexed at the thought that they\u0027re getting prodded by a subject who can disarm their queries at nearly every turn either, arguably, by a stand-offish quality, or just not knowing how to logically answer a question without sounding untruthful. And then the music, on stage, sort of alone in a way with the audience tuned into every word he says as though he\u0027s a golden calf.\n\nMany scenes are simply fun, experimental. The opening to the film is like a punk rock music video, as Dylan just stands there, awkward and blank-faced, turning over the cards for Subterranean Homesick Blues, with Ginsberg at the end walking across the alley Dylan was standing on. Seeing Dylan with an acute sense of humor is refreshing, and at times it\u0027s almost like he uses it as a defense mechanism, as a means of uncertainty to go through fans and the like (the scene with the science student has been described by some as Dylan being simply bullying, but again there seems to not really be any bias- Pennebaker could make this guy look like the fool, but each side is heard, and whoever comes out the wiser once the conversation ends is anyone\u0027s call). \n\nIt might go without saying, however, that some of the material in the film could use some context: Dylan had to go under the same sort of press attention and questions every time, over and over, which was something that Dylan could never really adjust to like other celebrities or popular musicians. Hence a scene like the heated talk with the TIME news reporter; if one knows nothing of Dylan, it might make him seem hostile, or at least uncomfortable. But even with this one sees the nature of an interview where there isn\u0027t balance- TIME hasn\u0027t listened to much of Dylan\u0027s music, and Dylan already has a bias against the magazine for, according to him, not printing the truth as it could. \"Do you care about what you do?\" the interviewer asks him, to which Dylan takes umbrage. It\u0027s almost like watching a loop, where neither side will give in exactly, and it\u0027s too complex to tell which side is really wrong or right. Questions between them lead to the audience bringing up questions: is this \u0027folk hero\u0027 really a jerk? Is there some truth to his ranting? What about the generation gap? It\u0027s a perplexing scene that is, in its tense manner, spectacular.\n\nBut as many will want to see in Don\u0027t Look Back is the music, the mood of the man who\u0027s life was work. It\u0027s interesting to see Dylan, in context, on the precipice of his transition from folk to rock, starting a slight disconnect with the folk scene with a few fellow band-mates on the tour, and yet always at his peak playing the same songs he\u0027d played repeatedly for the past few years (Times They Are A\u0027Changin is the same opening number on every date of the tour). There are many pure moments of spontaneous music (Joan Baez singing Turn Turn Turn, and Dylan with It\u0027s Alright Ma, I\u0027m only Bleeding ), and practically all the stage stuff, including Hard Rain\u0027s Gonna Fall and Blowin in the Wind, two of the most atypical of his songs. At the same time one sees and hears someone like Bob Dylan at the peak of his powers in the 60s, there\u0027s the observant dissection of fame- even through Pennebaker\u0027s technical imperfections of a loud camera- and if only a small taste of the \u0027why\u0027 that Dylan couldn\u0027t ever really be himself, and if so wedged somewhere in a quasi-persona. Don\u0027t Look Back is amazing.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
