The funny thing about this is that Hitchcock, with his usual wit and charm, asks the actress some rather personal and embarrassing questions, which you can tell has the actress nervous. At one point Hitchcock asks her if she\u0027s been a bad woman and she replied no but then Hitch follows with \"But you\u0027ve slept with men\". Ondra then turns away from the camera from the embarrassment. I\u0027m sure the two were just having fun and it really comes off this way. It was great seeing this historic clip just to see and hear a young Hitchcock having fun with his blonde lead, which would be something that he\u0027d do until his final days. As I\u0027m sure everyone knows, Hitchcock\u0027s Blackmail began as a silent feature but half way through they decided to switch it to sound so this test was very important to see how well the actress could handle it." }
