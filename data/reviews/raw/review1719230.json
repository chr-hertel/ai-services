Truly fantastic.", "reviewBody": "A perfect sister film to one of my absolute favorites, Spirit of the Beehive. It also stars Ana Torrent and has similar themes. And I like it probably as much. Torrent, three years older but looking pretty much the same, plays the middle child of three girls. At the beginning of the film, their father has just died. Their mother (played by Geraldine Chaplin) died a while back. The film is told through the mind of Ana, who is still mourning her mother, and she often sees her. It can be confusing at the beginning. Chaplin also appears as the adult Ana, who narrates some of her thoughts, or possibly as what Ana believes she will become. This is very ambiguous. The girls\u0027 aunt Paulina is now taking care of them. The duty was kind of forced upon her and, while she\u0027s trying her hardest, it\u0027s taking its toll. She\u0027s stern and not well liked by the girls, especially Ana. There isn\u0027t much plot, per se, and what little there is shouldn\u0027t be ruined. We often see Ana\u0027s imagination and memories come to life. We see her witness fights between her parents. Later on, she reenacts them with her sisters. The film is about what children observe, how they interpret it and how they act on those interpretations. The film also has political ramifications, subtle ones that are pretty difficult to grasp. The title is the beginning of a Spanish proverb that goes: \"Raise ravens, and they\u0027ll tear out your eyes.\" Like Spirit of the Beehive, the film depicts a child experimenting with her own cruelty and violence. Supposedly this is all a criticism of the Fascist government (Franco had just died by this point, so his regime was just on its way out). It\u0027s a very dense and fascinating movie. You\u0027d probably still be swimming through its mysteries on a hundredth viewing. If you thought possibly that Ana Torrent was not acting in Spirit of the Beehive, this will set you straight. Her blank, soulful expression is here in full force, of course, but here you see the slightest smile creep across her face, and you can just tell exactly what she\u0027s thinking. I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ve done an awful job reviewing Cr√≠a Cuervos. I haven\u0027t expressed how touching it is when dealing with Ana\u0027s loneliness (there\u0027s a scene where she dreams that her mother pops into her bedroom to tell her a story that\u0027s just heartbreaking), or how it often straddles dark comedy, like the scenes between Ana and the maid. I think that difficulty in reviewing it shows just how layered and confounding the film is. It shoots right up my favorites list. It\u0027s easily the best film I\u0027ve seen all year. Bravo to Criterion for bringing this one to DVD. Hope they also get to Saura\u0027s La Caza sometime in the future.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
