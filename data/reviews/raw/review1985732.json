I was 9. I found it to be a great little heart warmer for back then. Just because someone had a tooth ache doesn\u0027t make him a critique. Dondi is what really happened during the second world war It happens during all wars but Dondi captured all of them and they showed it too. I hate my family coming to my house I moved way in the woods. I am a recluse. I took a wagon wheel rim and modified it making a sign on my front yard drive way. It stands straight up on its end and it is stuck in concrete The words on my welcome sign to my front yard reads. Welcome Ira and Irma Deelybuddy. Our names are Ann and Joe. I bet my sister kid graduated high school by now She was eight the last time I saw her. Get the point Dondi was a great movie it had something for everybody but the tooth ache guy", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
