What will be your reaction? I propose a simple test. If you loved Ang Lee\u0027s \"The Ice Storm,\" you\u0027ll probably love La Ci√©naga as well. And if you found it unbearable (as I did), you\u0027ll probably find this unbearable as well.\n\nI can\u0027t say it sucks; after all, the critics adore it. I can say that after the promising opening, the film seemed to me to be less a depiction of morass and more a morass itself, swallowing the viewer into an unmanageable plethora of characters ranging from the unlikeable to the despicable.\n\nHowever, there is one character who does become fairly sympathetic. And when you identify that one, you can pretty much guess how the film ends. Stupid me, though. I subjected myself to these toxins to the end.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
