In the follow-up to the 1st \u0027National Treasure\" where Nicholas Cage and the gang try to uncover hidden secrets in U.S. landmarks looking for a treasure hidden from the British soldiers during the civil war --- a twist is thrown in right from the beginning where the Gates family of treasure-hunters names could be darkened forever by a rumor that an ancestor was part in the assassination of Lincoln. This put Cage and company back on the trail of the treasure to prove that it\u0027s real and there is no truth to the rumor. Of course, there is an antagonist other treasure hunter, played by Ed Harris, portraying an ancestor of John Wilkes Boothe who wants his rumor kept in place to free up his family\u0027s evil past. This begins the ever increasingly complicated series of clues leading eventually to a literal goldmine(hint, hint). Of course, Mr. Gates has the same companions as the first movie with added ones, like his Mom, played by the Queen portrayer, Helen Mirren, who can read ancient lost Indian symbols and is sought after once an artifact is found leading to more answers. The bottom line is this movie is overblown, idiotic, non-sensical Hollywood-fare but has a sense of humor and a pace that gets increasingly harder to turn from and makes it a watchable and entertaining movie. One of the highest forms of escapist entertainment because of it\u0027s absurdity but if that\u0027s what you\u0027re looking for it\u0027s perfect. There are also some wonderful sets and puzzles that have to be solved as the movie goes on that reveals a very well-thought out and executed thriller to enchant and entertain the masses. Which this definitely does despite it\u0027s silliness.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
