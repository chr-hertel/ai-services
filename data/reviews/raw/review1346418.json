Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant deliver one of the most prolific cinematic performances as Bergman was very much convincing as adorable young American agent and Grant was also exceptional. This movie is honored to be enlisted in criterion collection and is really a treat to watch for all but especially for Hitchcock fans!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
