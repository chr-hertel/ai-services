I thought the casting of Ma and Pa couldn\u0027t be more perfect, Yvonne DeCarlo and Rod Steiger, do memorable performances as done the supporting cast. It begins like Friday the 13th and Halloween with young adults like Lynn, Cynthia, Jeff, and the other three who fly to the Pacific Northwest Islands. Cynthia feels guilty for the accidental death of her baby which we know from the beginning. They encounter the oddest family ever who live without electricity or modern conveniences. The children are stranger than the parents. Fanny played beautifully by Jane Wright. Michael Pollard plays brother Woody and there is another brother Teddy. Fanny is the strangest one who dresses like Shirley Temple and pretends she\u0027s twelve years old. The family seems stuck in the 1920s and are religious zealots. It\u0027s not a bad horror film, in fact it\u0027s better than most but I felt like there something missing at the end. I won\u0027t say anymore but it\u0027s good film for Halloween.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
