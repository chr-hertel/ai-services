This movie is inspirational in that it tugs at you to be something better, to step outside of yourself and your comfort zone, without the warm fuzzy outcomes.\n\nI went to see this movie with no preconceptions; I haven\u0027t read the book and only knew that Emile Hirsch was in it. I was really just astonished at the magnitude of the whole thing. This movie takes on a story and locations that needed to be huge and totally embraces it. Every scene is shot beautifully, with some really breathtaking moments. The acting is great, Hirsch is completely believable, Hal Holbrook is heartbreakingly wonderful, and of course Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt are always great. The relationship between Hirsch and Catherine Keener plays perfectly. I was surprised at how long the film went on (2 and 1/2 hours) but couldn\u0027t think of anything that didn\u0027t need to be there.\n\nThe thing that I found so great about this movie was its relevance. Though I doubt many people are so eager to go put themselves in such dangerous wilderness, the sentiment hits close to home. In an age of devout commercialism I think most people can understand the urge to try to find something pure in the world. This movie makes you want to go out and look for it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
