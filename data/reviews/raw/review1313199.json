Great ensemble acting from a large multinational cast in three languages, amazing production values, humor, pathos, tragedy. Like a fine foreign film, only this one was actually made in Brooklyn! Rumor has it the film cost far less than the reported \"less than one million dollars.\" To paraphrase the New York Post review, if only those pea brains in Hollywood could see this movie, they might learn a thing or two. I\u0027ve seen the movie several times, and it gets better and more nuanced with each viewing. I only hope that others get to see it. Hopefully Ari Taub will continue making quality movies which truthfully and entertainingly tell stories without the excess and bloat we\u0027ve become numbed by.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
