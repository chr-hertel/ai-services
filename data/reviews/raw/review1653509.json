I remember watching it on opening night and seeing the audience confused about when to leave. Fanboys with staffs and fake beards got up a good twenty minutes before the final roll and then quickly sat down realizing that \"hey, it ain\u0027t done.\" Well, it should have been. I think that if you win an award for something, it needs to be great at whichever aspect throughout. The movie won for editing... but it wasn\u0027t edited well throughout. The direction wasn\u0027t anything to hoist high either. I didn\u0027t find the acting dynamic in any way... and if I see one more helicopter sweep of the mountains as our heroes run, oh never mind. Oh, and the giant arachnid was nice, but some of the other special effects, ugh.\n\nNonetheless, the series was impressive because the time it was turned around in. But I don\u0027t think they needed to sacrifice quality for getting \u0027em out three Christmas\u0027 in a row. Some of the special effects in the final lava sequence looked like \"Land of the Lost\" for Chrissakes.\n\nSo for those of you who want to argue that they deserved awards because of the daunting task of turning around such films, forget it. They could have taken their time like Harry Potter and done fine. I don\u0027t even like Harry Potter, but I don\u0027t see flaws. I don\u0027t see repetition. The acting is more impressive. So why award them when they didn\u0027t even live up to their best potential? I look forward to the fan boys saying my comments weren\u0027t helpful. That\u0027s why I gave it one star. If fan boys are going to bully the vote to put these movies in the upper echelon of films (which is ridiculous); I reserve the right to underscore them to help future generations know that the fans are delusional and overzealous.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
