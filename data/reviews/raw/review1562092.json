The setup is these girls saw him do a show and asked him to come see them after, in their hotel room.\n\nThe video starts with Diamond speaking into the camera as he holds it giving the audience, which is supposed to be his buddies assumably, what might happen next at this party. He enters the room and almost immediately starts to look and comment about the sex toys. Which of course gets the action started as the girls are supposed to be drunk. Fellatio, girl/girl and intercourse with Diamond included ensue. Puntuated at the end by a Dirty Sanchez on one of the girls. Throughout Diamond is making inane and ridiculous commentary along the lines of \"woohoo\" \"unleash the beast\" etc, etc.. Apparently, if this is his real personality, he is as boring as his SbtB character Screech, from which the video title is derived.\n\nIt\u0027s fairly clear, fairly early in the video, that this is staged and considering Diamonds career took a nose dive after the kiddie sitcom and has never made it off the mat, who could blame him for trying to get something, anything, going. Unfortunately, the girls he manages to get for this video, almost certain strippers but just as certainly B or even C grade strippers, can\u0027t keep this interesting. If you mute out Diamonds pathetic color commentary I suppose it\u0027s watchable, if nothing more than seeing a D list celebrity in a sex video. The novelty of it wears off almost immediately however if you have the volume up.\n\nSo watch it if you have a friend that got it free or something but certainly do not pay money to see this feeble attempt at maintaining some celebrity for a never was like Dustin Diamond.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
