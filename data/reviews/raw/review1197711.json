After seeing the movie, I can understand why people love this show. The adventures of these two radio guys from NY is quite funny! Crude and silly humor for fans and non-fans alike. Fans of the show will love seeing the antics of the people they wake up with every morning--but you don\u0027t have to know much about the show to enjoy the craziness on screen. For your gringo amigos, it is subtitled. Leave the kids at home and laugh, laugh, laugh!!! Strip club and horse scene are a riot!! Loads of sex and innuendo and funnier than many so-called comedies that come out of Hollywood.If you\u0027re a prude it\u0027s probably too crude for you...so stay home and watch reruns of The Waltons. I bet John-Boy never \"helped\" a horse!! More Carolina in the sequel please.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
