The story starts from when a Thai child is being brought up to show respect to, and protect the family\u0027s pet elephants. In Thailand a very long time ago, elephants were said to the animal that gave the great kings their power. So, they had their finest worriers protect them from being hurt in any way. When the child grows up and his elephants end up being taken from him, he vows to get them back by any means necessary.\n\nThis film has some of the best Martial Arts scenes I\u0027ve ever seen, and all with no cords, stunt doubles, or CGI!! If you just want to see some people get plowed by a fairly small man, watch this movie! Apparently size doesn\u0027t matter after all", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
