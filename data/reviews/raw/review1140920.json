It is weird, though, to find an independent movie, the brainchild of a single person, that is as unambitious and clich√©-ridden as a committee-brewed Hollywood potboiler.\n\nThe portrait of rural people is intended to be affectionate, I think, but these characters don\u0027t ring true to me--I have had quite a few meals in small-town diners, but never overheard a debate on the merits of different nineteenth-century English novelists. One might suggest that writer/director Semans has no more experience with rural culture than the Coen brothers, and considerably less satiric verve.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
