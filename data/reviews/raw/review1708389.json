Rent the video instead.", "reviewBody": "Originally, I wasn\u0027t sure if I wanted to see this movie, but people just kept talking about how great it was. Let me tell you, it wasn\u0027t that great. It will appeal to a certain demographic (children, some teens, and baby boomer adults who like corny movies). And it was almost decent until the middle where it just seemed to drag on.\n\nThere were just so many bad things about the movie that I don\u0027t know where to begin. John Travolta as a woman was ... horrible. His accent, his acting, his make-up, and everything was a big FLOP. The dancing was the worst. Michelle Pfeiffer and Christopher Walken, can\u0027t dance to save their lives and should never try it on screen again. It was painful to watch.\n\nAmanda Bynes just smiled the entire movie and Nikki Blonsky wasn\u0027t nearly as interesting as Ricki Lake (who was the original Tracy in the 1988 film). Pairing her with Zac Efron was a mistake, especially since he looked confused and in his own world throughout most of the movie.I could go on and on about how the directors just found a bunch of big-named actors (well, sort of) of all ages and pieced them together in this long, drawn out movie, but I won\u0027t.\n\nI\u0027ll try to say something positive about the movie ... half of the songs were decent, but after a while they started to drive me crazy. The costumes were nice ... except for Blonsky\u0027s. (All they did was give her a white button -down shirt for nearly every outfit and sneakers that didn\u0027t work well). The sets and staging were nice and ...\n\nI really can\u0027t find anything else to say about this movie that\u0027s positive. Just be prepared for an overly extended movie that fails to measure up against other REAL musicals.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
