It\u0027s better than the lack luster matrix 1 and, the almost as good, matrix 3. This movie holds great action around a wonderfully scripted scenes. This movie sets out to pull the rug from under your feet making you have a different look on its predecessor. Then add the story from Enter the matrix and the Animatrix shorts creates \"the\" movie experience.\n\nDeeforleeds rating \n\n5/5 stars - worth every star! Please see this with an open mind or you\u0027ll just be disappointed" }
