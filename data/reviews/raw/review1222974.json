One was terrible acting, as if the kids were extremely aware of the camera, and horrible, fake dialogues, which sounded like they were written by an old person that was a teenager decades ago and desperately tries to mimic the contemporary teenagers\u0027 way of talking. It made me cringe every 5 seconds. Another problem I had with \"Elephant\" was how painfully it relied on the stereotypes. Of course the boys were shown playing video games and listening to Hitler\u0027s speeches. On the other hand, one of them was shown playing piano, I guess to show the contrast and ambiguity. It didn\u0027t work out though; the psychological portrayal of the two boys (not mentioning other kids in the film) was shallow and very predictable. I was really hoping to get some insight from this film. All I got was the combination of all possible stereotypes about the shootings; bad acting and horrible dialogues made the experience even worse.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
