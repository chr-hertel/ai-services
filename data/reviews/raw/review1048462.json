I have not always been a Bonnie Hunt fan but found her performance surprising and rich. All the performers were wonderful. It\u0027s a film about adoption and the grief that can come with missing someone you have never known. I had never thought about this topic before but found myself to be surprisingly touched. Also it\u0027s wonderful to see a film deal with complicated emotional issues with subtlety and grace. It looks beautiful, too: wonderful cinematography. I hope it comes to the theater because I\u0027ve been telling my friends about it and want them all to see it!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
