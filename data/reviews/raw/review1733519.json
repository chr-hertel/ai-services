Is there really anything else to say about this film? Neve Campbell is completely unconvincing as an object of anyone\u0027s desire. She\u0027s not talented, nor is she attractive (why hasn\u0027t her agent told her to get that overbite fixed???). The sex scenes are crap, the music is distracting, the dialogue is irritating. It seems almost as though there was a longer, better, more interesting film here, but all of the good parts were mysteriously clipped out, leaving behind this disjointed, amateur, faux-artsy heap of rubbish. The pacing in this film is completely off. Why do we need to see 45 minutes of her in that unflattering dress, walking around the city having awkward conversations with random people? Skip this film. Or, if you\u0027re really hard up, just skip to the sex scenes. Wait, no, don\u0027t, they\u0027re awful. Yes, even the lesbian scene. It\u0027s really not worth suffering through the rest of this garbage.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
