I pictured myself as Sara being in love with the Goblin King.. I loved the dance scene when everyone is dresses in elaborate costumes..I love the characters too, especially Hogle who reminded me of my uncle (looked like him too!) i am now watching it with my eight year old grandson who put it on the video for a nice afternoon surprise! This movie has everything---a cool rock star (the wig and clothing were great), romance, adventure, magic and fantasy that are timeless and every child should see. It is a must have!!!" }
