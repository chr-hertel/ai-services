When the two boys grow older, the Father of the young French boy takes his young son away from his life long friend. The young Frenchman finds himself on a desert island (or so he thinks),where he acts the part of a blind wandering beggar. Along the way,he befriends a rather crass Englishman (also a beggar),and manages to re-connect with his past (I won\u0027t spoil the rest of the plot for you). This is yet,another fine example of 3D CGI animation,done to perfection. Michel Ocelot writes \u0026 directs this charming little fairy tale,which also teaches young children about just how evil racism really is \u0026 how we should,as a people,live as one. Tagged a PG rating by the MPAA,this film does contain a few scary moments that could be a bit frightening to very young children,as well as some unpleasant moments of racism", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
