Adaptation of Judith Guest\u0027s novel is heavy with overripe dialogue that portends to have the ring of truth. Redford seems determined not to let this scenario turn into a dirge, and so adds glimmers of humor, but occasionally he gets too colorful (as when Timothy Hutton, who wins a date with Elizabeth McGovern, smiles and sings \"Hallelujah!\"--that\u0027s cute, but then he continues singing it until the joke loses its freshness). As the parents, Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore are less interesting than the younger players in the cast; Moore, working a convincingly immobile persona, has some of the weakest scenes, and her society maven doesn\u0027t end up making emotional or logical sense (particularly at the finish). Judd Hirsch plays one of the those touchy-feely movie psychiatrists who always wake up in the middle of the night for a crisis, though the majority of Hutton\u0027s scenes are bracing and natural, and perky McGovern has a sweetness that isn\u0027t forced. Handsome film is well-paced, yet it has confusing and/or anticlimactic passages, and the final scenes don\u0027t work. Hutton was also awarded an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and the film won as Best Picture. *** from ****", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
