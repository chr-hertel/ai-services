I saw nothing in this movie that would have any value. I didn\u0027t find some deep meaning that made being bored worthwhile, it wasn\u0027t nice to look at (it looked really horrible, actually), it wasn\u0027t exciting... Maybe some people could find something in there. But I found nothing that justified me wasting my time and money. I thought House of the Dead was the worst movie I\u0027d ever seen, but at least that had some of my attention with the violence and nudity. The best of that they\u0027ve got in here is some red paint smeared around and an out-of-shape naked guy. I\u0027m not saying I was watching for that. I can forgive either a bad but entertaining movie, or a good but slow movie. Not both of the bad sides in one. I was interested in the angels but they look like plastic statues and they squirt milk when you stab them. I only kept watching because I thought SOMETHING must happen but it was just a predictable ending. I didn\u0027t feel anything at the end because the main character said and did the most stupid things. I understand the whole faith thing but it doesn\u0027t seem like it was done well. I\u0027m just an average viewer, and this movie was boring and meaningless to me.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
