The subject is familiar, players are usual, there is nothing make the movie watch worthy except the filmmakers ability. American\u0027s know movie business very well. They can make simple stories into successful projects with the help of actors/actress, special effects, actions etc. Of course, this is not come from just ability, mostly it depends on money. And always money makes money. If you invest more, you will probably take it. The end of movie has been made in childish way. Anyway it does not matter, you have a good time while watching it. This is the consequence of entertainment sector. Watch and have fun.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
