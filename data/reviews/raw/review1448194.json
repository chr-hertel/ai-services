In this one an American aid-worker gets run down by a car after her stealing a photography. Wallander and the rest of the Ystad police are on a case with ties to Afghanistan.\n\nApart from Henriksson many of the actors delivery of lines leave much to be desired. Pretty common in a low-budget tvmovie, but a couple of extra takes here and there could have helped. Tom Lyell deserves credit for his brief but welcome visit.\n\nAll in all a below average filming of a book that in my view is not Mankells best. Save it for a rainy day when there\u0027s no Colombo on TV.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
