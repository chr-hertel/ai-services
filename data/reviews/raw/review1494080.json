I have been knowing the producer of this sensational bad movie; since his childhood, so I can tell you why he has been making this movie, and all of his movies. The guy, John VdWoestijne, has never had a woman,never had a girlfriend in his whole life, and he has never xxxxed !! He dreams to fxxx a lady so hard, but only when she is dead; it is so much easier, and she is not refusing or struggling back....\n\nRegretfully in Belgium, some guys like Marc Dutroux execute or experience their dreams in reality...\u0026 get sentenced for life.\n\nVdWoestijne knows better; he lives his fantasies thru\u0027 his actor(s) (Nick van Suyt)in his movie(s). VdWoestijne is Lucker and vice versa.\n\nTherefor this film deserves a 9 on 10 !! The sights of the small town of Kortrijk are fantastic, romantic and scary.....Only thing missing to build the suspense; the police. In the originalscript this was foreseen,but regretfully it was not filmed in the end, and that is why this film gets boring... Luckily there is a great musical score, but the wrong single was picked otherwise it would have hit the USA\n\nBe cautious, in 10 or 20 yrs, after 1 or 2 remakes,this film will be a blockbuster,your present copy handled at Sotheby\u0027s.\n\nI agree the rest of VdWoestijne \"oeuvres\" are too poor,to be considered as good bad movies,if you understand what I mean. But I was not longer involved. Signed; the man with prostitute (might be autobiographic as well)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
