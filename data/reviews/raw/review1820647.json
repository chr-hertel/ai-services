This was a mistake. The historical errors mentioned in other comments here pale in comparison to the casting of a spoiled egotistical twerp as Henry.\n\nThe comparison to earlier Henrys, Charlton Heston, Richard Burton, Robert Shaw, Charles Laughton, Rex Harrison and others almost brings tears to my eyes. Mr Hirst your name will now serve as a warning to future viewers. Congratulations to the rest of the cast for doing so well in the face of Mr. Myers and poor writers. What a waste of talent. Tis a pity that a medium such as Showtime with its artistic freedom approved the showing of one of history\u0027s great rakes as a \"little man\" in all meanings of the term.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
