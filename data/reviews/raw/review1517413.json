There\u0027s nothing subtle here in this film produced by Harold Lloyd and directed by Richard Wallace.\n\nLucille is the scatterbrained daughter in a family of zanies who meets EDMOND O\u0027BRIEN in a mix-up over theater tickets. He\u0027s a casual, laid back executive, not very assertive (unlike his later roles), and when he needs a substitute secretary Lucy shows up for the job. It\u0027s a hectic film from then on.\n\nGEORGE MURPHY is her brash sailor boyfriend, LLOYD CORRIGAN her brother, HENRY TRAVERS her father and the befuddled FRANKLIN PANGBORN is a pet shop owner.\n\nIt\u0027s a more subdued Lucy than usual with the others having most of the heavy mugging and pratfalls to do. MARGUERITE CHAPMAN is wasted as O\u0027Brien\u0027s neglected girlfriend. Nice cast but they all have mediocre material to deal with.\n\nSumming up: Passes the time pleasantly enough, but is nothing special.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
