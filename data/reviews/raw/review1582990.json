It is fiction, but gets its inspiration strongly from Huey P Long, Louisiana governor in the late 1920s and early 1930s. But the movie is actually set in the 1950s. I was born and raised in 1940s and 1950s Louisiana, much of what I experienced in school was influenced by Governor Long. And how many times have I driven over the New Orleans bridge named after him? Maybe being a native has colored my response to the movie, but I found it completely enjoyable. As I also found scenes shot in Audubon Park among the oaks, and the little bridge crossing over to the golf course.\n\nSean Penn carries the movie as Willie Stark, a blue collar man from North Louisiana who is encouraged to run for governor, only as a ruse to split votes. But Willie was smart, and when he realized that, he rallied all the \"hicks\" like him and won by a landslide.\n\nJude Law is newspaper man Jack Burden, fascinated by Willie, and who eventually works for him during his tenure as governor.\n\nAnthony Hopkins has a small, but important, role as Judge Irwin, a family friend of Burden\u0027s, and who supports Willie\u0027s eventual impeachment attempt.\n\nKate Winslet is Burden\u0027s friend from childhood, Anne Stanton. Mark Ruffalo is her brother, Doctor Adam Stanton, and who Willie eventually asks to head the big, new charity hospital he is building. (A side note, my mother\u0027s life was saved in the 1950s in the real Charity Hospital.) Even though the story and characters are fictional, anyone who understands Louisiana and its politics will also understand how realistic they are. It is the age old question, does the good justify the corruption? \n\nSPOILERS. Just as the real governor, Long, was shot and killed at the Capital in 1935, the governor Willie Stark, as he was beginning a campaign for president, was shot by Doctor Stanton. Both died, and the shooting was set up by the Lt Governor, as a way for his getting into the Governor\u0027s mansion." }
