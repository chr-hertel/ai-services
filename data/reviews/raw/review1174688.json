The plot has to do with sharks from a government research facility escaping from captivity and going on the rampage. The acting isn\u0027t bad for the most part and the script is good. The problem is that the director insists on playing this with a knowing silly attitude, so if the dwarf jokes aren\u0027t bad enough you have these really dumb music cues that take the edge off any tension. This would have been so much better had they played it straight.\n\nGiven the chance of seeing this via rental or the appearance on cable, I\u0027d wait for cable. My guess is this will show up on the SCIFI channel as one of their Saturday night premieres.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
