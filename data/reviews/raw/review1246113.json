The movie tells, in no way previously done, of the simplest teenaged feeling of not fitting in. Edward wants to love and fit in, but he simply cannot because of his abnormality. However bittersweet the ending was, it certainly reminds the audience that love is not something you find often, but it is something you should do anything for. This film is a classic for all fans of Tim Burton, fans of romance, or fans of movies in general. It will have you laughing, crying, and shaking your head while seeing all the similarities you and Edward have: clumsiness, elegance, beauty, abnormality -- all the things that make up life.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
