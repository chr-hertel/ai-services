This is part of the films flaw in that the acting seems to have been pulled right off the stage rather than coming from real life. This shouldn\u0027t put you off from seeing this movie since its quite good and is possibly one of the finer adaptations of the story. Sticking closer to the book, or so it seems, it tries to unravel the weird story with Jeykll and Hyde taking up less of the limelight. This is two friends trying to hash out whats going on. Its a refreshing take on the tale and adds nice shading to everything thats going on. Out side of the stage acting that some people use this film really has no flaws other than a bit too much of the chroma-key or blue screen effects that it uses to supplement its backgrounds. There\u0027s nothing wrong with it, but it seems to have been over used sand at times I felt like I was watching a video game rather than a movie.\n\nUltimately this is a film to put on your must see list especially if you want to see a good version of a literary classic.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
