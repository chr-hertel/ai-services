The film seeks to save itself through extensive special effects because its creators did not know what to do with a cast with leads as stellar as Michael J. Fox, Trini Alvarado and cameos as lively as that of R. Lee Ermey. Ermey offers up a ghostly lampoon of his FULL METAL JACKET character Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann that makes the only three minutes of this film worth watching, which is unfortunate since it\u0027s almost two hours long. It\u0027s been long commented that the horror film done badly becomes comedy and vice versa, but rarely that a different kind of vision produces comedic horror, often done brilliantly by directors like Whale, Polanski, Corman, Hitchock, Romero, and Hooper. THE FRIGHTENERS, however, is neither frightening or funny, but it is a loud excursion into the mundane with a hackish script that might work well for Saturday morning cartoons, but is exhausting fare for most people over twelve years of age, or anyone who doesn\u0027t find the nightly news terrifying. I couldn\u0027t believe how wretched this film is." }
