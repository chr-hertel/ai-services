The idealism of youth, middle age sensuality, puppy love - all thrown in to make a decent concoction.\n\nBrad and Beth are a final year couple at Wirth - both are ambitious and pursuing their career ambitions with great vigor. Things start getting interesting when Brad runs into an older woman. Little does he know that the woman he is sleeping with is the notorious Duke - his girlfriend\u0027s thesis adviser.\n\nLots of idealism mixed in. The plot never ceases to surprise. Gotta watch it all the way to the end. \n\nBeth looks cute throughout - pity they don\u0027t show enough skin. Lisa isn\u0027t bad either - for a middle aged professor. The other couple looks great too - in the end - lots of learning - not enough curves. A bit more of sensuality and this movie would be a big time hit.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
