He sees Tom sleeping one day and leaves him a note that says: \"Dear Tom, This country life is getting me down. I\u0027m off for Broadway and the bright lights. Goodbye forever, Jerry.\"\n\nWell, \"forever\" doesn\u0027t turn out to be long as the mouse finds out the glitz and glamor also has a lot of dangers that the quiet country doesn\u0027t have. This turns out to be a good moral lesson about \"the grass being greener....\"\n\nThere is some really nice artwork here. You really get the feel of New York City back in \"the old days.\" Kudos to the animators here.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
