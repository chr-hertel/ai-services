It\u0027s just too long and complicated. I couldn\u0027t focus on any one plot or character. I found Vincent Price, Jane Russell, and the settings enjoyable. I wish I could say they were distracting from a potentially great story - but, there is no cohesive story to match these surroundings.\n\nI don\u0027t think I have seen Mr. Mitchum drop a cigarette down the from of another thug\u0027s pants before - the guy seems to get over it quickly, so I guess it was a mild burn...\n\nMr. Price asks Mr. Mitchum, at one point, \"How come you don\u0027t drink?\" \n\nHuh? \n\n***** His Kind of Woman (8/29/51) John Farrow ~ Robert Mitchum, Jane Russell, Vincent Price, Tim Holt", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
