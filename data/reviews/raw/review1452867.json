This game single handedly made me want to get a PS2. The first time I saw saw the graphics I was stunned. The game play is better than the original, the story, while complex, is on par with the the first Metal Gear Solid. The one complaint MANY have is the main character, Raiden. Yes, he is not as bad ass as Snake, but get over it! That\u0027s one of the very few bad things in this game. The boss fights are more intense, the characters more interesting, and the dialogue is quote worthy. To this day there are games that can\u0027t match MGS2\u0027s graphics, and can\u0027t match anything else as a whole. Is it better than the original? That\u0027s entirely up to you, but they both get 10\u0027s from me.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
