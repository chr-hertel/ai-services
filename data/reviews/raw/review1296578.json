It is totally racist and any movie that depicts the KKK as heroes should not be viewed. Unfortunately, I received a copy of this terrible movie on DVD for Christmas. I did not open the package and threw it in my garbage burner! Hallelujah! I love silent films. Not this drivel piece of garbage! D.W. Griffith\u0027s movies are not welcomed in my home. I will not, and I totally refuse, anything that refers hatred among human beings. A human being is a human being no matter what color, creed or religion they belong to! I lost a friend because of the KKK! Now, why should I give in and see this movie again?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
