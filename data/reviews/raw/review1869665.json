The Effects. The Plot. The Action. The predictable cameo from Stan Lee (look for it).Note to self:cameos are cool and I should be in all of my films.What else can I say about a film that has raked in 200 Million over the last 5 days (according to the radio station that I showered to this morning) and thats darn impressive! I remember getting a text message saying stay till after the credits and I am happy I did and for those who are probably reading this-you know why. Robert Downey Jr.-No relation to Morton Downey Jr. has really delivered as opposed to Mr. Pacino (in 88 Minutes). His Stark is believable-Jeff Bridge\u0027s character is also believable.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
