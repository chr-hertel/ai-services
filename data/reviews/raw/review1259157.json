This is without a doubt the best movie I\u0027ve seen (kicking the Harry Potter movies\u0027s asses by a mile). The acting is, from what I think, terrific. Unlike a lot of fantasy books, LOTR seems more than just a fantasy/adventure story. It\u0027s almost like a mythology. It\u0027s very believable, and Peter Jackson is an excellent director. He made all the actors read the books, that\u0027s some amount of dedication if you\u0027re transferring a much loved classic onto the screen. I\u0027m told by most people that some of the things from the books where taken out in the movies, but it\u0027s still good. But with a book-to-movie you can\u0027t add everything and things have got to be taken out. Unlike some book-to-movie movies *cough*Harry Potter*cough* everything taken out seems sensible and there still is some point to the movies.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
