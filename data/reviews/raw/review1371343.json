It was exaggerated, of course, but still interesting to see and in many respects good to see because of the onslaught of tabloid-mentality journalism that seems to have taken over the media in recent years. That kind of \"reporting\" should be exposed and ridiculed.\n\nWhatever, you can enjoy this film for the acting alone with Dustin Hoffman, John Travolta, Alan Alda, Robert Prosky, Mia Kirschner and Ted Levine. These actors, and some good dialog, make the film move along at a good clip despite the absence of much happening on screen.\n\nThe story gets you involved and reminds me of the famous 70s film, Dog Day Afternoon, in which much of the film takes place in a bank. Here, it\u0027s a museum, and a man is in a predicament something like Al Pacino was in that film except Travolta\u0027s character here is totally innocent.\n\nThe screenwriters added bit of humor to this involving story and that made it even better. It\u0027s very good entertainment and certainly recommended.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
