Feel like i have watched that video on \u0027the ring\u0027 and something bad will happen to me for being sucked into it. \n\nI guess this dismal sitcom is destined to be used for pimping products and will never actually see the light of day. The actors must be rather embarrassed to say the least. bad enough to make the pilot, but to then have it shown 9 years later to a critical audience. \n\nWow - some blow to the ego.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
