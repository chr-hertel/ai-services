I have seen some bad horror films in my time, but this one.... It has pretty much every single horror movie clich√©. The creepy kids (preferably Asian), scary animals, dark spooky basement, \"rebel\" teenage hero, and the parents that won\u0027t believe them. Let us not forget that supposedly shocking plot twist. Which I knew what it was within the first twenty minutes. The acting was, at best, atrocious. Please save the money, do not waste your time on this Amityville formulated excuse for a movie. Spend the hour and a half doing something more entertaining....like smashing a large rock on your foot repeatedly.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
