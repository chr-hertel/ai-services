The acting and cinematography make it seem like it was filmed while it the actual events occurred. Pontecorvo couldn\u0027t have made a better film. Forget Spielberg and Scorsese. Forget Hollywood. This is real cinema.\n\nIt\u0027s a documentary style movie, and it will teach you something. Beyond that, it will make you FEEL something. That\u0027s what movies are supposed to do, right? Pontecorvo knows the answer to that. At the end of this film, you\u0027ll say to yourself \u0027Wow! Now that\u0027s how a movie should be made.\u0027 \n\nColonialism and oppression have a tremendous affect on people. Watching this movie, you will see exactly how.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
