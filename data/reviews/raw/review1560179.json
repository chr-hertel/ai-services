Its okay, I\u0027ll take my nourishment where I can get it, but I won\u0027t be surprised if the same person that served me emotional redemption then serves me useless trash.\n\nWilder knows how to make movies. He knows, I think, how to take something in his mind and put it on screen more or less intact.\n\nThe problem is that he is a pretty stupid man, and what happens to appear in his mind usually isn\u0027t all that interesting. \"Sunset Blvd.\" is on my list of the most important films in existence. Sherlock Holmes, the phenomenon and his impact on the structure of narrative is one of my dearest insights.\n\nPut the two together and you get something worth watching, no? \n\nNo. And it isn\u0027t because the picture was butchered by the studio. Its dreadful all the way from beginning to end in every dimension expect each shot is so perfectly framed you know a master is home, partly.\n\nIts a difficult thing to begin with humor and try to weave something interesting around it. Much easier the other way. Its simply a matter of architecture: you need something substantial at the root. Its clear what the problem is here, that the man simply wanted to amuse. So we have a building balanced on top of meringue.\n\nSexual intrigue, a redhead, drugs, a new dreadful weapon of war, a secret society, serious sibling rivalry, homophobia, and all that before you get to what makes Holmes interesting, the manner of narrative.\n\nPass on this. Wilder was confused.\n\nTed\u0027s Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life." }
