Was it really supposed to be funny? I LOVE a good black comedy, but smiled only once, and even that was forced. Just plain boring . . . and tedious. \n\nOne star for the movie and one each for the wonderful PS Hoffman and the same good performance, once again, from LLinney.\n\nI guess I\u0027m totally out of step with 99% of the people and critics who find no end to the superlatives with which they are gushing about this can\u0027t-forget-it-too-soon movie. Sorry.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
