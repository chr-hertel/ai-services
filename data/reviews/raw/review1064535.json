I came across this show as it\u0027s currently repeated on five every Saturday morning and I continue to love this show. I knew of this show when it screened during the 90\u0027s but couldn\u0027t care less at that time I was a huge fan of Beverly Hills 90210 which I\u0027m not a big fan of anymore now. I just enjoy catching up with the lives of the beautiful and gorgeous people of Melrose Place. My favourite character is Alison (Courtney Thorne Smith) but my least favourite is Amanda Woodard (Heather Locklear) she is quite a B****. The cast are brilliant and I love the situations, which the characters go through every week just as our lives aren\u0027t as dramatic as these characters. Melrose is Glam but much better than Beverly Hills but as the seasons went on the series got over the top that\u0027s when I think it went downhill I think. The best year was the early years. I hope a DVD is released both in the US and the UK, as it was very popular and successful in both sides of the Atlantic. Melrose Place is one of my favourite shows and it\u0027s a classic with plenty to enjoy and a place we all wouldn\u0027t mind living in." }
