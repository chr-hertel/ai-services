Even with the formula of a 2nd-string old time movie like this one might expect some slight subversion, as Kubrick had little moments with Spartacus Leone would with this film. Not quite- there are some small moments of Leone humor strung in there, and a couple of keen visual gags (I did love the bit where the Colossus started to bleed down, as if going to the bathroom). \n\nBut where are the close-ups, one (as in me) would ask? The kind of extreme close-ups shot in a widescreen scope as to turn it really epic, as if the faces were landscapes? Unfortunately Leone and his poor DP Antonio Ballesteros make the images seem too flat in the 2:35:1 scope, and soon the visual scheme becomes something staggering considering the director: dull. And it\u0027s not without trying with production and art designs, which are quite spectacular, but the film never feels like it\u0027s taking off somewhere, and the story even feels a little confusing, like when a botched kidnapping takes place at a guy\u0027s house.\n\nOn the other hand, fans of Rory Calhoun might get a kick out of seeing his chiseled features and hair glopped always (even after a dirty fight) with tons of hair-care product. He\u0027s worth watching, but really the other actors don\u0027t make too much of an impression, aside from the fake beards and the attitudes less than two-dimensional. It doesn\u0027t help as well that the dubbing over the original Italian soundtrack (save for Calhoun) is even more mediocre than that done in the spaghetti westerns. \n\nThe plot is fairly simple, and sometimes doesn\u0027t even make too much sense- unless you\u0027re a fan of Lex Luthor in schemes involving making the colossus more important than Greece- and it\u0027s mostly excuses to show off characters in togas and saying pedantic dialog and acting both pretty and crude (though not very dirty or \u0027off the street\u0027 as in other Leone films). There are pockets of drama, like when two soldiers get tortured with hot wax being poured on their chest and back, and a climax that attempts for the staggering in scope.\n\nBut despite the lofty intentions at producing good genre product, it lacks subversion and thus becomes rote. I know I shouldn\u0027t go too far in length to compare this to his great films (matter of fact, I can\u0027t think of one of Leone\u0027s westerns, or Once Upon a Time in America, being less than excellent), and that it\u0027s his technical debut as director. But what\u0027s most disappointing is seeing what\u0027s not there as opposed to what is.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
