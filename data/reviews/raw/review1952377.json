Philosophy is many times merely used in movies to be intriguing (\"Waking Life\" did this to my great annoyance) and to make the moviegoer think about \"far-off\" and \"crazy\" concepts just to do so. While there is an entertaining aspect to this approach, it lacks depth. \"I Heart Huckabees\" looks into many of the existential concepts of \"Waking Life,\" but puts them in the context of real life- real emotions and real consequences. It\u0027s suggested method of living without human drama may not be practical to be followed completely, but it does show some insight into the insignificance of many situations we are constantly immersed in in our daily lives, and suggests that people lighten up when bad things come our way. This movie just put me in a great mood after watching and also hit that philosophical spot in my stomach." }
