Does anyone know WHY it isn\u0027t available in some form or the other? Is it lost? Does it need restoration? The content, while out of date, nevertheless, isn\u0027t the main issue. It\u0027s that this film needs to be seen. What good are films, such as this one, \"Porgy and Bess,\" \"The Constant Nymph,\" etc tied up in estates for no one to see and pass opinions on? I wish there were a website of \"unavailable films\" where one could reference why certain ones are never heard from. Cable channels too many times show the same films over and over again but never ones that need to be seen." }
