Sure the film doesn\u0027t have a major budget, but I thought in general the acting was very good. Michael Dorman as Rusty and Genevieve Lemon as \"Aunt\" Dianne were particularly good, whilst Emily Barclay was always believable as the thoroughly rotten Katrina.\n\nKatrina is not a character you can empathise with - let alone like, but the movie makes for good car-crash watching. How far will she go to get what she wants? What exactly is the relationship between Kat and Danny? Overall a very dark and comedic movie, with some wicked dialogue. The closing line of the movie was genius, and possibly the best I\u0027ve seen yet!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
