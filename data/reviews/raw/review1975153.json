I will never understand why German TV - journals always write the worst things about this movie (...which is called in Germany \"DANGEROUS KIDS-HIGHSCHOOL OF HOPE\" - isn\u0027t that a stupid name for a film!!). Maybe it is because they don\u0027t like to see Mickey Rourke as a clergyman. This is so stupid: Finally, he is an actor, and a good one, at any rate. It is as stupid as if a journal magazine would condemn a movie because Will Smith has a serious part to play. I believe, those writers never really had a look at that film by themselves. - By the way, I liked the end of the movie, although it is sad, because that\u0027s the way such things happen in real life.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
