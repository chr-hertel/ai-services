The way in which the battles were portrayed on such a low budget would make any film fan proud. The mild problems in French English can be overlooked, and all I see is a wonderful performance by a gifted actress. The artillery fire was a bit drawn out, and some of the special effects teams may want to take a lesson in CG, and I found just two sound effects which were taken off Casablanca, perhaps as an omage. The cannons I can say were somewhat out of era, as the \"le swine, Dvallalle models were not in production for another 15 years, and some of the long shots displayed these inaccuracies. Overall a great film." }
