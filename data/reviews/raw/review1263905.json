We again join Tommy Jarvis who has not adjust to life post-Jason at all he has become more less mute and living in a bizarrely normal halfway house. As the kids start dropping like flies it becomes apparent that Jason might be wrongfully accused this time around, however this is more an underlying story point than the dominating theme as this a fairly standard Friday the 13.\n\nVery run of the mill slasher movie that tries to make changes almost on the fly as little consideration is given to explain these points. I think special mention should be made of the brutality of this film by far the most violent of all the Friday the 13 with some almost takashi Mike style violence in places. Most of the actors earn their B-movie badge for this one special mention to some of the bit parts of the mother and son rednecks and the broken down greasers who provide laughs in their limited roles.\n\nFriday the 13th part 5 a new beginning is a very serious and violent slasher movie that attempts to break the mold but end\u0027s up only half filling the cup.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
