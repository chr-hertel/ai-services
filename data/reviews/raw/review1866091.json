But as the movie went forward I was pleasantly surprised. The great thing about this movie is he\u0027s not making false statements that can easily be disproved (as we have seen with many propaganda filled movies) but just let\u0027s the scientist talk and make there point across. This movie is solely based on interviews and logic. If you go in with an open mind, and really pay attention to the fact that Ben stein is not the one really saying much, he gives an opinion and let\u0027s the scientist do the rest by asking legitimate questions. This movie isn\u0027t so much an anti evolution film or pro Christian, as it is just bringing up such points such as: even if all life is created by a single celled organism, what put that cell there before that or even if aliens made life, is that not still a design creating us, if we came from primordial ooze, how did the ooze get there? If you go in with an open mind and realize that Ben doesn\u0027t really make any statements, he just lets the people speak for themselves, it is then your turn to make up your own mind.
