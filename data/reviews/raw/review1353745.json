My IQ has been lowered just because I watched it.", "reviewBody": "Why on earth did this movie get so popular? It isn\u0027t funny, in fact it is just stupid. My stomach turns every time I see a Vote for Pedro tee-shirt. This movie did what a lot of comedies fail at. By that I mean fool people int laughing at things that aren\u0027t funny. They do this by trying to confuse the person watching. If you don\u0027t understand it after you watch it 10 times, it just isn\u0027t funny. It isn\u0027t smart or artsy like the rest of the voters think, it is just plain stupid. Hopefully people will realize that it isn\u0027t good, and stop saying lines from it, or laughing at its\u0027 ridiculous brand of humor. Nothing about this movie is smart, or well written. Just face it the cast of this movie have successfully duped you. Probably the worst movie I have ever seen.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
