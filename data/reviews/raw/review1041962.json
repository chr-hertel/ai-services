I loved this film, initially, for the score. The music is larger-than-life.\n\nAt best, the story attains mythic proportions, but at the very least it\u0027s a parable concerning abuse and entrapment. Everyone in the story seems trapped one way or another and desperate for escape.\n\nThe film is about many things, but its sensibilities derive from an era that is barely comprehensible to contemporary film-goers. The controversy regarding the quality of the film, in my mind, makes it a kind of benchmark. People who don\u0027t like it, I don\u0027t want to know.\n\nIn dozens of ways this film has re-invented the process of making films. If you haven\u0027t seen the documentary \"Wamego\" that chronicles the production, you must. The making of Firecracker is profoundly and fundamentally revolutionary, revisionist and eminently worthy of study on every level.\n\nThis film is a work of art in all aspects. Of course, it\u0027s not for those looking for action; this film allows you to meet and get to know the characters. The cinematography is incredible and the score is just as good, if not better, than most studio-made epics.\n\nBravo!
