The story is really a bit weak and the ending is a let down. Was looking for something a bit more rip roaring at the end but the movie went out with a wimper.\n\nMortenson puts on a convincing Russian performance and Cassell is really stealing the show with the psycho son impression, better than Andy Garcia\u0027s Godfather 3 version. I think this movie suffered from low budget but I don\u0027t think Cronenberg gets a lot of money to spend. Photography and staging is up to his usual standards but Crash remains his outstanding achievement. Still, entertaining enough but not one of Cronenberg\u0027s best!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
