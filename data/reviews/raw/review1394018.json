It is so moving and extremely well acted but of course what would you expect with 3 such talented stars in it ? The scene where he finds the coin sends shivers down my spine !\n\nIt is a beautiful Love story which should soften even the hardest heart. There are not that many films that i could watch over and over again but this is one of them, i never tire of seeing it.\n\nThe music is so well written/chosen that i only have to hear a few bars of the main theme and a tear appears in my eye ! A definite 10/10 in my book, but then i am a soppy old romantic !", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
