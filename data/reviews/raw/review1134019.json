I usually give a lot of props to David Dhawan, since he is probably the only Indian director who ventures with comedy more often than anyone else. Its usually a nice break from all the dramatic movies. But I have to say this was a total disaster. \n\nThe film is filled with songs... at least 6-7 of them, almost never allowing the movie to ever maintain a flow. The storyline of the movie is pretty decent but a lot more could have been done with it to make the movie a whole lot better. Most of the movie was a drag, specially the second half. \n\nSushmita Sen has done a great job and looks good as always, Salman Khan is getting pretty good at comedy, and Arshad Varsi is hilarious as usual. But barring maybe 25-30 minutes of funny original scenes, the movie is mostly a big waste of time. I would recommend to definitely wait till the DVD is released for watching the film. It might be just a little more enjoyable.\n\nIt is probably not the WORST David Dhawan flick, but a BAD one.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
