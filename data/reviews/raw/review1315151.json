John Carradine as a dashing young puppeteer and artist comes off very nicely. Could anyone miss that incredible voice? Of course, the Bluebeard story has to do with a man, marrying, then killing his brides. While women are murdered, there is really no connection with the original tale. That doesn\u0027t make it a bad movie. The scenes between Carradine and his victims, his lust for murder based on his first experience of murder, really is haunting and terrifying. We are aware of what he is all the way along, and we pull for the young women to be saved, but there is a voyeuristic element. The film really works from beginning to end and it\u0027s because of the lead actor that this happens.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
