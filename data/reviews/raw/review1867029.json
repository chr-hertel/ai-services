It\u0027s less than the sum of its parts, and a somewhat cumbersome amalgamation of solid performances and good ideas, but without any clear narrative thread. I don\u0027t think it would be unreasonable to assume that the film was heavily influenced by the success of Fred Zinnemann\u0027s \u0027From Here to Eternity (1953).\u0027 Both take a strict military environment and include sparing snippets of war-time conflict, but focus largely on the issue of military authority. However, \u0027The Caine Mutiny,\u0027 perhaps aiming to match Lancaster/Kerr or Clift/Reed, also attempts a clumsy romantic subplot, which feels too poorly-developed to have any lasting relevance with the rest of the story.\n\nHumphrey Bogart, as one would expect, gives the film\u0027s most memorable performance, his continually-paranoid and antagonistic leadership eliciting a curious mix of hatred and pity. Even so, Bogart had already displayed superior talent as a mentally-deteriorating personality in both John Huston\u0027s \u0027The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)\u0027 and Nicholas Ray\u0027s \u0027In a Lonely Place (1950).\u0027 Fred MacMurray is excellent, playing Keefer, a likable would-be novelist and a self-confessed coward, who, rather than overcoming his shortcomings in order to save his friend\u0027s life, unceremoniously abandons and betrays him. Nevertheless, he\u0027s hardly played as a villain, as though the film accepts that this is just the way that some people are.\n\nRobert Francis has enough charisma to be a good supporting player, but he\u0027s simply not strong enough in the lead role. Given time, he might have developed into a big star, but a plane crash in 1955 tragically cut short a promising career. Female co-star May Wynn, aside from having a very good singing voice, is unconvincing in the role of Francis\u0027 sweetheart, her acting appearing strained in many of the romance\u0027s most intense moments, which aren\u0027t, in actual fact, very intense at all. José Ferrer makes an impressive second-billed cameo appearance at the film\u0027s climax, playing the lawyer who dutifully defends the accused mutineer, but resents the ship\u0027s officers for facilitating, through their own inaction, Cmdr. Queeg\u0027s illness; I liked how the conclusion shrewdly blurred the lines of villainy and heroism.\n\nThe film\u0027s strongest scenes are those that involve Bogart, as his character, a \"ticking time-bomb\" of denial and paranoia, threatens to destroy all those under his command, and I particularly liked the use of the ball bearings to signify Queeg\u0027s escalating nervousness. Nevertheless, Edward Dmytryk, as a director, has yet to impress me as much as I would have liked him to. From the three pictures of his that I\u0027ve seen  the other two being the hard-boiled noir \u0027Murder, My Sweet (1944)\u0027 and the climbing adventure \u0027The Mountain (1956)\u0027  he tends to strike me as a very workman-like filmmaker. He gets the job done, of course, and often does a good job of it, but you\u0027d be tentative about blindly choosing one of his films from the DVD shelf. However, I\u0027m perfectly happy to accept recommendations for any Dmytryk films that might break this general mould.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
