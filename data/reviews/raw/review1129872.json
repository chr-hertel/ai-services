This is one of the 2 movies that the Cirque has made, and even though it doe not has a lot of budget they make a enjoyable movie. There\u0027s a great performance by Julie Cox, who before this was a little unknown, and she might not have a lot of fame but after this it gave her a good point in her \"Resume√©\". And this other unknown-movie actor Rene Bazinet, who had formerly played in another Cirque show, \"Saltimbanco\", who gives a funny and charming performance. It isn\u0027t a Must-see movie but a pleasant-to-see.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
