Obviously, this documentary was made as a result of Moore\u0027s Farenheit 911, although aspects of it is similar to Roger \u0026 Me. Wilson could have, and possibly should have titled his film, \"Michael \u0026 Me\" since the most controversial aspect of it is the title itself. Certainly, Moore could not have taken issue with such a title since he himself lifted his film\u0027s title from Ray Bradbury\u0027s classic \"Farenheit 451\".\n\nOverall, it is a highly entertaining examination of Moore\u0027s rationale behind his film making style and subject matter. Instead of leading the audience to a single, specific and politically one-sided conclusion as Moore\u0027s films do, it challenges the audience to think for themselves and not necessarily take the word of the film maker as gospel,including Wilson\u0027s film. I feel the film maker respected my intelligence and my time.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
