Thought it was REALLY intense and suspenseful with some really cool set-pieces. Diane Lane is excellent and it has lots of \"SE7EN\"-esque moments (including LOTS of rain and a grimy look). There is a very palpable sense of foreboding and dread that I haven\u0027t really witnessed since Fincher\u0027s classic and maybe \"Silence of the Lambs\".\n\nAnyway, it won\u0027t win any Oscars but it is well worth a look IMHO. Very creepy and dark, but entertaining and thought provoking. Diane is excellent in it!\n\nRecommended. Go see it! 9/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
