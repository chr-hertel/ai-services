But there\u0027s hardly any sense of dramatic tension, much less urgency. Indeed, the movie seems almost like an anthropological documentary, in which the camera spends much of its time dispassionately observing the behavior of ordinary folks at work and play, with little indication that the story is going anywhere in particular.\n\nAnd then, with only minutes of running time to spare, out of the clear blue sky comes the (absurdly far-fetched) revelation that seals the protagonist\u0027s tragic fate.\n\nThere is much of interest here for students of film, or of the period of the Thirties, or of the movie\u0027s settings of town and port in Mexico. There\u0027s little psychological depth, though, and the most intriguing question about this \"iconic\" representative of the \"film of sinners\" genre is, What (aside from the boob shot) made such a seemingly dull story so compelling for the filmgoing public of its day?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
