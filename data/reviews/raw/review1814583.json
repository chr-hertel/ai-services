I think there are several weak factors:\n\n1. Sympathy for the protagonists: The time of introducing characters and building a relationship to them is too short respectively not efficiently used. You can\u0027t really know and like the family, neither understand its dynamics. Even if this is wanted by the makers, it brings you to be not very moved by the actually \"thrilling moments\".\n\n2. Motivation: Point 1 implements also that you can\u0027t follow the motivation of the leading characters. This is, in part, surely necessary to heighten the suspense. But when all tricks were revealed, I still wasn\u0027t satisfied with the given answers.\n\n3. The clever viewer: Fortunately, this movie is not predictable. But anyone with half a brain will expect some turning points and every \"thriller-used\" viewer can guess at some more or less particular time in which direction the resting film will go. In addition, the time and form of the turnings aren\u0027t as twisting as they should/could be.\n\nIn summary: I think in this movie a good working story was wasted by an unfinished constellation of characters and the missing insight into them.\n\nHowever, my rating says it: You can enjoy watching this, and if you don\u0027t, you won\u0027t miss it.\n\n(Sorry for bad English, long ago..)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
