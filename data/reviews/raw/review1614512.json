One of them is the fact that Forrest Gump is currently #81 on the list, and a movie that wasn\u0027t bad, but not nearly as good as this called Fight Club, was #31! The other thing was that Forrest Gump was so low on the top 250 list. I think it should be in the top 20, right up there with Goodfellas, but it\u0027s not!! Tom Hanks basically had a star turning role in this film. It\u0027s one of his best performances to date and he didn\u0027t even make the top 20? The movie was a mixture of comedy and drama, something that is so hard to do and seldomly keeps the story in place, but Forrest Gump did. This was brilliantly casted and very well directed.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
