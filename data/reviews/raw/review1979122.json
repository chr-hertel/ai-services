But, most likely, it was not fated to become true therefore as film has left negative impression. And that is why.\n\nIf to begin with a plot here it is necessary to tell, that anything new Stephanie Mayer has not thought up: love between the vampire and the usual, mortal girl and serious troubles because of it. But the director of the given picture had an excellent chance to create beautiful story to the spectator; so that it was interesting to him and bewitched him. Alas, it was not possible.\n\nProbably, main reason is worthless game of actors both their improbable retorts and dialogues. Especially I was amazed with the beginning of film when protagonists cannot connect even two words to get acquainted. Of course, I understand that they maybe rather shy persons but in the senior classes it is time to learn how to communicate with people.\n\nAs if to actors I was simply in a shock. I did not expect such sheer failure from Kristen Stewart. In my opinion,she has played disgustingly. Even more I was amazed with Robert Pattinson: too nervous the vampire has turned out from him. But new faces, in particular, executors of roles of members of family of eternally seventeen-year-old vampire have obviously pleased. Have perfectly consulted with the work. Offset.\n\nIn the conclusion, I wish to note one more obvious plus of the picture - the magnificent nature. It has added mysticism and romanticism in this tiresome and tightened film.\n\n3/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
