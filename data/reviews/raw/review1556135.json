A young police officer flips and becomes his country\u0027s most notorious bank robber. Seems rather far fetched but it happened in South Africa in the late 1970s/early 1980s when Police Captain Andre Stander became his country\u0027s most famous bank robber and is pretty faithfully retold in this film, although a few details are left out.\n\nThomas Jane excels in the leading role and it\u0027s kind of hard to think that this is the same guy who played cardboard cut out Carter in Deep Blue Sea and unlike most Americans playing South Africans (particularly Afrikaners) hits the accent perfectly as does the extremely beautiful and talented Canadian Deborah Kara Unger as Stander\u0027s estranged wife Bekkie.\n\nSouth Africa itself makes a fantastic backdrop to the film, from the rich Johannesburg suburbs, the black shanty towns and the wide sweeping landscapes. Against this though however is the grittiness of Stander\u0027s crimes and imprisonment filmed brilliantly and the film\u0027s standout scene a reconstruction of the 1976 riots which will make your stomach turn. It also stays faithful to the period and the ways of life under Apartheid and if anything shows how a corrupt system can turn it\u0027s most loyal subjects.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
