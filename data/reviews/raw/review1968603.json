For the final version of High School Musical, the Disney crowd released it to the theater instead of television. The decision was a no-brainer, the various road company High School Musical performers have been doing great business wherever they appeared including my home city. And certainly the box office for High School Musical 3 has justified this decision.\n\nBut this is the end for this particular class, the six stars are already way too old for High School Musical 3, we\u0027ve got to graduate them. In the cast are the new people getting ready to take over for Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens, Corbin Bleu, Monique Coleman, Ashley Tisdale, and Lucas Grabeel. \n\nThey are going out with style however and the plot such as it is has the cool kids from East High competing for a scholarship to the Julliard School of Music. Two representatives from Julliard will be at the senior show to award a scholarship and you already know that scheming Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) is going to do whatever it takes to get that scholarship.\n\nIn fact Tisdale\u0027s quest for the scholarship sets her up with an All About Eve twist in this plot. Jemma McKenzie-Brown plays a new girl from London who attachs herself to Tisdale. Now if any of the teen crowd that likes the High School Musical reads this review and decides to check out All About Eve, I will have done my job.\n\nIn fact the eventual decision of the judges is quite a good one and to appreciate it you would have had to see all three films.\n\nHigh School Musical 3 is an appealing film as the others are, but it creates an incredible fantasy world which I can tell you didn\u0027t exist when I went to high school lo these many years ago. And supposedly we\u0027re far more sophisticated now and like realism in our cinema.\n\nBut those who\u0027ve followed the series, see the original Wildcats one more time.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
