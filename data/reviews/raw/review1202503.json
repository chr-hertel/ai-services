I was surprised that the movie was made in the reasonably recent wake of the very popular BBC TV mini series with Colin Firth\u0027s Darcy, but I\u0027m glad it was.\n\nThe film, like the series, had awe inspiring landscapes and stately home settings. My favourite was a scene in the Peak District with Keira Knightley just standing on some rocks on a hill. The difference between this version of \"Pride and Prejudice\" and the others was the faultless acting. Keira captured Elizabeth Bennett\u0027s persona as I had read her: highly intelligent, opinionated and with a strong sense of playful mischief. Matthew MacFadyen had Darcy\u0027s arrogance, but also a credible sense of vulnerability which made one believe that Elizabeth could have fallen for him. I was left wondering in other versions how on earth Elizabeth could have any feelings beyond gratitude for Darcy because he still remained very contained. Brenda Blethyn was perfect as the mother: a role very easy to overact as Mrs Bennett\u0027s character is so crass.\n\nAnother aspect I liked about this film is that it truly reflected the family in their status of genteel poverty. They have a lovely home, but it is rather the worse for wear. One thing I had to chuckle at though was the state of the farm. I can\u0027t believe that anyone would let their yard get into such a scruffy state, no matter how little money they had! A surprisingly good film. My husband enjoyed it very much also, ergo not your standard period drama for the girls.\n\n9/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
