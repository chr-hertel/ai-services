Sharon stone made sex so unappealing. and wasn\u0027t the first one like 14 years ago. yeah it was, i was 13 then and totally had the hots for Sharon stone, of course now shes like 50 and desperately trying to be sexy. and somehow people think she still is. i guess the majority has set their standards very very low. anyways the budget for this movie could\u0027ve went to starving Africans or something of that nature. boo hoo!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
