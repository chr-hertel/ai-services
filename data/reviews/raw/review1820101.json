The only reason I gave it a 2 is for the somewhat good gore factor ... That\u0027s it. Awful acting, the zombies were a cross between spider-man and EVERY ghost in the endless stream of Japanese horror remakes as they have the super ability to crawl on walls and ceilings. Mena Suvari as the tough military girl just didn\u0027t cut it either. I think after this atrocity in film making she will be lucky to land supporting rolls in Sci-Fi originals for the remainder of her career. There was absolutely nothing original about this film. Just another sub-par movie trying to capitalize on a legendary title. I hope George Romero never sees this piece of garbage.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
