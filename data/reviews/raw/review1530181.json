I thought that such a familiar set of actors would interfere with the authenticity but it doesn\u0027t at all! Their vignettes are all well-portrayed and add to the many moods of the film. These subplots play a perfect backdrop to the main event.The vintage clips are riveting as well as the many now-prophetic words of Bobby Kennedy that pepper the film.\n\nBe prepared to feel many different emotions, almost as if it were 1968 all over again (aided, in part, by a glorious 60s soundtrack). Bobby, like the man it\u0027s about, is a winner. If only we had the man instead of the myth today, what a better country and people we would be.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
