I am told they were all on speed, and were almost arrested as the hotel Switchboard listened to the duchess make deals. Warhol exploited people and that is fine if you like to be exploited. WHich everyone in the film was. Later when Edie Sedgwick tried to break away and have her footage cut out and refused to make movies anymore, she was banned from the studio when Warhol was profiting very well from the movies. When Mary Woronov tried to break away she was thrown down a flight of stairs, when she asked for profits from the movies. Warhol was a sadistic \"artist\" talented or not who exploited people. Later when Edie was had finally broke away from him he said\"I wish I could film her committing suicide\". WHat a great friend. I wish Edie were still alive and he was so she could smack him in the head" }
