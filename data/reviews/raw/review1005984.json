Maxwell, GODS AND GENERALS is a gargantuan enterprise which recreates an important moment in history, like the widescreen epics of a bygone era. It\u0027s reverent, dignified, staid, humorless and dull.\n\nThe movie\u0027s major stumbling block is Gen. Jackson himself, a brave but contradictory man, given to using religious doctrine as an excuse for his zealous pursuit of victory, and his pious devotions are both sanctimonious and bland. Maxwell\u0027s screenplay (based on a book by Jeffrey M. Shaara) clarifies a wealth of important details, and gives both sides an opportunity to argue their case for war, but it refuses to shrink from the hypocrisy of Confederate attitudes - they prize freedom above all other values, including the \u0027freedom\u0027 to enslave an entire race of people - while Jackson himself is portrayed as a liberal-minded fellow who hopes to see an end to slavery one day (though not before he\u0027s killed as many Federal soldiers as possible, because of their \u0027wicked\u0027 insistence on ending it sooner rather than later). Unfortunately, Jackson\u0027s liberalism plays like a sop to modern audiences who might otherwise have viewed him as a racist...\n\nThe hollow melodramatics are emphasized by an intrusive music score (by John Frizzell and Randy Edelman) which swells repeatedly at every juncture, but the movie only comes to life during the noisy battle scenes (depicted with the help of various societies devoted to historical re-enactments), while the actors - including Jeff Daniels as Lt. Col. Joshua Chamberlain (the central \u0027character\u0027 in GETTYSBURG), Robert Duvall as Robert E. Lee, and a huge cast of familiar faces, many of whom don\u0027t even rate a screen credit! - struggle mightily with their Olde Worlde dialogue, peppered with soul-stirring speeches about the dignity and tragedy of dying for a noble cause. Spare us.\n\nAnyone looking for an entertaining Civil War epic should check out the TV miniseries NORTH AND SOUTH (1985) and its sequels, all of which bear a striking visual resemblance to Maxwell\u0027s pageant, but aren\u0027t so po-faced and disingenuous.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
