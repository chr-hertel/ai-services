Although it is a film worth watching, for River\u0027s performance if nothing else, its accredited greatness is no more than a wishfully constructed social myth.\n\nI wish I could say how truly remarkable the film is, but to be honest it lacks substance, it leaves you yearning for something moreÂ…I think much of the talent in the film is unexploited to its best potential and the dialogue, in its second half, written in a kind of impromptu, mock Shakespeare, is devoid of any magic.\n\nOverall the film is watch-able and has some great shots, like that at the beginning where the viewer joins Mike (River Phoenix) toward the end of a blow-job he\u0027s receiving from a john; when he comes the image of an entire house being dropped onto a desolate highway charges the screen.It\u0027s sad and beautiful, and, is a perfect statement on Mike\u0027s yearning for a home he never had.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
