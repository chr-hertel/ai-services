A truly moving and harrowing journey both through the troubled mind of Don Rambo and the badly criticised Taliban. For once the people of Afghanistan are shown in their true light. At the first scene we realise Rambo has become a coward, stick-fighting a blind man to con money for his new order of monks. But that is not too last, when his lover and once great teacher Colonel Trouthead is held to ransom he soon remembers his true calling and dons the red headband that gives him is super powers. If you are thinking this is merely another over hyped action flick, then i assure you, you are truly mistaken. Rambo 3 is a deeply moving drama concerned with the misunderstood sexual relationships of todays gays in wartime (think broke-back mountain meets platoon). Of course the action is also of a high standard and Stallone\u0027s muscly sweating body holds the cameras attention throughout much of this, providing a highly sexual and provocative (yet subtle) twist to the film. my thanks also go to the producers of this fantastic epic for finally giving trout head and Rambo a decent of amount of screen time together and allowing the sexual undertones of the first two movies ( where their previous relationship was often merely hinted at ) to finally explode into full on man love. the scene where trout head asks Rambo \" does it hurt john \" and Rambo tenderly replies \"no sir \" made me stand and cheer and I\u0027m not afraid to admit i cried. all in all a must see for any young gays out there ( possibly in the armed services themselves) who aren\u0027t afraid to stand up and be counted", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
