Matt Damon was really good as Donny. Great film and well worth watching. The film had some interesting parts about the Vatican and the procedure involved in electing a new pope, people who are not of that particular religion may learn something new. The humour though puerile at times is along the same lines as American Pie, if you like American Pie, you will love this film! Maybe it\u0027s just our sense of humour but we have watched it every time it\u0027s been on sky and still laugh at the same parts. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
