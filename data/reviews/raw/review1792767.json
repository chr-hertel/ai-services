There was a compelling and believable storyline (think of \"Body Heat\" set in a contemporary northeastern city instead of lazy Miami), it was well acted and a real thriller. I especially liked LL Cool J\u0027s performance, and Liotta was believable as the White urban politico. I also liked that the movie didn\u0027t shy away from comments (however simplistic) about race. Mekhi Pfifer was useful in his role and Taye Diggs was hilarious with his usual witty and sarcastic commentary. The female lead, Blalock also gives a believable performance as damsel in distress. The Desk Sgt. Drown character was quite funny. Comparable (but better) films would include \"Double Indemnity\" or The \"Postman Always Rings Twice\". This was a good yarn, well worth the 3 bucks I spent to rent it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
