Disney throws us another inspirational true story ... this time about South Philly\u0027s Vince Papale, a local bartender who was a walk-on cult hero for the Philadelphia Eagles in the late 1970\u0027s. Think \"Rudy\" in South Philly or \"Rocky\" in football pads.\n\nMarky Mark does a passable job as local hero and good guy Vince, who is just one of the guys in this struggling town. First time film director Ericson Core does a passable Disney job of providing a bit of the feel of these hard nosed, blue collar people who struggle with life but always find a way to support their Eagles.\n\nThe story picks up when Eagles owner Leonard Tose (played by Miohael Nouri, who is seen in the current \"Boynton Beach Club\") hires UCLA hot shot coach Dick Vermeil (played well by underrated actor Greg Kinnear), following the Eagles miserable 1975 season. We get a few hints at the legendary brutal Philly sports fans and a small glimpse of home life for Vermeil, but most of the film centers on Papale and his personal struggles and his group of mostly supportive friends.\n\nPapale\u0027s love interest and future wife is played by the remarkable Elizabeth Banks (so wonderful in \"The Baxter\" and \"40 Year Old Virgin\") who, even though a Giants fan, seems to fit right in with this group of tough guys and, of course, immediately spots and falls for Vince\u0027s soft heart.\n\nDon\u0027t miss Sports Illustrated\u0027s Rick Reilly as a disgruntled Eagles fan and just see this one to enjoy the uplifting story and inspirational message it delivers. A soft PG-13 makes it OK for most kids who would have any interest in seeing it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
