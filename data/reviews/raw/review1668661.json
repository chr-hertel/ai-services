Er, no thanks", "reviewBody": "performance wise, this game just doesn\u0027t seem to run well on any computer i\u0027ve ever had. first i had a p3 with 512mb and a geforce fx 5200. performance was pretty poor. and i put it down to the hardware i had at the time. since then, i have also had the opportunity to play this game on an Intel Pentium d with 1 gig of ram and a radeon x300. i\u0027m at a loss, as there wouldn\u0027t be that many PCs up to this spec in 2002, yet still the performance is not good. no, there\u0027s just something not quite right about this at all.\n\naside from being extremely sluggish in the graphics department, the same can be said for the controls etc. in a big way. this is one of the most unresponsive racing games i have ever seen. people talk about this being \u0027realistic\u0027, but i\u0027m sorry real cars just do not behave like this. you try to turn the wheel all the way round, and yet the car just seems to slowly veer off to one side. very slow acceleration which is highly frustrating. if this is truly realistic, then i\u0027d much rather play super Mario kart, thank you very much.\n\nthe tracks are highly boring and mostly just look like any old unremarkable American highway. too much space, to open, not enough sharp bends. oh, i forgot, you couldn\u0027t put any sharper bends in, because the car simply wouldn\u0027t be able to manoeuvre round them. no, i\u0027m not kidding, you\u0027d probably have to do a 3 point turn. how do these people get off their drives, i wonder? \n\nnope, this game sucks, IMO. if you want a really good racing game, then buy v-rally 2. though, nobody seems to have played it much. and looking around on the net, it\u0027s almost as if it never really existed. much the same with a lot of other things in this world, great things get swept under the carpet, while sucky things get high praise" }
