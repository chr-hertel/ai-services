This family is hilarious. I\u0027m not usually a big fan of shows like that -- only watched \"The Osbourne\u0027s\" once or twice, just to see what all the fuss was about. I read a review and decided to check out the show and have not been disappointed. Not a dysfunctional family (how refreshing) -- pretty typical, actually. But really, really funny. Gene\u0027s ego is soooo big and I love how they have fun with that. The driving episode had me laughing so hard I had tears. My 17 year old son really likes it too. I\u0027m recommending it to all of my friends. Hopefully, they won\u0027t run out of ideas and get enough buzz going to keep this one on the air.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
