The acting was really good and I just loved this movie. It\u0027s one of those movies you could watch again and again without getting tired of it. Towards the end it makes more sense, in the beginning of the movie you\u0027re not quiet sure what the heck everyone\u0027s doing.\n\nOut of ten I\u0027ve give Saw a nine. I suggest you watch the movie unless you really can\u0027t gore and horror.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
