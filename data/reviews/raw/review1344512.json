He and then-little-known Caroline Catz now of The Bill, The Vice and Doc Martin star as a couple who strike up an conversation in an American-style diner in London. I recall it being black-and-white with occasional red, similar to Schindler\u0027s List or Sin City, but less, well, heart-wrenching or violent.\n\nThe film riffs initially on taking chances and trusting strangers maybe more than your friends, but then takes two rather sharp twists, at least one of which is rather disturbing.\n\nMac really isn\u0027t all that he seems.\n\nIt\u0027s hard to review this without spoiling the main twist, so I\u0027ll stick to some choice memories: \"You ain\u0027t no n*gger to be calling no n*gger a n*gger\" as the faux-American (uncredited on IMDb, so I can\u0027t reference him, sorry!) black man who wants to be a hard guy retorts indignantly to super-slimy nasty guy Harley, played effortlessly by Jesse Birdsall (again ubiquitous in 90s British television).\n\nThe origin of China\u0027s name.\n\nMac and China circling each other in her flat, one flapping, the other imitating.\n\nIt\u0027s worth a watch if you can get hold of it (and if you can, let me know - I only saw it once, late at night on TV and it stayed with me!).", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
