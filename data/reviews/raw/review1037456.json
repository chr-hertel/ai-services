Most of the stories, despite being written by Psycho scribe Robert Bloch, are on the level of really lame episodes of The Twilight Zone. \n\nThe only stand-out is the Poe story, and Jack Palance\u0027s hammy creepy performance; this is one of my most favorite things the character actor has ever done, and it completely goes against \"type,\" creating a hysterical, utterly nutty character of the stripe Vincent Price usually plays. Cushing is also good in this story, but he\u0027s playing straight man to Palance so he doesn\u0027t have a whole lot to do other than be foreboding and \"Cushingly.\" The Poe segment was really on the level of the AIP Poe anthologies, and would have fit right in.\n\nMention should also be made of Burgess Meredith as \"Dr. Diablo,\" who gleefully exudes evil and chews the scenery while wearing a top-hat and smoking from a long cigarette-holder (not unlike the Penguin character he was playing at the same time on the Batman TV series). However, Meredith\u0027s cackling ham isn\u0027t enough to recommend this film for anything other than the Poe segment. And as far as the Amicus end-of-movie twists go, the one in this movie is pretty lame. My advice is to fast-forward to Poe, then fast-forward towards the end framing-sequence which briefly picks up the Poe thread once again.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
