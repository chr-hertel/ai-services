This is some of the worst writing/acting/directing/\"horror\" I have ever seen in my life. I keep watching this series expecting there to be something redeeming, but I think that this has single handedly made me give up on it entirely.\n\nIf you like horror, then you will hate this film.\n\nIf you like cinema in general, then you will hate this film.\n\nIf you like Peter Jackson films (or if you\u0027re just a frat boy who watches scary movies for the girl on girl action), then, by all means, watch and enjoy.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
