It\u0027s done for pretty cheap (you can sometimes tell this and sometimes it looks like it has a budget?!) but there\u0027s some really good work in this movie from the actors in it. And it\u0027s got a nice groove once it gets going.\n\nI guess even though Nixon is sorta in the background of this movie\u0027s lost desert weekend, the ex-president\u0027s woes seem just as tragic as the Boxer (Rhomeyn Johnson) and Musician\u0027s (Rob Arbogast). Their weird, funny, and troubled vibe is one of the main reasons to see this.\n\nThere are no big names in this either, but maybe that\u0027s okay in the end since nobody in this has any baggage to ruin it. It makes it feel more real.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
