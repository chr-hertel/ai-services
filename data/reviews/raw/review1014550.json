I\u0027m delighted that they have FANTASTIC musical actors in this movie like Bernadette Peters (whom I absolutely adore), Jason Alexander, and Whitney Houston. But the thing is that Brandy just cannot act. A character like Cinderella has to be loved by everyone for the movie to be great, but she made Cinderella sound weak with her soft, breathy vocals. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I like Brandy as a singer. But she doesn\u0027t bring anything to the role of Cinderella, and quite frankly, she brought the movie down. She can\u0027t act well at all. She could have done well had it been a high school production, but there are thousands of actresses and singers who could have done a better job. It could have been great, but it really, really wasn\u0027t. Not to mention that there was a lot of color, but it was all too much to handle--it was just blues and purples and pinks.\n\nIt\u0027s worth watching for Bernadette Peters of course, and the stepsisters are hysterical. Jason Alexander is quite comical as always, and the king and queen are great examples of some of today\u0027s parents. Overall, it\u0027s a good movie, especially for the younger little kids, but don\u0027t get your hopes high before watching.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
