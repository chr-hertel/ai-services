Sacha Baron Cohen gave him a great personality. i still have \"i like to move it move it\" stuck in my head!!! the penguins were pretty funny, too. the visuals were pretty cool. it was like you were actually in New York and Madagascar!!! probably because Dreamworks is really talented. i mean, who could forget Shrek??? there was a few corny jokes in the movie. but overall,i give it big two paws up! go and see it!!! especially if you have young kids, or just like to have a fun time!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
