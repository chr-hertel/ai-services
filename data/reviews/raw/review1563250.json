A number of game types were sacrificed in the process, only the 2D fighter (Street Fighter Alpha), Side Scroller (G-Darius), and platformer (Oddworld) manage to survive one last generation. To my knowledge there has not been a game with 2D gameplay released on any subsequent consoles.\n\nAbe\u0027s Oddysee and Exodus use the Playstation\u0027s capabilities to provide rich backgrounds and slickly animated characters, all integrated with seamless cutscenes. There have been no games like them before or since (Munch\u0027s Oddysee included). Another World, Flashback, Heart of Darkness, Abe\u0027s Oddysee and Abe\u0027s Exodus represent the last of an era (and not forgotten by gamesplayers of the time)." }
