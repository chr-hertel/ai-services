However, the comment went on to indicate an overall liking of the story, and other production of same. Well, this person isn\u0027t the \"only one,\" who didn\u0027t like this production (include me!) but there I part company even with him/her. If you put a gun to my head and asked me to make a choice between your shooting me or watching this flick again, I\u0027d watch it, certainly - but I\u0027d probably spend 10 seconds thinking about it. I\u0027d much prefer being locked into solitary confinement, or having to watch paint dry on a wall, though. Further, I wouldn\u0027t want to see this story again, anytime, anywhere, or in any alternative presentation. Sometimes you feel like comedian George Gobel\u0027s \"pair of brown shoes when the rest of the world is a tuxedo,\" and this is one of those for me. I liked Angela Lansbury in a favorite movie of mine, \"Long Hot Summer,\" and while not a huge fan of the show, enjoyed \"Murder, She Wrote.\" But HERE -- I not only didn\u0027t care for the story or other aspects, but I found Angela\u0027s squealing, squawking, singing, and everything else about her over-the-top performance, perhaps the MOST ANNOYING presence in any movie (or presentation in any other media) I\u0027ve ever experienced. It was like an unending continuation of Audrey Hepburn\u0027s equally \"over-the top\" Cockney chortling at Rex Harrison - in the earlier portions of \"My Fair Lady.\" But that was incident to the plot, presented for light, comedic effect, and (mercifully) brief. Unmercifully, this was anything but brief, and to me seemed as if it had gone-on for about 10 hours (Einstein\u0027s layman\u0027s explanation of \"relativity\" at work.) If I hadn\u0027t been with friends, with the necessity to remain, MY viewing would have been brief. I laughed, though, at the \"Seinfeld\" episode where Elaine pisses everyone off because she tells them how much she disliked \"The English Patient.\" My friends somewhat regarded me the same way when I interrupted their waxing ecstatically over this movie. Give me some dragging fingernails loudly over a chalk board anytime instead.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
