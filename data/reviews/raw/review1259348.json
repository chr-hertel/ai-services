Attal started by creating interesting, complex, and even likable characters but was not able to shed any light on his premise, that is \u0027does or can monogamy work and if how\u0027 and cops out in the end with a nonsensical elevator ride into the sky with Gabrielle and l\u0027inconnu Johnny Depp inside. Attal was able to set up its premise nicely during the first half of the movie, then, like feeling himself that he actually has nothing to say really, tried to save the day with whimsical \u0027musical\u0027 numbers, mostly terrible sentimental songs to terrible sentimental montages. He might have tried to make ironical statements with that but it comes over as if he\u0027s trying to appeal to the masses and feed them some \u0027Amalie\u0027 moments. The film presents itself very energetic from the beginning, with excellent cinematography and lighting, though a bit too fast cut. All female roles - with the exceptions of Attals real world wife Charlotte Gainsbourg seem to be afterthoughts as he himself admits in an interview and it shows. While they could have added some insight into the \u0027premise\u0027 they haven\u0027t been asked to do so by the writer/director.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
