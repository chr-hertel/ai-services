The guy definitely tries to take a stance about lack of morals and honesty, but he can\u0027t find the means to take it to a significant conclusion.\n\nSadly it all got lost among the other Romanian films in those awful years when the old dinosaurs were on their way to the gutter.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
