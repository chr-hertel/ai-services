However, when Gibson burst forth with his vile anti-semitic rant last week, I thought now is the time to compare the movie with the rant. On a vileness scale the movie comes in as a 10 to the rant\u0027s 8.\n\nBut, my biggest objection is that this movie is just not believable. To depict Pilate as afraid (or even moderately respectful) of Caiphas is a joke. Remember, Judea was a militarily occupied land. Pilate was Caesar\u0027s number one boy, beholden only to Caesar. Jesus was a local do-gooder, upsetting the Roman realm. An early times Gandhi, Martin Luther King.\n\nFairy tales are succor for the faithful, so I guess if you\u0027re more interested in faith than fact this one is right up your street.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
