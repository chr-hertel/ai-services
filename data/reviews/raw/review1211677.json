Danes, Martin, and Schwartzman, as well as the supporting cast, were all good in their roles. Martin as a screenwriter is subtle but makes his point about the transformative power of love.\n\nFrom the opening credits to the end of the movie, Martin shows us a culture in which everything is bought and sold as a commodity. His characters fall into this trap in varying degrees. You will have to see the movie to see those who are able to pull themselves out of this trap and those who cannot.\n\nIn this film, Martin combines his unique absurd yet understated brand of humor, his passion for the fine arts and beauty, and his compassion for people\u0027s foibles. Give it a try.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
