If you have not seen Laguna Beach on MTV you should see it.My favorite character on Laguna Beach is Lauren or LC she doesn\u0027t care about the drama and she has a great house and she likes this bad boy Jason who she used to date. Lauren and Jason may be together.Lauren also stars in her own TV show on MTV called the Hills and it stars one of her best friends Heidi and she gets to work at Teen Vogue and where she meets a new friends and she likes a boy who doesn\u0027t like her. Lauren might be on Laguna Beach season 3 but she might not be you never know.Lauren gives good advice to her sister and her sister\u0027s friends about high school and how to forget about the boys and don\u0027t get carried away by the drama. Laguna Beach first season was all about Lauren and her friends. The second season follows Lauren and Jason and how they both like each other. Lauren and Jason would have got married if Jason didn\u0027t make the big mistake by kissing Jessica right in front of Lauren." }
