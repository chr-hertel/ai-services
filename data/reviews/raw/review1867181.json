I\u0027m fairly certain at least over 90% if not all of the villages and towns have leaders democratically elected. (Note: the government usually don\u0027t pick the candidates, but voting fraud happen from time to time from what I heard. Yes, this is what happens when there\u0027s a democracy without proper voter education and regulations, most importantly, without a real voting culture. people just buy votes.) Therefore I have no reason to question the authenticity of this documentary. Common, it\u0027s an election between three third graders.If you think Chinese government care enough to stage this documentary you are most definitely paranoid.\n\nThis documentary itself actually made cases for both pro-democracy and anti-democracy arguments. On one hand, it\u0027s scary to have uneducated voters and unregulated voting process in a democracy; on another hand, without real democracy, the imitation can only be so crude and cruel.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
