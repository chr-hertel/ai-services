I really enjoy his films and with the exception of \u0027Signs\u0027, I have always found so much to think about and talk about after. This is no exception and I was pleasantly surprised after having read the reviews.\n\nIf you liked the mellow side of Sixth Sense, and the un-Hollywood drama of Lady in the Water, then I think you will enjoy this film. I know that it has been said that the characters react in very odd ways  but I would say that this was a lot more true to life. There is a real Hitchcock feel to the whole thing. If he was making films now, this is what I think he would be doing.\n\nI\u0027ve never seen Mark Wahlberg in a bad film, and this is no exception. From the way he deals with his students at the beginning, to the way his character adapts to the tale as it unfolds  it\u0027s all excellent stuff. The reaction of other characters - from their voyeuristic fascination, to their complete non-reaction, was refreshingly realistic.\n\nI haven\u0027t enjoyed a film this much since Lord of the Rings. It\u0027s not an action movie, - it is more intelligent than that.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
