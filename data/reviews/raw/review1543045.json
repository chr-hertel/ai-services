I like Glenn Close, and she gives a powerful character reference as lawyer Teddy Barnes, and the \u0027did he or didn\u0027t he?\u0027 storyline is very intriguing. The \u0027jagged edge\u0027 role is interestingly portrayed by Jeff Bridges, and the movie details a sensational court case and the trials and tribulations of either believing in your morals or in your heart. But sometimes your heart rules your head, and maybe that\u0027s not a good thing....\n\nJagged Edge is a jagged movie, a little rough around the edges, but smoothing out to a reasonable sense of conclusion.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
