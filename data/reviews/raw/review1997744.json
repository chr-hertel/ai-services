It was recorded off a VHS recording of a late night showing off some Los Angles TV station however it is in color and better than not having it.\n\nWell I tried leaving the link but this web site had a problem with it. Seems it didn\u0027t like the word Snowfire in the link itself and my text was too short ten lines minimum.\n\nSo where you find it is go to the I offer web site and search Snowfire in all categories among the books there will be a seller named TV time machine the picture of the white horse isn\u0027t snowfire\u0027s but the movie is the 1958 movie with the megowan family" }
