It proves that you don\u0027t need big names to make a film that will have lasting appeal. Although everyone involved in the film, from directors Bress-Gruber to main actors Ashton Kutcher, Melora Walters and Amy Smart are not household names, they prove to be artists in the truest sense. And the soundtrack is so appropriate. When I decided to watch the movie, I was admittedly skeptical that something so obscure could be as powerful as a friend described it to be. But my friend was right. The Butterfly Effect is that rare gem of a movie that entertains while giving the viewer food for thought. The edition that I borrowed from my local DVD club had an accompanying disc with interviews where renowned academics define the \"butterfly effect.\" The movie and the accompanying interviews are a truly thought-provoking experience.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
