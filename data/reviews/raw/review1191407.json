I was so charmed by Sir Olivier that I believed he was the \"stable boy\" and every time I watched the movie I prayed and hoped he won the love of Kathy back.This is a must see for all generations. Both Ms. Oberon and Sir Olivier gave emotional, awe inspiring performances, along with the supporting cast. In modern times, directors seem to have a difficult time at creating that raw romanticism that makes you feel for the characters without making them sappy. This movie epitomizes the classic flair for romance and emotions in the cinema. The actors were able to take Ms. Bronte\u0027s book and actually duplicate the \"feeling\" into the film. The modern day versions miss the mark when they try to duplicate the same effect on the viewer. Ignore the more recent versions and watch the true classic.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
