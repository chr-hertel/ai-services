He wants to find a copy of the recording that Lauritz Melchiore sang in this movie---something about \"please don\u0027t say no, say maybe...come back in the spring but don\u0027t say maybe...\" I can download to a disc if I know where to go???? I guess I can order the movie also, but one website said not available.\n\nAnyone know?\n\nThanks, Lee Ann", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
