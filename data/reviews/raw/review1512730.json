I thought the acting was superb, i was completely drawn into the scenery, dialogue, and characters. almost sucumbed to what it was like living in 17th century victorian era england. the adaptation to this novel was a complete surprise to my as i had read the book first, and i thought it made the story itself much better with a well to do ending. Let me tell you folks, this movie was created in the golden age of film making, and is truly unique and nothing compared to mass produced and poorly produced crap that is of the 1998 version with paltrow and deniro, among many other disastrous films of our time. I gave this movie a rating out 10 out of 10. Other favorite movies of mine include Obsession, and Nightmare Alley. Please check them out they are unknown gems. feel free to email me if you like this movie or love classic film and want to talk. x083@yahoo.com", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
