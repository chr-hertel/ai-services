People need to lighten up! Also, everyone seems to blame the director, and I admit, I don\u0027t agree with the choice of scenes that he cut from the movie - The film would\u0027ve been better if the scenes had been left alone, but if someone doesn\u0027t like the script or story, then shouldn\u0027t it be the writers to blame and NOT the director (Stuart Baird)? \n\nOK, Nemesis failed at the box office, but that doesn\u0027t make it a bad film, just nobody wanted to see it. How would they know how good or bad something really is without seeing it for themselves? I think audiences just got tired of Star trek in general, and unfortunately, this meant that Nemesis (and Star Trek: Enterprise)had to suffer. Not to mention that it opened at the same time as some SERIOUS competition at the time. Lord of the rings - Harry Potter.\n\nThe only thing that I do agree with is that this wasn\u0027t the best film to end \u0027The Next Gen\u0027 series of films. I think they deserved two or at least one more to wrap things up properly. But I guess that\u0027ll never happen! On a whole, I loved Nemesis (better than Insurrection, even though I like that too) and would give it 10 out of 10 anytime!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
