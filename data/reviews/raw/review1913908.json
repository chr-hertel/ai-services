However, having seen the first movie, I don\u0027t see why there was a need for a film about what happened before. Why does everything need to be explained? \u0027Mou gaan dou\u0027 was quite straightforward and as a stand alone it\u0027s an excellent action thriller. The prequel is a different genre. It\u0027s more a crime drama and it lacks the slickness, steady pace and coherency of the first film, not to forget Lau and Leung\u0027s strong performances. Most of the first hour painfully drags on. While \u0027Mou gaan dou\u0027 centred around Yan and Ming, \u0027Mou gaan dou II\u0027 is mainly about Sam, Wong and Hau (who play their leaders in the first film). Here Yan and Ming are merely supporting characters. Unlike in \u0027Mou gaan dou\u0027, here most of the performances are passable rather than great. Wong and Tsang do a fine job in the leading roles. In addition Ng does a brilliant job too. Lau\u0027s Mary appears to be too sketchy but she does well. Yet, even with the flaws, \u0027Mou gaan dou II\u0027 is not a bad film but rather an okay film because there are some noteworthy sequences especially towards the end where Hau meets his fate and Mary\u0027s murder." }
