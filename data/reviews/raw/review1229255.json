The movie doesn\u0027t glorify her by any stretch, but it doesn\u0027t demonize her either. It\u0027s overall a look at how we are all products of our upbringings. As Wuornos, Theron is almost unrecognizable: she plays a character as unglamorous as can be, with sunburned skin, and girth practically unseen on actresses these days. Christina Ricci is equally good as Wuornos\u0027 companion Selby. These two actresses have accomplished what may be the best roles of their careers. It\u0027s certainly good that Charlize Theron won the Oscar.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
