Enter Scooby-Doo, the wacky, funny great dane. They make him the focus of the series, the counterbalance to the villains, and the rest is history.\n\nI enjoy the many memorable lines, and contrary to what you might think, they\u0027re not just from Shaggy. They include Daphne saying to the Swamp Witch, \"You can\u0027t believe everything you read\" or Freddie saying to Shaggy as he\u0027s trying to get into the museum to see the Knight, \"That\u0027s it, no more jack.\" Just a great series, especially if you enjoy the quirks and sayings of the late 60\u0027s/early 70\u0027s.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
