Theodere.J. Detwiler-The leader. Vince Losall-The athlete. Gretchen Grumbler-The clever one (The brain) Ashley Spinelli-The great fighter (The wrestler). Gus P Griswoll-The boy with the heart. Mikey Blumberg-The poet. My favourite episodes are Here comes Mr perfect,the new kid and King Gus. My favourite characters are Gus,T.J.,Gretchen and Vince but I think Spinelli and Mikey are fantastic too. The gang remind me of me and my friends so I like it even more." }
