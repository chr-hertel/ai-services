The performances were naturalistic, so ahead of there time, and the storytelling is so unpredictable and unorthodox. It\u0027s gushing with black humor so subtle you might miss it if you blink. \u0027The Graduate\u0027 is storytelling at its best, thanks to Mike Nichols perfect direction. It really is a hard film to put a lid on, it\u0027s a film that re-invents comedy genre to this day and in some ways has not been surpassed yet. Just go see it!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
