But watching the cartoon, I thought that it loosely resembled those B-movies in which animals take revenge on humans. It wouldn\u0027t even have to be a case of an atomic test\u0027s causing the animal(s) to turn giant, as was the case in \"Them!\". When you look at how Sam builds his house over Bugs\u0027s rabbit hole, it makes sense that Bugs does what he does. Of course, people for centuries have been building their houses on animals\u0027 homes; therefore, if all animals could do what Bugs does, then we humans would be in big trouble! Although I have to admit that I would consider it an honor to have Bugs trash my life.\n\nWhatever the case, this is a pretty funny cartoon. Friz Freleng certainly created a formidable opponent for Bugs Bunny in the roughest, toughest, he-man stuffest hombre as ever crossed the Rio Grande (and he ain\u0027t no namby-pamby), even if Yosemite Sam was no more competent than Elmer Fudd.
