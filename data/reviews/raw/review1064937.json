Their chemistry together worked very well and you believed what they said and paid attention to every word. As for the other actors: Jason Schwartsman(Spelling???), Mark Whalberg, Jude Law, and Naomi Watts, they are very incredibly wonderful actors. They all dug deep into their roles, the main problem was the fact that the story did not develop their characters. I enjoyed the scene where Lily and Dustin show that Jude\u0027s character, Brad, keeps on talking about the same Shinia Twain story over and over again, his face was priceless. Jude\u0027s character became more interesting after that, and it was too late for me.\n\nThe story was extremely confusing. For the most part I got about 97% of the story, it\u0027s not that hard to follow. But you have to pay attention to this movie, and not snooze off. It\u0027s a good story, but it wasn\u0027t well developed either.\n\nI would recommend this movie for the artsy type. Or for those who enjoy these twisted stories, but I was just not into it. But it was very well made, so I give some credit.\n\n4/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
