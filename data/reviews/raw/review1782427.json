It was like I Robot 2, except more boring. It was like mixing Cast Away with Silent Hill. I mean, it has its good parts, don\u0027t get me wrong. But I fell asleep quite often. Will Smith is a good actor as well, but his masterpiece will always be Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Like I said, a lot of my friends think I\u0027m insane for not liking the movie, and I don\u0027t wanna spoil this movie for anyone, but I probably would have enjoyed Alvin and the Chipmunks better. Let\u0027s just face it, the best movies this year has to be either Superbad or Knocked Up! There hasn\u0027t been a great action thriller since Terminator 2!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
