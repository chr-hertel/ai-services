This is where Penny Wise (Vince Vaughn) has to deal with his own conscience.\n\nScamming people through the phone is what Penny is good at for his job as a telemarketer, and when he was being hired to be part of this million-dollar scam, he was rather being hesitant at first. It\u0027s where his conscience starts to collide.\n\nVery interesting and quirky look at telemarketers who scam for the sake of money. Vince Vaughn portrayed it that well.\n\nGuess I will never see those telemarketers the same way again.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
