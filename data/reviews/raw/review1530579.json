It was actually a pretty good Adam Sandler comedy where he plays a very busy architect always on the go with no time for his family. He burns himself out and receives a super-duper universal remote control from a strange angel (Christopher Walken). Once he has possession of this toy he\u0027s able to fast forward through life\u0027s boring moments, turn the volume down on people he doesn\u0027t want to hear, pause the good times, and so on. But most importantly to me, CLICK actually ultimately had something to say about not rushing through life and taking people you love for granted. I thought I\u0027d be in for 2 hours of nonstop zany toilet shenanigans with Sandler playing with his super-remote and \"clicking\" his way through daily life as he forwards, rewinds, pauses, etc... And of course, that\u0027s largely what I got (and some of it was pretty funny); but I was taken by surprise by the serious and emotional tone it took later on. It became more of a drama in the later stages, much to its credit. For those of us who grew up watching HAPPY DAYS on TV, I was somewhat shocked to see Henry Winkler (\"the Fonz\" himself) now playing the role of Adam Sandler\u0027s dad - and also a grandfather!!!! Where does the time go? If only I had a slow motion button. **1/2 out of ****", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
