Lovely Technicolor cinematography of the outdoor frontier and rich period costuming enhances this top-notch cornucopia of story, score, and songs- including \u0027The Deadwood Stage,\u0027 \u0027I Can Do Without You,\u0027 \u0027Windy City,\u0027 \u0027The Subject of Harry,\u0027 and \u0027Secret Love.\u0027 Two special moments for me are Howard Keel singing \u0027Higher Than A Hawk\u0027 to the portrait of Allyn McLerie, and \u0027A Woman\u0027s Touch,\u0027 which shows McLerie and Doris Day become sisters in solidarity. They clean the house (in fact, renovate it) while discovering Calamity\u0027s femininity at the same time. They joke, they bond, and at the end of the scene our heroine is in a dress and quite the looker. There\u0027s no shocking sexist message here; it\u0027s a musical showing how a woman gets her man. I don\u0027t think in 1953 you could\u0027ve asked for more. On the other hand, most of Day\u0027s scenes with Keel are a locked-horns battle of the sexes- absolutely no question. They compliment each other beautifully- from \u0027I Can Do Without You\u0027, right up to their nearly romantic duet of \u0027The Black Hills of Dakota.\u0027 Enjoy the film again, and look between the lines- some of it is quite timeless.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
