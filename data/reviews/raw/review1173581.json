Yes Danny has an addictive personality, so what? We all have some bizarre behavior that we wish we could change. I have witnessed Danny with Gretchen and Isabella and he couldn\u0027t have been a better husband, friend and father. If any of you actually know Danny, then watching this show will make you laugh, cry and feel for the entire Bonaduce family as they try to cope with Danny and his actions. We live in the USA and that means we ALL can make choices. If you don\u0027t like Danny, don\u0027t watch the show. If you do like Danny or at least need to watch the train wreck, watch and tell everyone you know to watch. I applaud Gretchen and Danny for being this BOLD in letting us into their personal world." }
