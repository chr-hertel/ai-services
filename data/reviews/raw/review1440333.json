It\u0027s an incredible journey through the facts that the US mainstream media hides, the lies, and the twisted truths they broadcast to affect the American public\u0027s opinion. Anybody in his right mind can spot this vast difference when they compare reports from CNN to that of BBC\u0027s (on the same story). Everything said in the movie is backed up by solid evidence and proof that won\u0027t leave you doubting. What I really liked about Peace, Propaganda, and The Promised Land is that it was Jews (even Rabbis), and Israelis who were \u0027telling the story\u0027, so to speak. In the end, the movie doesn\u0027t force anything down your throat, it just shows you what\u0027s really keeping the peace process from happening.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
