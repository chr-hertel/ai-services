I learned that most of the reviewers bashing it have only seen a few (at most) episodes from the first season - many haven\u0027t seen it at all, and are simply bashing it because of an overwhelming sense of pride in the original. I\u0027d be surprised if this review isn\u0027t skimmed over and marked unhelpful by them. Obviously I\u0027m not speaking to all the British, but the majority that unfairly judge this show with little to no basis in the truth. \n\nThis whole fanaticism is juvenile and petty. The casts of the US and UK versions love each show. Ricky Gervais even wrote and executive produced a few episodes of the US version. Open your minds, people! Most of the US fans KNOW that it\u0027s based on a British version. It has gotten the credit it deserves for being a brilliant and hilarious show. \n\nBut the American version is also brilliant and hilarious. I\u0027ve read comments ranging from \u0027bad acting\u0027 to \u0027direct copy\u0027, neither of which are true. The first season may have had its borrowed bits, but that was to get it on its feet. The second and third seasons have proved that it is a show entirely on its own, with scenarios and characters having NOTHING to do with the UK version at all. The acting is just as convincing and real as the UK version. \n\nI\u0027ve even read that Michael Scott is devoid of David Brent\u0027s humanity! In actuality, Michael Scott is shown as far more human than David Brent, who was more manipulative (albeit, poorly) and heartless. The US version still has the cruel elements of the UK version, but it balances these awkward, painful moments with tender, human moments, which makes it more enjoyable and watchable. \n\nAs for the humor, each show has its own moments of subtlety, detail, absolutely outrageous moments, awkwardness, pain, cuteness, ridiculousness, and vulgarity. The UK version was groundbreaking. But instead of blindly basing your opinions on bias and arrogance, see the US version for what it is - a brilliant, brighter version that, in its first season, simply used the framework of the original (the characters and basic situations) to get started with. \n\nThis is the funniest, smartest American television show in recent history besides Arrested Development. Not since Seinfeld has a show made me laugh so hard and smile so much. These three shows get better with each viewing and are great because there\u0027s so many levels of humor, from the apparent outrageousness to the minute details that are noticed after repeated viewings and are often funnier than the surface material.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
