Essentially a composite remake of \"Dracula\" and an earlier film called \"London After Midnight\" with some bizarre twists, in terms of ghoulish settings and atmosphere, particularly the cemetery scenes, and Lugosi and Borland wandering in the night, this film is second to none. There is no doubt that Bela Lugosi was the classic Dracula of the early sound period. If I were to make a list of his best 10 films, this would be one of them along with the 1931 \"Dracula\", the 1943 \"Return of the Vampire\", the 1940 \"The Devil Bat\" and others. Carol Borland\u0027s role as \"Luna\"sets the standard for \"Vampira\" of the 1950s and \"Elvira\" of the 1980s as well as \"Morticia\" of the Addams Family on TV. She does an excellent job in the role of a \"creature of the night\". And of course, Bela Lugosi as Count Mora is without peer. The entire cast including Lionel Barrymore, Lionel Atwill, Elizabeth Allen, Jean Hersholt, and others do an excellent job.\n\n10/10.\n\nDan Basinger" }
