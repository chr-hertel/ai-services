I love the photography, light and colors used along the scenes. It\u0027s a very good work that catches the eyes, really.\n\nStory is very interesting although quite boring in some parts. But it\u0027s not a problem at all. You\u0027ll enjoy it a lot if you like historic movies.\n\nThe play of the actors is impressive. Kate Blanchet is perfect in this movie.\n\nI saw this movie before I knew it is a sequel of the another movie, Elizabeth, and I\u0027m looking forward to watch this other one too.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
