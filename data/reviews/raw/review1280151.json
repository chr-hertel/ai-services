On New Years Eve 1999, Arthur is forced to experience his future and see what the consequences will be like if he does not have children now. He meets his son, Ako who reveals the situation and what he must do. Transported to the year 2070 we expect to find the typical mise-en-scène for a sci-fi film, however, to our great surprise it appears that human life has taken several steps backward and Paris is now completely \u0027ensablé\u0027 - covered sand. There is no time-capsule either; a simple loft-hatch is the portal to a very different Paris. Images of Hausmann style rooftops just sticking above ground level and the Eiffel Tower behind sand dunes is very thought provoking. The costumes are more medieval than 21st century. Thus this film not deals with the issues of relationships and the fate of individuals it gives a shocking reminder of the possible effects of man\u0027s mishandling of the environment. It also makes us think of the personal decisions we make and how that can affect the lives of others. In terms of cinematography this film is also impressive with the use of various camera angles and shots and the special effects necessary to create such surreal scenes.\n\nThe beginning of the film is well contrived to trick the viewer for a few moments. Nevertheless, the plot remains quite uneventful after the first ten minutes and the ending is very predictable. The film tries to show too many scenes and characters and does not allow the main three characters to be developed fully. We struggle to see whether the film is mainly a thought-provoking sci-fi, comedy or romantic film. Apart from Arthur the degree to which he characters are not surprised by the events is absurd. Any romance between Arhur and Lucie is also marred by the interruptions of feeble sexual humour. The sound track in the film, however, is actually well constructed and employed to provide links between present and future times. The abrupt stops in music provide suspense for the viewer and the tracks are taken from both contemporary French and English language music. \n\nOverall you will be disappointed by this film if you were expecting more than a light drama but it is still reasonably entertaining and a very original piece of cinema." }
