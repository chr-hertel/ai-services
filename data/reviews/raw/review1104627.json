I couldn\u0027t have been more wrong.\n\nAs soon as the credits began to roll I turned to my girlfriend and said word for word, \"This is the WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life.\" I felt so ashamed of myself because I was the one that picked it out at the video store thinking that it would better than the other choice of Without A Paddle. If I had one chance to use a time machine and back in time to change something, this would be it. I would go back, put A Dirty Shame back on the shelf and grab another movie, ANY movie, but this one.\n\nThe plot is absolutely horrendous, the acting is absolutely appalling, and the ending/message of the movie is absolutely ridiculous. I honestly don\u0027t see how others can review this movie with 10 stars unless they were severely hit in the head with a bowling ball.\n\nPLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOOD COMEDY, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
