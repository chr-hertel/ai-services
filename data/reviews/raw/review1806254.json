The acting in this film is sensational!! Execution of a crime is so often times motivated by egocentric behavior. The film \"Taking of Pelham One Two Three\" exemplifies that dubious characteristic of egomania to this felonious escapade with an utterly remarkable flair!! Capital crimes, and misdemeanors, are ubiquitous in New York, so when a group of intellectual villains get innovative with the societal nemesis of extortion through bodily harm, it throws the whole metropolitan area into a tailspin!! Politicians, including Mayor Koch, major companies, as well as banks, are put on front street in this film, and suddenly, this precarious cry for attention gets national notoriety!! Made right around the time of New York City facing massive default, in conjunction with seeking a huge Federal bailout from the Ford Administration, this movie articulated the myriad of dilemmas that affected Manhattan\u0027s ephemeral functionality!! Anybody who perceived the New York City subway system to be an archaic carnival ride, may have had a healthy dose of vindication served to them when considering what happened!! Their assessment of this mode of cosmopolitan transportation, probably frightened them, especially if they were to be on the Pelham line during this particular fiasco!! By attrition, all of the belligerent reprobates who orchestrated this depraved debacle, wound up being their own undoing while in the process of terrorizing New York City .. It was mere conjecture as to whether or not the law enforcement units of New York would capitulate to such blatant blackmail.. As it turned out, this was a crap shoot that these academic hoodlums won!! So many details related to this crime were convincingly earmarked in their favor, so what went wrong? I\u0027ll tell you what went wrong: Of all the days to catch a cold!! This movie dealt with garnering an emerging empathy with the malaise movie-viewer to allow many different walks of life to assert themselves!! Movies and television have always had a knack for glamorizing heinous crimes!! So many criminals have incredibly brilliant minds!! Many hypothetical theories manufacture the distorted contention that \"If these criminals used their minds to do something constructive, they would be able to make as much, if not more money, legitimately, than they do by stealing it!!\" Unfortuneatly, I have just this analogy to counter that statement with: \"All the change that I have found under the cushions of the living room sofa have amounted to enough money to be able to pay off the mortgage\" Basically, this is just an exaggerated figure of speech!! The \u00272009 version of this film has intrigued me, I am very interested in finding out how good it is!! The original 1974 movie is so creative!! One little detail which employs deductive reasoning winds up solving this entire case!!! It becomes a proverbial instance of three strikes and you\u0027re out!! Such a scenario makes these visceral components to this sordid incident, the outlaw\u0027s ultimate Achilles heal!! This movie keeps you interested from start to finish, not too many movies are capable of doing that!! The acting, the directing, and the fast paced cinematography of New York City in this film were all fantastic!! I give this film five stars... It is on my top 50 list!!! Definitely!!!! See the new one if you want to, however, without question, it goes without saying that you should see the 1974 version first!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
