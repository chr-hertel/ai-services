But actually Bogart\u0027s performance is one of the best ingredients in this campy flick. Bogart\u0027s two really terrible acting attempts were the same year in \"The Oklahoma Kid,\" where he tried to play dastardly villain, Whip McCord, and \"Dark Victory,\" where Bogart is completely miscast as an Irish horse trainer.\n\nNineteen thirty nine must have been Bogart\u0027s quirky year. He finally found himself in the early 1940\u0027s and with \"The Maltese Falcon\" became a screen icon. In \"The Return of Doctor X,\" with his chalky makeup and streaked hair, Bogart resembles a punk rocker before his time.\n\nThe film is not bad entertainment. The weakest part is the attempt by Wayne Morris to be funny. He thinks falling into a room by leaning against a supposedly locked door which suddenly opens is hilarious. So much so that he does it twice. The funniest character is Huntz Hall early in his career. There is one funny line from Morris. After digging up Quesne\u0027s body and in a hurry to leave, morris tells the caretaker to \"put it back,\" then rushes off.\n\nThe acting is top notch with the best performance coming from John Litel, closely matched by Bogart\u0027s left-field mad dead doctor. All in all a curious and worthwhile film, especially for Bogart fans.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
