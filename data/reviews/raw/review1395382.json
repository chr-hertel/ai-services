It is amazing how they built the fort and Indian village by hand, in the manner in which they were originally built, just 10 miles away from the original location of Jamestown, in Virginia. If you like history and romance, you will probably dig it. If you fell asleep in school, you may find it boring. If you are interested in America\u0027s original inhabitants, you may find it intellectually stimulating. If you think Colin Farrell looks absolutely cool when he smiles shyly, instead of being the tough guy all of the time, you will enjoy watching him. If you enjoy the lyrical cinematography of Terrence Mallick, you will be all over it. That is what I think.\n\nTa, Sheshetta", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
