When a reclusive man invites five of the world\u0027s most famous detectives fro the weekend, with the promise of dinner and a murder, who can refuse? To start things off there is a blind butler, played by Sir Alec Guinness and the deaf cook played by Nancy Walker. Add to the mix Truman Capote as the diabolical and sometimes maniacal Lionel Twain. For good measure add David Niven and Maggie Smith as Dick and Dora Charleston, James Coco as Milo Perrier and James Cromwell as his chauffeur, Peter Sellers at his finest as Inspector Sidney Wang with Ricard Narita as his son Willie, Elsa Lanchester as Miss Jane Marbles, with Estelle Winwood as her nurse, Miss Withers, and finally Peter Falk as Sam Diamond and Eileen Brennan as his secretary. Whats not to like. The dialog is witty and fast paced, the setting is delightful and the comedy is over the top. All in all a delightful romp.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
