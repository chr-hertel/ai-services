Planes! Jackson! Awesome!", "reviewBody": "Do you like snakes? Do you like Airplanes? Do you like Snakes on Airplanes??? Do you like Samuel L. Jackson? Does the idea of Samuel L. Jackson fighting killer snakes inside of a flying airplane sound Awesome to you. If so Don\u0027t miss Snakes on a Plane. This was definitely the most ridiculous movie i have ever seen and yet it kept me entertained due to its level of unrealistic nonsense well-done. Just when you think the movie can not possibly get any funnier....BAM more snakes on the plane and these snakes are angry. They eat anything in there way including both male and female no no special spot places. check this movie out. :}", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
