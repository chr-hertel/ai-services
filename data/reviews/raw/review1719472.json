Not knowing what to expect I began to watch it, and by the end of the program I was unable to move from my chair.\n\nI find it so powerful, and am constantly speaking about it to my friends. I even now watch the \u0027repeat\u0027 program so as not to miss anything which I may not have caught the first time. In other words, I am addicted to \u0027Starting Over.\u0027 I think both coaches do an amazing job and they can be so compassionate. Although I feel that sometimes they tend to be somewhat harsh, the girls seem to understand that this is part of the process of healing and accept it.\n\nI would really like to know what happened to the participants after leaving the \u0027Starting Over House\u0027 as I feel as I know each one of them personally. I would love to hear how they have progressed in life.\n\nI feel that I must thank everyone involved in this magnificent program which is somehow even changing my life, and ways of looking at things, just by watching it in my sitting room.\n\nMy best wishes to everyone involved, and may happiness be yours forever.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
