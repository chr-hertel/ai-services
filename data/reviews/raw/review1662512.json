I honestly wasn\u0027t sure what to expect going into this movie, but I was hoping that all the questions would be answered.\n\nIn all honesty, the movie\u0027s biggest fault is the fact that it is almost three hours long. I found myself sitting there bored waiting for the movie to end because things just continued to go on and on. The acting was probably the highlight of the film. Again, solid performances by Depp and Rush and they really carry the movie to the end. I was disappointed with the fact that I felt Orlando Bloom did not seem to have a big part in the film except at the end.\n\nAll in all, I felt the laughs in the movie were suitable for 12 year olds and the plot had too much of a sci-fi twist. And I found myself very confused throughout the entire film, despite having some pretty entertaining action sequences. At the end of the movie, I felt that they left it open to make a fourth movie (which they have pretty much agreed to do) where they create more questions than those that got answered.\n\nThe bottom line is if you are a fan of the series, check the movie out, but I think unless you are a die-hard fan, you will be quite disappointed. Lets hope that part four will be better (and shorter) than this mishmash of a movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
