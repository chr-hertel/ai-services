Didn\u0027t love, but enjoyed it. This, however, is right up there with Alexander, at times bordering on ridiculous camp. Some of the battle scenes go on and on and I find myself wondering why I am supposed to be invested. Orlando Bloom? Moviestar he ain\u0027t. Really. Please. Enough of this waif. A movie like this needs Russell Crowe (the best male lead working today). It\u0027s an ambitious quest story and needs an actor of mythical proportions, or at least a very self serious one. Eva Green is pretty, the rest of the cast a waste of screen time even though I enjoyed Jeremy Irons part. Some actors are so great they can even conjure a great part out of nothing. Rent this movie or wait for it to run on TV over and over again.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
