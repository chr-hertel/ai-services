With the exception of my cousins whom with the tape was regularly shared!!\n\nStill now my cousins \u0026 I quote lines from it - \n\nEspecially the \"Great great great great...... Grandmother!\" one.\n\nI am trying to get a copy to show my niece of 2yrs..... \n\nI\u0027m sure she will be hooked!! \n\nSo no matter how tough life gets - there will always be a smile when i think of \"The Bunny Picnic\"", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
