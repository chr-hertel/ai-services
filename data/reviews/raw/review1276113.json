There is a bathroom scene where Big Momma has to sit on a toilet and do # 2 while another actor is hiding in the shower behind a curtain and how quickly the actor has to poke his head out the bathroom Window for AIR. Nia Long, (Sherry Pierce) was very attractive and showed her body parts off perfectly according to Martin Lawrence, (Malcolm Turner) big round eyes. Every actor in this film gave a great supporting role and I look forward to seeing BIG MOMMA\u0027S HOUSE # 2 when it hits the BIG SCREEN. If you missed this first picture, I know you will want to watch #2.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
