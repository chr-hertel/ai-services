Its unusual to find such a philosophical film that keeps both your eyes and heart wide awake.\n\nThe truly altruistic nature of love, the crazy things it makes you do and not regret are born out in this film in beautiful ways. From an Iranian perspective it is an interesting look at cross-cultural phenomena but I think the average American doesn\u0027t know enough about Afghani, Kurdish and Iranian culture to appreciate that.\n\nYou see this coming from the start but I\u0027ll warn you that the next thing I say might spoil part of the film for you:\n\nMy favorite scene is at the end when she drops her burka as she realizes he loves her, realizing how dangerous her beauty is, how it has left this poor boy in emotional and financial chaos and how she cannot do anything to help.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
