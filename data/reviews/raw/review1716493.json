This film was neither.\n\nHigh School Musical 2 was bad piece of work. The sequel to a brilliant first film is a story already told in that first film. Creativity swept into a black whole. Or under the viewer\u0027s rug. The movie appeared to begin with a plot but the storytellers wandered away from it. Attention to the story was sacrificed to fit in an extra song or two. An extra hat.\n\nThe soundtrack did not match the heat level reached and set in the original film. The song-writing was good. The singers fine. Upbeat. Performing with passion. But the bond between a song and a scene -the one that makes music memorable- is missing. The choreographed dancing was as brilliant as in the first film. Lot\u0027s of energy. Lot\u0027s of talent with the cast and crew in that area. For what they had to work with, the acting was fine. Simply no fireworks.\n\nThe musical mixing near the film\u0027s end was shameful. A mess. And then the story was over. On a stage. And then it wasn\u0027t. A horrible idea to add a bad second ending.\n\nHigh School Musical 1 was collectible. High School Musical 2 was forgettable.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
