And the answer will be yes. You just have to let go and enjoy--by whatever means you prefer.\n\nPineapple Express is another Seth Rogan crazy adventure a couple of guys go through, bonding along the way. This time James Franco makes the movie as a lovable burn out, not the typical role you\u0027d expect from Green Goblin Jr. \n\nIf marijuana turns you off then forget it, you\u0027ll hate the movie, But if you can chill out for two hours and laugh at the movie\u0027s action, stoner-antics, and borderline romantic male bonding then you\u0027ll get your ten dollars worth.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
