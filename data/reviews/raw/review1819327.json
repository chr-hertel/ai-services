However, it\u0027s a welcome direction for the series and it shows the cast\u0027s talent.\n\nThere are some particularly dramatic moments in this tale and the normally restrained Gareth David-Lloyd is splendid as a guilt wrapped, borderline-psychotic Ianto. It\u0027s taken me a while to warm to Ianto but there\u0027s more to him than meets the eye.\n\nUnmissable British science fiction on a shoe-string. 9 out of 10. This series of \"Torchwood\" is proving to be a great improvement on the (still entertaining) original.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
