The eldest is showing signs of mental strain. He walks around Central Park smoking cigarettes. The middle brother is married to a free-spirit European nymph who flirts with both the oldest and youngest brothers (the youngest is a horny photographer). The oldest brother develops an abnormal attachment to the girl, and that\u0027s when the breakdown begins.\n\nEven as mid-sixties adult films go, \"Sin Magazine\" offers little nudity (most of it photographs of photographs). The acting is adequate, but who cares? There\u0027s an eight-minute Point-of-view shot where the middle brother seduces a female magazine distributor who works out of a closet. Only for Al Mitchel aficionados.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
