Everyone played their characters extremely well, you couldn\u0027t ask for more. The set and costumes were also amazing, i just love everything about this film. Zac Efron is especially hot and is the perfect choice for Link. I love the old one but i have to say that this is miles better. I found myself just smiling all the way through it and i couldn\u0027t stop, i just wanted to get up and dance, even my boyfriend loved it and he wants to go again (which we will be doing.) Very enjoyable and worth seeing! Best movie all year!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
