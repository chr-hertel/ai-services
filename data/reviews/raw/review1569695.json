Thank you for all the good reviews here, that\u0027s why I bought this one. I have no idea how somebody on IMDb could like this...., do you people don\u0027t love \"movies\"? It\u0027s trash, not good, not good, I repeat: not good! It\u0027s boring, not funny, not scary or thrilling or gory. The actors try to do something with the stuff the script and the director is telling them - they had no chance, ever! Just a bad boring story told by an untalented director (Have you seen CREEP??, okay...)he has no talent, is not sophisticated and so on, so: please don\u0027t rent or buy this one - it\u0027s a waste compared to SHAUN OF THE DEAD for example or HAUTE TENSION, stay away, stay away. It is garbage!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
