But there are different ways in which many people perceive humour, some believe it\u0027s all about the jokes, some enjoy the swearing involved and others might love the typical Woody Allen script.\n\nThis movie isn\u0027t set to achieve an Oscar or any kind of prestigious award. I am pretty sure that that was the last thing that came through the writer\u0027s and director\u0027s minds. The only thing they intended to do was to make a film that could be enjoyed by the audience that loves the stereo-typing comedy films, which to be honest is growing faster and faster. And they nailed it.\n\nThe story is hilarious, the acting, well method and redman are hilarious at what they do best, which is fool around. Don\u0027t expect any intelligent sophisticated humour or satire. I\u0027m not implying that the movie is full of dumb humour, on the contrary, its loaded with brilliant funny situations and loads of jokes. If you liked soul plane, then you\u0027re going to love this one.\n\nSo don\u0027t vote negatively just because it wasn\u0027t your cup of tea and try to understand that there\u0027s a different generation out there that really appreciates a good fun entertaining movie to watch as they also appreciate the other styles of \"comedy\".", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
