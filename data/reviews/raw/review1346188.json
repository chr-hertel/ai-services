Funniest thing I\u0027ve seen in years", "reviewBody": "Previously I had thought that the highpoint of Bobcat Goldthwait\u0027s career was going to be Hot to Trot. Boy was I wrong. This is the funniest thing I\u0027ve seen on TV for as far back as I can remember. I\u0027m still laughing about it while I\u0027m writing this. I was crying and punching my pillow and wishing someone else was watching it with me besides my dog at 4 in the morning. Now I don\u0027t want to build it up because then you might be let down. I know how people can say, this was SOOO funny then you go see it and you\u0027re like, it wasn\u0027t that funny. So...this wasn\u0027t that funny. But let\u0027s just say it was good enough to make me instantly look it up afterwards and get a membership on IMDb in order to leave a comment about how amazing it was. If anyone ever reads this...My God. This show. I can\u0027t believe it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
