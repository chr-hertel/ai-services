Luckily this film is far better than they crawl. I guess that my expectations were rather low going into this film (which always helps) but I did like this film. It was a bit strange that I happened to watch this film straight after watching cold creek manor as certain plot stories are almost identical, but I am sure that they nest wasn\u0027t the first to come up with this it certainly preceded cold creek manor. Only thing to say is...If cockroaches and/or bugs make you feel errgh don\u0027t watch, otherwise not a bad little horror film there are much worse ways to kill an hour and a half.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
