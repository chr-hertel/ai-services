I will just throw my 2 cents in. This movie was very dark, with little comic relief. After the disappointment of the first movie, along with the lack of real appeal from Episode 2, George had to really come up with something special to make 3 magic. And he succeeded. Very enjoyable, tons of fun, a very dark movie that is worth the time. Definitely one to see in the theatre, the effects will blow you away (even in this digitally overloaded era). The sound is amazing, and the story and acting were very well done.\n\nIf you are looking for a deep, existential movie then go see Batman Begins, if you are looking for a dark, Star Wars action movie, see this one, over and over again.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
