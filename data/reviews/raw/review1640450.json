Though I thought the acting was exceptional, especially Ryan Gosling, the story itself and the characters was something I couldn\u0027t get into.\n\nVery simply, Ryan Gosling is an inner city junior high school teacher who looks very much like the kind that I would have liked to have had more of back in the day. He\u0027s a bright, witty guy who really does relate to his students even though he\u0027s white and they\u0027re mostly black.\n\nOne of them discovers he\u0027s got a drug habit, Gosling scores from one of the local dealers in her neighborhood. As you can imagine things just aren\u0027t the same after that.\n\nThough his performance is exceptional and maybe even deserving of the Oscar nomination for Best Actor he got, I just could not get up any sympathy over him. He\u0027s upset over the state of things in the good old USA, well too bad, a lot of us are, very few of us turn to drugs as are chosen method of protest.\n\nIn the end I could not figure out what the point of Half Nelson was. Fans of Ryan Gosling will probably like it though.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
