Its cheeky veneer winks its message to you, that things are rarely what they seem to be on the surface. In a large context this is a movie about a child on the brink of adulthood learning to see her parents as the flawed human beings they really are Â– and from that awareness, understanding herself more clearly and growing from the experience. Eckelberry develops the metaphor of the \"mirror\" as a device that reflects truth (or, as the ancients feared, the window to the soul) really creatively. The set design is amazing, and the performances by the entire cast are charming and fun. A great time. See it!" }
