He played Poirot in three theatrical films: Death On the Nile, Evil Under the Sun, and Appointment With Death. He also played Poirot in three TV movies: Thirteen At Dinner, Murder in Three Acts, and Dead Man\u0027s Folly. It\u0027s always a delight to spend time with Ustinov\u0027s Poirot. He\u0027s so much fun! The three Poirot TV movies starring Ustinov are now available in a three DVD set. I\u0027ve had a great time watching these with friends and family and all of Ustinov\u0027s Poirot movies are worth watching and re-watching. My deep affection for Ustinov\u0027s Poirot grows with each viewing. He\u0027s brilliant and each of his Poirot movies are fantastic fun.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
