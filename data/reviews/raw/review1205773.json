It includes interviews with notable people associated with the shorts as well as showing clips from the actual films alongside the cartoon that parodied it. I found it all very interesting, if a bit on the long side. The clips from the shorts are as great as always and there\u0027s a pretty good chance that every Looney Tunes fan will enjoy. Overall I didn\u0027t find it as great as say \"Behind the Tunes - Crash! Bang! Boom!: The Wild Sounds of Treg Brown\" though.\n\nMy Grade: A-", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
