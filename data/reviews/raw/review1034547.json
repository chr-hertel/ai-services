I\u0027m so glad I watched it. It shows you the power of love can overcome everything. I\u0027ve never heard of this story, but now that I saw the movie, I\u0027m going to go buy the book. It\u0027s a really good movie. I hope everyone had a chance to see it!! The actors were excellent in it. It was very real and very sweet. Everything about it was great. Halle Berry gave an excellent performance as Janie. She was very good in this and I think she re-transformed herself by doing this movie. It made me see her in a new light. She\u0027s a talented actress. I hope everyone agrees with me that this was a very well put together movie. I hope I get a chance to see it again in the future. I wouldn\u0027t say it\u0027s a family movie, but the story behind it is something everyone should share with their kids. The story behind it is LOVE! Everyone we know gives love and they need to share this story of love with their kids. No matter where you come from there is someone out there in the world for you.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
