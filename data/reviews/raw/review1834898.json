This Preston Sturges message film is certainly better than the above movies but in the end I was still somewhat letdown. I\u0027m not sure what it is but Sturges is hitting me as a light version of Frank Capra but there\u0027s still plenty to enjoy in this film and I think I\u0027ll enjoy it even more after a second viewing. The best thing the film has going for it is the two leads who do very good work. McCrea is always good but Veronica Lake really steals the show with her beauty and attitude. The message of the film is certainly very strong but the film just seemed overly light to me." }
