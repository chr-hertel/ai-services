With all the over the top comedy through-out the movie, it\u0027s easy to miss Chevy with Ted Knight and Rodney Dangerfield\u0027s over the top performances. Chevy clearly has some of the best lines, delivered so off-the-cuff as to be easily missed.\n\nBill Murray may be at his comedic best in this movie playing underplaying an over-the-top character with great effect. He\u0027s so funny, it\u0027s easy to spend your time watching this movie in eager anticipation of when he\u0027ll again be on screen.\n\nRodney Dangerfield is classic Rodney Dangerfield in a part that had to be written just for him. Much of his schtick is just as tired as Rodney looks, but all is delivered with his usual \"I\u0027ve got a squirrel in my pants\" style. If you\u0027re a fan of Rodney, there\u0027s lots to like about him in the movie. If you hate him, though, be warned: his screen time will wear on you like nails on a chalkboard.\n\nTed Knight in a pseudo-Ted Baxter performance fits his role perfectly. If you grew up watching him on the Mary Tyler Moore show, you\u0027ll get more of the same.\n\nMichael O\u0027Keefe and Tony D\u0027Annunzio play good counterpoints to each other in underdeveloped, but clich√©d roles of \"average nice guy\" and \"hip, cool guy\" to Cindy Morgan\u0027s smokin\u0027 hot chick. (She is gorgeous!) Sarah Holcomb\u0027s Irish looks and accent are a joy. Too bad this was her last film.\n\nPlenty of great characters with at least six or more mixed up plot lines held loosely together by the golfing theme and intersecting liberally. The setting automatically excuses most of the dating of the movie. Hey, everyone knows golfers have no fashion sense.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
