Worst than watching all the Most Awesomely Bad series all together. What\u0027s so bad about this show is that Rachel Perry narrates it. Even worse you hear the same old stupid issues every time you watch the show. Ever see this show playing change the channel. The I Love the... series is extremely superior to this piece of garbage. The only people who would enjoy this show are fans of Paris Hilton and every other utterly overrated celebrity as this is utterly overrated. One more say about this show. \u0027\u0027VH1: All Access sucks!!!\u0027\u0027\u0027. Any question about this dreadful series.
