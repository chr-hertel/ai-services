While The Beginning tries to inject the feeling that we are watching the birth of Leatherface\u0027s depravity (and while indeed we do see the actual birth. Note: Don\u0027t sit too long in the popcorn stand line or you\u0027ll miss it) it feels that we actually are missing the entire point to it. Yes he was adopted by quite an evil family. And yes it is hinted at a life he lived on the outside,taunted by others and maiming animals. But the film never delivers these scenes and bypasses them completely to Leatherface\u0027s first chainsaw free kill. The actual back story seems more wasted upon his uncle the sheriff. A job he receives by default in their newly dead town.\n\nAs soon as the four protagonists of the film hit the screen- two couples on their way to drop the men off to army boot camp for Vietnam- the beginning only retreads the Remakes territory and nothing groundbreaking comes from it. Although there is some good gore.\n\nWe do find out why characters in the remake are missing they\u0027re teeth or limbs, but nothing defining. And we are spoon fed similar scenes from the remake including a chase sequence at the slaughterhouse albeit not quite as effective this time around. Blame a weak script. Because the cast is game and willing. Jordana Brewster is a wonderful heroine and the scene where she is about to escape the house but is drawn back in shows that director Johnathan Lieberman can helm the mayhem.\n\nBut the mayhem here seems a bit tame. There are few if any actual scares although the tension is ripe. The atmosphere is right. The scene where Jordana leaves a brutal chainsaw event and is emotionally and physically lost is spot on. But then the film gets hampered down by a feeling that we\u0027ve seen it already. \n\nThe infamous dinner scene gets recreated but it actually isn\u0027t effective at all. The chainsaw kills are basically one and the same with each victim. And the big downer is that we never feel like we understand why Leatherface dons the mask or becomes the killer. What they add instead is a biker subplot that is uneven and stupid. And the end is actually terrible and inconceivable. I wished I\u0027d loved it. I hope you do.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
