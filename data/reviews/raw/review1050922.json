Miles of film is expended detailing the boys at Mission Control and Kennedy trying to implement the \"unless\" I mentioned, a bold rescue mission that will arrive in the last moments of their O2, lifting off into the teeth of a hurricane, no less.\n\nWhat makes the movie work are the very things that were lampooned so accurately by the boys at Mystery Science Theatre 3000, the terse acronym-filled jargon, the performances by Peck, Janssen, Crenna, Hackman, and Franciscus, and the glaringly non-CGI special effects (that looked great in 1970).\n\nFor a space-happy 11 year old, this was the ne plus ultra of movies--and the fact that the boys on the Apollo 13 had recently gotten back alive made Marooned more than a leetle beet unnerving in its topicality.\n\nThere\u0027s a moment that the movie transcends a clinical yawner, and takes on the mantle of heartbreakingly human drama. When the astronauts\u0027 wives are brought in to talk to them on small TV monitors, one after the other, and Nancy Kovack coldly tells the NASA suit \"I know why we\u0027re here--we\u0027re here to say goodbye to them,\" you feel sucker-punched. It didn\u0027t seem real until right then.\n\nThen the wives are warned that their husbands are \"degraded,\" meaning they\u0027re tired, cold, and scared beyond description. Richard Crenna and Lee Grant have a touching exchange, the commander and his tough, beautiful, middle-aged wife trying to say everything to each other except goodbye. Kovack struggles with James Franciscus because her husband is the Spock of this mission, clinical and scientific. Yet he angrily assures her that they will make it. You can see him expending every bit of energy to convince her and himself that he\u0027s not a dead man orbiting.\n\nFinally, Mariette Hartley tries to comfort Gene Hackman, who is bordering on hysteria and panic. She watches in a gut-wrenching horror as he reacts to her reading a letter the wives have written to the President. He cries and rages something like \"I broke the lawn-mower, and I can\u0027t fix it and everyone is blaming me for it!\" Hartley is hustled away, but she stops in dumb horror as she sees her husband on the big monitor in flight control, screaming \"Don\u0027t kill me!\" as Crenna and Franciscus hold him down to shoot him full of sedatives.\n\nIt\u0027s the most painful and human moment of the movie. Sturges has kept you on the edge of boredom, then wham, it\u0027s somehow all real. The movie goes from intellect to emotion in a matter of a few moments. I didn\u0027t appreciate this as an a tweenager, but God how my mouth went dry watching it a few days ago. These poor bastards are already in their titanium-shielded coffin! \n\nThe rest of the movie is predictable, but brutal in its denouement. You know that, if the men are to be saved, there\u0027s going to be some dues paid. I remember seeing Marooned at the Garland Theatre in Spokane in May, 1970. When those dues were paid, my mom was tearing up. \n\nI thought, typical for a woman.\n\nI was clearing my throat a lot and having trouble focusing on the screen when my family and I watched it over the weekend.\n\nAdulthood has its upside, I guess." }
