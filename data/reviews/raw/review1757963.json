A part of the movie at the end when Cameron get out from the back of the car to save Ewan from the death had retained my attention. In the background, there is a music playing i\u0027m looking for, it sounds like Techno or Dance and i\u0027 like to know who\u0027s playing as it seems not to be part of the soundtrack. Does Anyone know the name of that music ? It would be so nice to forward it to me. I reviewed lot of comments about this soundtrack and never found what i was searching here.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
