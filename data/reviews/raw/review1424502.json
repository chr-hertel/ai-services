T3 lives up to the reputation of the previous movies with more special effects and action sequences than before.10 years have passed since John Connor (Stahl) helped to blow up Cyberdyne Systems and stop judgment day now 23 years old he lives a quiet existence, no credit cards, phone, address or home. He is trying to escape the future and his destiny meanwhile a new terminator called the T-X (Loken) has been sent to eliminate his lieutenants including Kate Brewster (Danes) who will be an important part of the resistance and later become John\u0027s wife. But another terminator called the T-850 (Schwarzenegger) has also arrived to protect both John \u0026 Kate and ensure their survival. However the terminator informs him that judgment day wasn\u0027t stopped and the inevitable will happen , the T-X is also after Kate\u0027s father Robert Brewster(Andrews) the original creator of Skynet that\u0027s the virus that\u0027s infected everything from computers to satellites and when the machines take control chaos follows. Nick Stahl\u0027s performance as John Connor was both electrifying and good. Linda Hamilton\u0027s replacement Claire Danes delivered a stunning and fearless performance as a future warrior 9/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
