Kidman spends the first half of the movie squeaking hysterically and the second half being the passive observer of her own fate; McGregor is styled as if he was a member of the Backstreet Boys.\n\nbut there are so many other things that bothered me. the comedy parts are so over the top that they are more annoying than funny. the voice-over narration is just lazy. and i know in a movie like this the story is not really important, but still, it wouldn\u0027t have hurt to have a slightly less idiotic plot.\n\nthe selection of songs is a mixed bag: Patti Labelles \"lady marmalade\" and the polices \"Roxanne\" are a given, and there are flashes of brilliance (eg. Nirvanas \"smells like teen spirit\", Madonnas \"material girl\"). but \"the sound of music\" and \"rhythm of the night\"? \"up where we belong\"? really? and for a film that relies so heavily on its production design, Moulin Rouge! is remarkably tasteless, even for a film that embraces kitsch. (check out Sofia Coppolas \"Marie Antoinette\", Fran√ßois Ozons \"8 Femmes\" or Todd Haynes\u0027 \"velvet goldmine\" to see how these things should be done.)\n\nif seen with lesser expectations, Moulin Rouge! is still an enjoyable rush with an admirable artistic vision buried somewhere underneath its many flaws. its certainly courageous and unique, and it will probably be even more hilarious to see it in ten or twenty years. but really, i don\u0027t understand why it was so successful.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
