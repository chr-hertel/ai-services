Very, very bad.", "reviewBody": "This is a very, very bad movie. It simply uninteresting to watch. Satisfactory film - this is a movie from which you can at least have fun. The bad movie - it is a movie that you can see and understand that it is bad. A terrible movie - a film that even impossible to watch. So Babel places is a the harrowing film that it is simply impossible to watch. But not all bad, places emphasis able to absorb spectators. That is why I did not put him 4 assessment that, in my understanding means \"terrible movie,\" and evaluate 5, which means \"bad movie\". By the way: pornographic and erotic scenes here are not absolutely needed. Also, as not to the point and Brad Pitt. But this is my subjective opinion.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
