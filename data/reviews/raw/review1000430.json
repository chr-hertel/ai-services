  "reviewBody": "I went with a certain amount of trepidation, but I came out of this movie impressed with the way the story was told. Jennifer Garner is gorgeous and the villains were wonderful. Elektra is an anti-hero (a person who kills people, not saves them; but soon chooses a better path), so expect a lot of violence and action. The refreshing thing is that there is real dialog and real depth also in this surprising film. I recommend this movie to anyone who has got an imagination, a taste in movies, an action movie lover or a Marvel fan. Bottom line - go see this because you will not be disappointed. It is a fun action movie with a good story.\n\nFinally, a movie that was worth the admission fee. This is an action fan\u0027s dream that will keep you on the edge of your seat, while delivering an actual plot. 5 stars, I know it\u0027s early but so far the best movie of 2005.",
