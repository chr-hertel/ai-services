Good old-fashioned story-telling with the drama of severe to the point of seemingly unsurmountable cultural conflict wrought out by strong acting from the relatively unknown leads. \n\nWhen Carola, a Swiss woman (as pale,willowy and Teutonic as they make them) vacationing with her boyfriend Stefan, is smitten at first sight with Lemalian, a Masai warrior, she decides to follow her heart. \n\nAs a viewer, one feels part of the scene, drawn into Carola\u0027s frame of mind, experiencing her alternate euphoric connection with Lemalian and the strain of coming to terms with a culture, and indeed, even a man, who, despite their love, is unlike what she is accustomed to.\n\n(A warning for the squeamish: there are several scenes of traditional Masai customs that, while not brutal, will at least make you cringe and avert.) \n\nThe film is based on an autobiographical book that was a huge bestseller in Europe. While I haven\u0027t read the book and cannot vouch for the film\u0027s accuracy, its realistic tone is never in doubt. There are no saccharine contrivances about the culture gap or simplistic portrayals or any other false notes.\n\nIn fact between the taut performances, sweeping cinematography of the Kenyan countryside, keenly observed detail of daily life and the pitch-perfect score, The White Masai almost has an epic feel to it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
