Yet, as is usually the case with the \u0027one-last-job\u0027 style crime movies, he is halted in the midst of this quiet exit by, you guessed it, one last job. The maelstrom that ensues is everything XXXX has worked to avoid over the course of his career.\n\nOur nameless narrator is everything that most people would least come to expect from a typical gangster. He is not loud, he is not avaricious, he sees the drug game as a business and nothing more, \"I\u0027m not a gangster. I\u0027m a businessman whose commodity happens to be cocaine.\" However the last job he takes sees him dealing with his polar-opposites, those who are in the business for, as he sees it, the wrong reasons. Their desires extend well beyond what anyone can consider cautious and they are involved \"to be a face, a name.\" As one might remember, Frank Lopez in Scarface had a word for these kind of people, \u0027chazzers.\u0027 Those who want more than they need. And, as one might remember, Tony Montana did not heed Lopez\u0027s advice and it ultimately led to his downfall. XXXX, however, does follow the drug-dealing codes. Yet, will he be able to keep his human flaws in check? And even if he does, will he still see his own downfall before he is able to leave the drug business? Layer Cake is the directorial debut of Matthew Vaughn (of Snatch and Lock, Stock fame). Based on the book by J.J. Connolly, it is a sleek, well-acted British gangster flick.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
