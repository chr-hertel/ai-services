In point of fact, the crime fighting cyborg was introduced with or before DC\u0027s original Robotman (created by Siegel and Schuster, who had earlier created Superman) in the Apr 1942 Star-Spangled Comics. The original Robotman, who had a human brain and an otherwise robotic body, appeared routinely until 1953. He was occasionally reprinted, and revived later. There were probably antecedents for Robotman in the American pulp magazines of the \u002730s or \u002740s. Certainly science fiction magazines, books, and comic books continued to feature such characters subsequently.\n\nEitoman might or might not have played some role in informing the creators of RoboCop; but it didn\u0027t present the innovation often claimed." }
