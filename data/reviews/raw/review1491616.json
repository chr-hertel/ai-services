Sentanced to death in a month. That brother being the only family you have left. Would you do everything to stop him from dying? Michael decided to do so. Its simply interesting to see, how a genius (in the word\u0027s original meaning) can manipulate everybody around him (and doing that with style). Not even every sci-fi series can compete with PB (prison break) in special effects and action.\n\nTo sum it up, PB is easily one of the best series out there. I recommend everyone to watch at least one episode. I can guarantee you, that if you watch the very first episode (Plot) you wont get enough, till you them all... happy watching...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
