One of the only series where I was really disappointed that it was cancelled. There was several seasons left of good material I\u0027m sure, I think it was a huge blunder that some exec cancelled it. Bring it back!\n\nGood action, good plot. Excellent characters and character growth throughout the episodes. This series featured an excellent atmosphere that is lacking in most series. There were so many plot developments that were unanswered when the show was cancelled, bring it back for a few more seasons. There\u0027s lots of good material here to keep watchers interested. \n\nWhy would a highly rated show get cancelled? Especially considering the crap that isn\u0027t cancelled." }
