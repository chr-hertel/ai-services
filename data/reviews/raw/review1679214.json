While the English do get constantly bombarded at the Malta Islands, they remain steadfastly determined to keep charging especially after King George VI pays a visit there...The most interesting part of this episode is the amount of mealtimes the British sailors have in a day: 5 (cocoa, breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper)! There\u0027s also scenes of relaxation on board ship before the, we later find out, 17 months of battle that occurs on the Malta shores. Once again, great narration and wonderfully stirring music as written by the legendary Richard Rodgers. Victory at Sea is essential viewing for the World War II scholar interested in seeing history come alive on television!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
