In retrospect, it was a rather surreal experience, with all these famous people wishing Donald Duck a happy birthday. I vaguely remember Donald stepping off an airplane onto the tarmac as part of the celebration.\n\nI even had it on tape - recorded by my dad on Beta from TV, with commercials included! I think it ran again on CBS once or twice after that, too. I loved to watch it.\n\nI didn\u0027t realize it was nominated for Emmys in the outstanding animated category. That seems a little strange, since it was probably almost as much live-action as animated. I guess this would have predated \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" among attempts to show animated characters and live action on the same frame. For example, I believe there were several occasions where Dick van Dyke was \u0027talking\u0027 to Donald Duck.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
