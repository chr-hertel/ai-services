I have seen bad movies (If anything because I didn\u0027t have to pay for them) \n\nThis...was not as bad as it could have been.\n\nNor was it on the Caliber of Wimmer\u0027s other directorial work (Hell, most of his writing work too). In a head-to-head contest I have no doubt that Equilibrium would dominate completely, with the recruit not far behind.\n\nYet I didn\u0027t walk out, and I\u0027d go see it again (preferably in the company of friends).\n\nIf you\u0027re not a particularly visual person you might find some of the cityscapes and futuristic devices overkilled (I counted gags stolen from Blade Runner and Milla\u0027s own Fifth Element among other things) And if you\u0027re looking for a deep thought-provoking film or one that leaves you asking \"...why?\" at the end this isn\u0027t the movie for you. Wait until Silent Hill comes out in April, or for that matter go and rent 2001.\n\nThis was a popcorn flick.\n\nThe story centers around Violet, citizen in a world where AIDS has been replaced by a blood- eating disorder called HGV; turning citizens into faster, stronger versions of themselves coupled with an allergy to sunlight and a need for sometimes constant blood transfusions.\n\nLet me translate that for you. VAMPIRES IN THE FUTURE.\n\nViolet becomes embroiled in a bitter struggle when she is sent to capture a \"weapon\" that turns out to be a Six, a child. Cue the sudden \"Man on Fire\" impulse to protect the little boy using her supreme skills of ass-kicking.\n\nonce again translated: MILLA IS GOING TO OPEN A CAN OF WOOP-DIDDY ON FOLKS.\n\nAny person, (any rational person) would be immediately turned away by the \"Vampires in the future\" bit as I was. I can recall sitting in the theater very vividly and mentally going \"....What?\" at the snark comments and Milla leaping like a faun on crack across the screen. \n\nAbout halfway through the film as Milla was facing down yet another room full of people who wanted her dead simply because she was Milla Jovovitch (perhaps they weren\u0027t happy with her work on Resident Evil: Apocalypse) It hit me like a slap in the face. This is a Hong Kong Style Action Movie.\n\nTrue it didn\u0027t have some of the more subtle plot nuances that a great deal of Hong Kong Action flicks do (Hell, Tarantino did it better) but that\u0027s what it was. Kurt Wimmer\u0027s growing contribution to a great number of Filmmakers and TV directors who have fallen in love with the far east. Sure it lacked the finesse of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (But that was Asian initially) It completely destroyed the stoic good nature of HERO, and it made no claim whatsoever to the deep and thought provoking message that the Matrix gave us.\n\nIt was fun. It was 88 minutes of Escape. Sure the fight scenes were repetitive, sure some of the concepts were unbelievable, but it was fun. \n\nIt shouldn\u0027t have reminded me of Kung Fu Hustle but some of the lines and blatant threats brought back memories of Characters silhouetted in hallways before holding out a hand and asking their antagonists to \"Come and get it\"\n\nToo often in movies today we\u0027re seeing \"remakes\" or rehashing of a proved concept time and time again. Hollywood is in dire straits, saddled with a plethora of remakes from it\u0027s brothers and sisters in neighboring countries. In desperation we\u0027re turning to our own past to find films to create fresh fodder for an uncompromising audience that demands total and complete entertainment catering to their specific whims.\n\nI don\u0027t applaud Kurt Wimmer for \"Vampires in the Future\" because-frankly-he could have done it better. I don\u0027t applaud Milla for illustrating once again that yes she has a very nice body and yes if called upon she could probably break most of us into tiny pieces. I applaud them however for trying for a spark of originality regardless of how ridiculous the concept and how much they borrowed from other sci-fi movies to make it.\n\nHe did the same thing for Equilibrium\n\nI\u0027ve seen bad movies. I\u0027ve searched desperately for some saving grace as characters bumble through lines and try to come off as serious-or jump start a franchise. Ultraviolet\u0027s not Equilibrium, (not by a long shot) but it still manages to be a fun good time at the movies.\n\nWill it win an Oscar? Of course not. Does it deserve accolades? not really. In a world where Hollywood is relying on zombie resurrection techniques to bring back life to an industry that\u0027s running out of it however I\u0027ll gladly overlook the \"Vampires in the Future\" concept and try to puzzle out a story. \n\nBecause hey. It could be Catwoman.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
