I watched it from start to finish and I\u0027m still amazed right now after watching the movie. The main point of the movie was to me, the viewer.\n\nThe attitude and responses Alex was giving is a personality of his own, he was himself and he showed he had style in his own way.\n\nI was stunned at times, The movie kept me sometimes on the edge of my chair waiting for the next thrill to happen, knowing I\u0027m going to be absolutely surprised again and again.\n\nThis movie is an absolute masterpiece, A movie which i enjoyed and a movie that didn\u0027t waste my time.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
