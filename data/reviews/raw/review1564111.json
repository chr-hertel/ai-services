Joanna and Alan - comic genius! But unless there\u0027s gonna be a third series i felt a little bit let down by it. What is Mac Dying of? (Cancer i\u0027m guessing from the hints you get) When is he going to die? Do Joanna and Alan actually die or just end up on a beach naked somewhere? I was so looking forward to Caroline and Mac finally getting together, but felt is was emotionless and weird - flying off in to the sky with some balloons?? Rubbish! Green wing is the best show on TV: The best actors the UK has to offer, excellent writing, and its normally so perfectly balanced between genuine drama and hilarious surreal humour... not this episode tho.. Shame...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
