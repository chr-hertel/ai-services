I was most pleasantly surprised to see a very entertaining film. I thought that Errol Flynn and the supporting cast were uniformly good. Errol again showed what a great star and actor he really was. The plot was plausible and the pace of the movie moved right along. I am surprised by the negative reviews. \"The Big Boodle\" is a more substantial film than many more critically acclaimed films... and,by that,I mean mainstream movies that are supposedly \"A\" quality. Errol brings a worldly weariness appropriate to his role. I was surprised to see how fit he appeared and how involved he was in his portrayal. I believe that he would have been magnificent as Rhett Butler in \"Gone With The Wind\" which he lost reportedly, due to Betty Davis\u0027 refusal to make that movie with him in the leading role. \"The Big Boodle\" shows what a serious and outstanding actor he was in even a modestly budgeted film", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
