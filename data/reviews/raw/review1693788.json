What do I mean by that? Pacing wise it takes the route classic war movies have taken before it and doesn\u0027t opt for the MTV Generation cuts/pace (I watched the nearly 3 hour version).\n\nI called this a war movie, but don\u0027t get excited about fight scenes, it\u0027s more a drama! Saying more than that, might spoil something so I leave it at that! Just be aware of that fact, before you watch the movie! It\u0027s very well acted and you\u0027re unaware of where this will go! Which I think is great! Although it changes kind of \"direction\" near the end, it fits the movie (imo).", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
