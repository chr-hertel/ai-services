I prefer a movie with some action and a lot more story telling I enjoyed this movie based on these facts the plot was good and presented a strong emotion to it between a farther and his son The acting was perfect Vincent Perez gave a great look to the crow his eyes are so deep and filled in sadness in this movie The movie is in a great location really giving L.A. a deep feel to it and I still don\u0027t see why people say this movie bad this movie by no means made me feel vile This movie is a work of art an 8 out of 10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
