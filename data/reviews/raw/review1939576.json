If you like this one, you\u0027ll love another two known as Bus Lane (cannot find on IMDb yet), and \"See How They Run\" (Thai \"Koy ter yuem\") http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0833486/ \n\nIf you are a thriller fan, keep your eyes on Thailand, as they tell very good ghost stories.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
