Sci-fi Channel has produced better made-for-TV movies, including Frankenfish and Lake Placid II. Yeah... I said it.\n\nWatch at your own risk. If you entered into the endeavor moderately intelligent, the stupidity gained as a result of watching this film will be temporary. If you entered into the viewing of this \"film\" with abject adoration, then I fear your newfound stupidity will stick. In such an instance, I\u0027ll be sure to pray for you.
