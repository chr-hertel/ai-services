Here\u0027s another Borowczyk short that is short on plot and I suppose the story should be in the viewer\u0027s eyes. I\u0027m sure the director had some point going in this film but it certainly never struck me as to what. Even though I didn\u0027t get the story itself the visuals in the film left me rather cold. The reddish tinting was a nice touch but I found the creativity in the visuals rather lacking. I\u0027m guessing one could say they were meant to be that way but it just didn\u0027t work for me. The short runs just under twelve-minutes with the first six showing us the factory without anything going on. The second half of the film is when everything comes to life and the angel is created." }
