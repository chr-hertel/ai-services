That\u0027s what I got it for - the music. The advertisement said, \"jubilant, revitalizing musical.\"\n\nWell, there are songs in here but they don\u0027t last long. Mostly, this is a documentary on Willie Mae Ford Smith and Tomas A. Dorsey, pioneers in black gospel music. They are wonderful people - solid Christians - but the documentary, quite frankly, is boring. \n\nIf one is a big fan of these two, it might be a jewel, but to fans who simply want a concert of gospel music, this isn\u0027t it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
