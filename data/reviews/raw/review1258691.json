Of course the main thread is the past and current relationship between the two rivals. The latter only hinted at later in the film.\n\nBut even apart from the protagonists, it is the diverse range of characters and their interaction that gives the film the depth it so well deserves.\n\nIt has just been cinema (Dec 2005) released in Australia and only to those few remaining Art House theaters. Go see it and if it\u0027s not showing near you, but it on DVD. It\u0027s a keeper.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
