Most of the gags are indeed pretty unusual by today\u0027s standards though many of these types were common in many \u002730s cartoons particularly the musical ones. Watching this, I was reminded of Flowers and Trees, Disney\u0027s first three-strip Technicolor cartoon that won the Oscar two years later. Mainly because of the human-like trees and the way they made music. So, in summation, The Tree\u0027s Knees is highly recommended for anyone interested in early Warner Bros. animation before Tex Avery and many of the characters created in his wake gave the studio a new attitude...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
