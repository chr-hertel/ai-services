Edgy as an HBO show, spiritual as 7th Heaven, and as beautifully dysfunctional as Six Feet Under. Aiden Quinn brings an offbeat rudder to this ship of wonderfully happy dysfunctional family. A talented cast of familiar faces play straight men to the priest and his tribe. A spiritual adviser offers well placed advice which, I\u0027m sure, puts the Christian right on edge. Ellen Bursten is rediscovered as the pill popping Bishop while the acceptance of the gay son is the first truly poignant integration of a true gay role in a true family.\n\nThe closest drama to a true reality show on television. Welcome back NBC" }
