There\u0027s something pathetically real about the guy and the characters he creates and portrays in his movies. But what about the movies themselves? Hannah and Her Sisters is his best film, IMO, and is an intricate, entertaining movie that doesn\u0027t try to be \"all that NYC chic\", like Annie Hall, for instance.\n\nConversely, Sleeper is everything that HaHS is not and nothing that it is. Imagine a movie version of James Halperin\u0027s The First Immortal directed by and starring Charlie Chaplin, throw in a dash of know-it-all New York cynicism and you\u0027ve just about got it.\n\nThere are words that describe how terrifically bad this movie is, but it depresses me to waste time writing them. Suffice it to say that if not for the existence of the muppety The Dark Crystal, Sleeper would be the worst movie I\u0027ve ever seen on purpose. And yes, this analysis does include the late-night Cinemax flicks starring Tawny Kitaen that I used to stay up all night to watch, hoping for a glimpse of tawny thigh...\n\nAll I could do was wish for it to be over, but even at 89 minutes it was interminable. Thankfully I fell asleep twice, but never for long. My wife dislikes Woody intently - if this had been the first Woody movie I saw, she would be a happier woman, because I never would have brought home another.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
