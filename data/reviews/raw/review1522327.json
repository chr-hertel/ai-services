The movie is filmed in the best locations in the world. Daniel Craig is a good actor as James Bond 007, but Pierce Brosnan and Sean Connery were better Bonds. Over all An action packed Movie,some Humour, The Originality of earlier James Bond movies like the train ride,the beach scene, the old Aston Martin,the Vodka martini, best part is that the beginning of the movie is at the end of it.Eva Green looks awesome without any make-up in front of the bathroom mirror, Bond is wearing ST.Dupont cuff-lings. Alessandra Ambrosia is also there in the film for a second or two.\n\nMust see for all Spy fans!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
