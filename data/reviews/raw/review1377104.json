Cause I kept thinking of them as a couple than relationship.\n\nThey\u0027re driving the countryside on a road with almost no cars at all.\n\nTill a mysterious old truck comes by and try to make their car crash.\n\nAfter a near escape the brother wants to know what is up with that Driver that nearly killed them.\n\nThey trace the truck to an abandon church. The brother explores around till he find a large pipe which he decides to enter. His sister tells him not to but he didn\u0027t listen. Once he was down at the bottom, he discovers the basement to be a hell like place. Something he wouldn\u0027t expect the truck driver to be doing.\n\nAnd the truck driver himself is not what he appears to be.\n\nThis movie is close from being crappy. Good side not as stupid as the Saw movies. Down side it needed a better direction. So not on my best horror film list. If you you like low budget horror flicks, then see about renting this movie. But don\u0027t expect it to be very great.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
