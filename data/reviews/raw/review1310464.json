Despite some amusing situations along the way, nothing can keep an audience from knowing that a happy ending is around the bend.\n\nIt gives Lana Turner a chance to display her ample charms in some brief and very sexy dancing outfits while at the same time enjoying herself in a refreshing comedy role peppered with some romance. Richard Carlson does nicely as her college boyfriend and Artie Shaw keeps things humming along with some nice big band music.\n\nIt\u0027s strictly by the numbers but Turner\u0027s fans will all agree she\u0027s quite a knockout here. Turner at the height of her pulchritude was something the camera loved.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
