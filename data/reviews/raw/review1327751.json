Kevin Spacey did a remarkable job so at one and relaxed Annette Bening WOWED! me it was definitely her best performance. It was a very compelling story and amazing a 5 star \u0027UNMISSABLE story which is almost not a story a part of life and fact which we experience it should be watch as it is defiantly one at the best films of the nineties one of the best of the last ten years it is so hard not to like it it is one of my favourite films a 5 Oscar 6 BAFTA Award winner REMARKABLE! by Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening 10/10 COMPELING TERRIFIC OUTSTANDING FILM", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
