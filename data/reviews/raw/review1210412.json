In fact, this is just the problem with most comic-inspired films - they take themselves too seriously, and I suppose the audiences do also. The Shadow is great fun, and has a goofy Freudian side to it as well. The only comic superhero films that are as good are the Spiderman films, and Batman Begins. The rest are only worth watching to see the performance of this or that superstar. Of course all the good ones have just about the same story line - tormented superhero must battle villains to save humanity while keeping his identity secret and protecting his loved ones - but that is beside the point. If you want a film that is true to its roots, you can\u0027t do better than The Shadow.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
