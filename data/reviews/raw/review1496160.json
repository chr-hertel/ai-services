Believe me, it\u0027s not even close. Far from it, this film probably spends most of its life on the shelf at your local video store, removed sporadically for viewing by some soon-to-be-disappointed film nut, checking it out for to discover what all the hoopla isn\u0027t about only to discover that this is no \"Donnie Darko\". \n\nThe blame for this dismal failure falls on writer-director, Richard Kelly, whose flawed myriad of confusing back stories completely undermines some mildly interesting stuff that he had going on before tanking it. Kelly\u0027s ill-conceived story renders \"Southland Tales\" as nothing more than a disappointing and lengthy \"wannabe\" of \"Donnie Darko\" except this is a story that lost me somewhere in the middle. But, unlike \"Donnie Darko, \"Southland Tales\" fails dismally because in the end, one feeling completely cheated, if not, in my case, disgusted.\n\nYou can\u0027t fault the investors who shelled out hard cash for this project cuz they probably thought Kelly would come through with another gem like \"Darko\". The fault is Kelly\u0027s alone. He really botched this one.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
