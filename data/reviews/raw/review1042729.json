This Movie so Deeply affects you on so Many Levels. As An African American Man, I Sat and Watched this Movie With My family And My Heart Broke, I\u0027m not ashamed to say it brought me to tears. The Performacees in this Movie Will Haunt you Deeply, I Think.....No I believe That If The United States Had Done Something That The Countless and Needless Slaughter Would Have Been Stopped Dead in it\u0027s Tracks. We As Americans Need To Hold Our Politcians and Military Leaders Accountable for Their Actions or As I Should Really Say Non-action. We Are The Free World So We Say At a Moment\u0027s Notice Without Even Thinking About it, But Doesn\u0027t Freedom Include the right To Live......This Movie Will Rock Your soul. I believe Debra Winger And The Cast of this Movie Should take the Emmy Easily. This Movie Is a Powerhouse of Emotion, It\u0027s Not Pretty, It Doens\u0027t have a Nice Little Ending, It\u0027s Painful Yet Inspiring, Because My Friends This Movie Inspires You To Love Your Self And Your Family that Much More, Because You Just Might Not Make it to See another day. I Give this Movie a 10/10 Amazing", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
