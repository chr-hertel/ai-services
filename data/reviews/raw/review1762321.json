Credit goes to the writer for the clever story and the director for bringing it so brilliantly on screen. Of course, for me it was quite easy to predict who the killer was but I liked how the mystery unfolds and the locations are a charming addition. The charismatic Grant and the beautiful Hepburn form a slightly odd but funnily romantic couple. There\u0027s certainly no doubt that both are great actors and they share a very warm chemistry. Walter Matthau too is funnily (and quite suitably) awkward. The rest if the cast contribute well. \u0027Charade\u0027 is truly one classic thriller and even today it remains a very enjoyable film. It certainly stood the test of time and even non-classic fans will enjoy this one." }
