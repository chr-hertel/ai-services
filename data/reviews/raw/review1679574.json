I think I actually liked it more on the second viewing. The film is richly textured with great characterization and acting. I have to say that I think it was the best film to come out of 2006. When Rocky Balboa was announced people rolled their eyes stating Stallone was trying to capitalize on a film franchise that was worn out. I\u0027ve been a fan of Stallone for a long time and I never once thought this when I heard the news. I won\u0027t lie and say that I knew it was going to be good, but I had faith in Stallone creating something more than an easy paycheck. The film he created delivered.. tremendously. It has so much heart and emotion behind it. The character of Rocky is a very simple man, he doesn\u0027t have all the smarts, but what he does have is heart. I think the world would be a better place if we all had a little bit of Rocky\u0027s character in us. Stallone has created a bookend to a series that has seen its ups and downs. But one that will live on for a very, very long time.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
