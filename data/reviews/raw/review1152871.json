I have heard about Tetsuo: The Ironman for a number of years, but because I am not a fan of science fiction, I put off watching the film. However, after watching Tsukamoto\u0027s Bullet Ballet and A Snake of June I became interested in watching the film that put him on the map. I must say that my first viewing of the film, during which I continuously dozed off, did not leave me with an overwhelming urge to watch the film again. Yet, I figured that there must be a reason why fans and a few critics, including Tom Mes, thought that the film was quite a piece of work. Therefore I decided to watch the film again. I enjoyed the film more the second time around, but I still do not know why the film is so popular.\n\nFilmed during the late 1980s, Tetsuo: The Ironman stars Taguchi Tomorowo stars as a character simply known as the \"Salaryman\" who one day along with his girlfriend crash into a pedestrian in a hit and run accident and afterwards dump the man\u0027s body in the woods. Also, for some reason or another, the couple decides to have sex before the man who has yet to die. However, unfortunately for the couple, the man was no ordinary man. Referred to as \"the Fetishist\" in the subbed DVD, the man inserts metal objects into his body fusing rusted metal with his own flesh. Although the Salaryman and his girlfriend try to get on with their lives after the accident, things begin to go astray when the Salaryman notices a metal prong protruding from his cheek.\n\nShot completely in black and white, the first fifteen minutes or so of the movie is quite stimulating because of its fast-paced action sequences, strangeness, and pulsating background music of Ishikawa Chu. However, for me anyway, the film grows a bit dull after thirty minutes because while visually stimulating, I would of liked the film to have more of a story.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
