Similar stories abound. It takes a monumental effort to get anything made that\u0027s a little bit different. Guys who control the money don\u0027t like risk! With all its iterations depending on the focus of the potential underwriter -- think Money-Man -- with a colorful cast of stars, all playing well-written characters, I can\u0027t get enough of this movie. I own it and have watched it many times. A real laugh fest for those captivated by all things \"Hollywood.\" The name IMHO ruined this movie\u0027s chances at the box office. It implies a certain salaciousness that is simply not there. It is a warm and sweet movie about guys trying to help their sweethearts achieve their dreams. Should have been titled, \u0027The Darkness and the Light,\u0027 which is the name of the screenplay they are trying to produce, or \u0027A Hollywood Story,\u0027 or something similarly innocuous. Worth seeing by all means!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
