It\u0027s not a David Lynch, so I got more than 10% of it, but it\u0027s not an easy film. I don\u0027t regret watching it, and I will watch it again (some day) to see I\u0027ve I can get the (whole) picture. Still (and I don\u0027t consider myself a brain-dead cine lover) I didn\u0027t find it an easy movie...\n\nGo see it, but go with caution. PS: I sincerely believe I will review my vote upwards in a few months time.\n\nCheck out Carol O\u0027Connel - one of the best writers around", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
