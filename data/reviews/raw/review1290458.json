That is why i bought the DVD and saw it myself at home. Overall the action is good, the costume, not too bad but the story itself kind of dull/empty.\n\nThe leading actor and actress are wonderful. They act perfectly and they deserves compliment from this movie.\n\nThe car, well, that\u0027s marvelous, superb and totally enjoyable but too bad that we can\u0027t see the interior of it. From outside they look good but from inside, we never know because this is only a movie and everybody can messed around with the props or even the characters.\n\nMake new story and better plot because the story is pretty long and very boring.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
