I think of it as a whodunit that happens to have a supernatural element.\n\nI liked it that practically the whole movie takes place on one working class block in Chicago where everyone seems to know each other. Some of these people are keeping a terrible crime a secret. I liked it that when Bacon finds the corpse and comes to discover what the crime was, it\u0027s not the ending of the movie. More surprises to come, and the revelations make perfect sense.\n\nAlso, the movie has Ileana Douglas, who I always enjoy seeing.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
