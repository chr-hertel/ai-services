Two hours after seeing the movie I still felt like I had just left the ship. It was a crazy wild ride with anticipation around every corner. This movie far exceeded my expectations. I was hoping that it would keep true to the original. It paralleled the original in a unique way but also had so many differences that every corner had an unexpected twist. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. I want to see it again right now! I would recommend this movie to everyone-especially those who remember and love the original. I haven\u0027t enjoyed a movie this much in years. A+++ My faith is restored in Hollywood!!!! Kudo\u0027s Warner Brother\u0027s! Great Job! :)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
