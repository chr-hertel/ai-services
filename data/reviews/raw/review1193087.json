The opening sequence in this movie is poorly acted and has some bad gags that could of turned out better if it was acted better. But don\u0027t have a negative attitude towards this movie forever after that. After the movie gets going it becomes funnier and the actors that did poorly in the beginning suddenly start doing well. And it is great for rest of the movie.\n\nThe jokes in this movie (bar the opening sequence) are very funny and sometimes very original. There are some good laugh out loud moments. \n\nActing wise it is pretty good (once again, bar the opening sequence). Some good cameos throughout too.\n\nOverall it is not the funniest movie ever but it is very entertaining. It may be enjoyed more if you are a fan of hip hop and/or hood movies but I\u0027m pretty sure someone not familiar with that whole scene will still enjoy this movie. A funny, original comedy.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
