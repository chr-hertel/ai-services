It moved me to tears, especially because I had relatives die in the Holocaust. The people of Whitwell, Tennessee, deserve world-wide recognition as humanitarians and for their outstanding efforts. This film restores faith in human kind and the goodness in people. The story starts out simple enough, but soon it escalates and we witness an enormous undertaking that is highlighted by dedicating a memorial to the 11 million people that died in the Holocaust. It was thoughtful to give recognition to the 5 million other victims that also perished. Bravo to the film makers, bravo to the people of Whitwell!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
