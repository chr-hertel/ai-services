I videotaped it at the time, but my ancient videos are wearing out from constant playing. When will this be released on a DVD? I can\u0027t believe some of the rubbish that comes out on DVD, and this never has. Great songs, a brilliant plot (it was a good book), and the way they just break into dancing and singing! It also had some sad and serious moments, which were never overplayed and a very good cast,too. This series never got the exposure it deserved, being relegated to the daytime schedule after just one showing in prime-time. It was probably too \"different\" to catch on back in 1980, but I\u0027m sure there must be others like me who loved it. One of my all time favourites. Bring out the DVD! Please!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
