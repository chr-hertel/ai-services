What else can i say? I\u0027m a 22 Year old male, and i do have a daughter of my own, this movie was great, from the start i was glued to the screen and i was still there at the end, and i didn\u0027t even move to grab a drink, or go the loo.\n\nI found this movie very emotional, and near the end i was almost in tears, and had a lump in my throat.. i\u0027m not ashamed to admit that.\n\nWhat Jacey did was amazing and was a very tough decision for her, and i feel i can relate to how she felt, as i have been in this situation myself. I will certainly buy the DVD for this once its out. \n\n10/10. Well done.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
