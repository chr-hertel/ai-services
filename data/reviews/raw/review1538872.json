The acting wasn\u0027t bad and the cinematography was pretty. That\u0027s about it.\n\nOn the bad side there is plenty. The plot could have been written on the back of a postage stamp. And what plot there was, was so clich√©d and obvious - it doesn\u0027t take long to work out what is going to happen and surprise, surprise it does, and to use not one but two deus ex machina events is plain laziness. \n\nBut aside from the poor plot this film is awash with gratuitous, unnecessary violence. Whereas directors such as Cronenberg, Kubrick or Lynch use sporadic but intense violence for great dramatic effect, Gibson just gives us cut throat after cut throat, heart being ripped out after heart being ripped out and it frankly becomes boring and stupid.\n\nIn fact stupid is a good word for this film. The film offers nothing - it doesn\u0027t try to understand or dissect Mayan culture and neither does it offer a commentary on the modern world.\n\nIt is long, boring and totally pointless.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
