This movie is a serious stinker. Bad special effects, terrible plot points seemingly ripped straight out of the Matrix and Tron, and meanderings into N*Sync dance routines really hamstring this movie from the get-go. I didn\u0027t exactly hate it, but it was one of the last domestically available Miike flicks that I hadn\u0027t seen and now I know how this one filtered down to the bottom of the list. Sure, there are a handful of scenes that could be called Miike-ian: (the assassin guy turning and looking pensively down the illuminated hallway, the bats flying in the city street, the blossoms falling beneath the beach sakura tree . . .). But for the most part, the film is just a cheesy vehicle for Speed to try and prove that they can act. No dice, ladies.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
