Not thinking much of it and not seeing s Werner Herzog film before I didn\u0027t really have any grand expectations. As I watched this film however, I became more and more enthralled. This was quite entertaining even though the acting may be mediocre and the sounds may also have been sub-par. The work by the cinematographer and just the way the entire film was put together, especially the introductory scenes and the end scenes was just plain magnificent. Granted, I did watch the film in German with the subtitles so I don\u0027t know about any poor dubbing or anything, I would have to say that this is one mighty-fine film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
