It\u0027s hitting the big screen in select markets having won a host of indie awards. It\u0027s one you don\u0027t want to miss. Strong theme, content, excellent acting and well worth viewing -- an African American film that draws on a dying mother\u0027s (Vanessa Williams) love for her children; an older brother\u0027s love and commitment for his younger, special needs brother; and the ever complicated human element of care-taking both heartwarming and heart-wrenching. It deserves to be seen everywhere. My Brother is coming to some big markets. Look for it in you area and take the time to go see it. You\u0027ll be glad you did. Good luck to the folks working on this great project.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
