Boynton Beach Club adeptly deals with the major life themes of love and loss, the awkwardness of starting over and the resilience of the human spirit at any age. The stellar ensemble cast brought honesty, humor and empathetic discomfort to the real world dilemma\u0027s that come with internet dating and single\u0027s groups or that anxious first date feeling that is the same whether you are 16 or 60. Sudden widowhood not only forced the spouse to see themselves in new roles but confronted their children with looking at them as people, perhaps for the first time, rather than the role of mom or dad that they had been locked into for decades. Some very refreshing role reversal too. This is an all too rare opportunity to see a fine group of thespian\u0027s in roles that are worthy of them and of the audience. I hope this is the first of many to come. If a movie can make the boomer\u0027s a little less apprehensive about the impending golden years this is the one. If a movie can make the next generation look at boomer\u0027s and seniors more like vibrant people than relics this is the one. You will laugh and sigh and maybe cry when you see this movie. But more importantly you will vote with the only thing Hollywood understands these days, your dollars. Let them know we want more movies like this, we will pay to see them and we have more time and money to spend at the movies than the 20 year old\u0027s they seem to exclusively cater to. I will see this movie again and this time I\u0027m taking the kids!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
