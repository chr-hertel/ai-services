The mystery is a well-mounted one with some nice twists to be had. The roof-top climax and shocking conclusion is quite worth the wait as well! The direction is sleek and the music score of Ennio Morricone is beautiful.\n\nCast-wise the film is good as well, James Franciscus and Karl Malden steal the show though as an unlikely pair of investigators.\n\nMost people don\u0027t rate this film as one of Argento\u0027s best, even Argento himself declares it his least favorite film, but Cat O\u0027 Nine Tails still deserves to be seen - if only by Argento fans.\n\n*** out of ****", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
