In doing so they think they disturb someone who then speeds away from the house in a very flash black Mustang. What they do not know is that there was nobody human in this car as the mustang is one of Graiman\u0027s projects  an artificially intelligent supercar who has clear instructions what to do in the event of harm coming to Graiman, find his daughter (who also knows the codes) and then seek help from former ranger Mike Traceur. Despite his vast intelligence and resources though, KITT is only a step or two ahead of the mercenaries.\n\nIdle curiosity, that\u0027s what started me watching the pilot for the remake (or reboot as everything must now be called) of Knight Rider. I of course watched the show as a child but I hold no special place in my heart for it and I certainly wasn\u0027t watching this with the plan of immediately going onto the net to debate the type of car they have made KITT, the new voice, the lack of turbo boost and all sorts of stuff that I have seen written here under the guise of judging the pilot film. No, for me I was just looking for it to entertain me and perhaps interest me enough to watch the series later. Well, the pilot is fairly generic stuff and you can see that it is aimed squarely at a teenager/student type market because the focus is on the action, good-looking characters, slick camera work etc. Those seeking dense plotting and convincing characters should just head back to their \"The Wire\" box-sets right now because there is none of it here. The pilot does have it quite easy though because with the basic frame in place, the rest is filled with establishing material putting the characters in place and introducing them to the viewer  something that the series will not have for long.\n\nEven then it manages to be basic. The whole thing knows not to sit still for very long and is always moving forward as a result. It doesn\u0027t matter if that movement makes sense or if the events are usually coincidental or convenient to help the writers out, as long as it all keeps moving. This produces an amiable enough film that fills the time and is distracting but not one that is ever thrilling or gripping. Deaths of characters didn\u0027t phase or interest me that much and the car action, while undoubtedly professionally done and very slick, never made me excited or impressed me that much. And this is its problem is that it is \"OK\" and \"OK\" shows generally do \"OK\" when they are aiming at a target audience not known for patience, staying power or long attention spans. It all looks good though but without a real sense of danger or emotional hook to make the viewer care then it will put a lot of pressure onto the plots which, on the basis of this outing, will not be much more than serviceable.\n\nSpeaking of serviceable, the cast are mostly par for the course when it comes to this sort of television. Bruening is a pretty boy with charisma and a good body. He doesn\u0027t appear to have a lot of range to him but it is not like the film pushes him in that regard. Russo seems a bit more able and she is a charming presence on the screen. Davison is a face that takes the old Devon role I guess and he does OK with that. Poitier made me feel like she was doing me a favour by being in this  her performance is flat and unconvincing, like just showing up and saying her lines would be enough. She even makes Kasserman look like he is pushing envelopes, which is something when you consider his cookie-cutter geek character. Ellis is a solid baddie who could have done more if given the chance by the material.\n\nOverall, outside of the fan boys, the message board wars and all sorts of stuff like that, is the Knight Rider film any good as a standalone piece? Well, the answer is \"not really\". It does the basics well as one would expect from something with a bit of money spent on it, but it doesn\u0027t have an edge to make me sit up and pay attention. Undemanding fluff to be on in the corner while my brain winds down perhaps, but even then it is quite light on the meat to fill the time. I\u0027ll not rush to the series on the basis of this an, if it comes my way then I\u0027ll still be maybe because, while polished, this is all very \"meh\"." }
