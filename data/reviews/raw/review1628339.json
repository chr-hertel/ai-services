When I hear that the same guys were coming out with a new movie I just couldn\u0027t wait. And the result is great. A fast pace, British comedy at it\u0027s very best. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost show yet again great teamwork as they have done before in Spaced and Shaun of the Dead. This movie is a bit slow going in the beginning but when the action begins it really goes nuts. I haven\u0027t laughed so hard in the theater since I saw Borat last year. So if you loved Shaun of the Dead or just want to see some great comedy this is the stuff for you, although its not good for the squeamish one. 10 out of 10, with out a doubt.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
