Basically the flick is about \"survival of the fittest\" withing gangs. It tells the story of several gang-members moving out to another part of the city where sh8t hits the fan. They get in trouble with 4 other gangs.\n\nFight scenes are really fun.\n\nJust don\u0027t expect Hollywood quality regarding special effect (thats the only thing they can do right). The acting talent is also pretty poor.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
