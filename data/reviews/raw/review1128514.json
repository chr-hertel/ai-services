Carefully-paced and plotted film has a lot of talk from incidental characters who don\u0027t amount to much; however, the central idea is still very intriguing. The film is far-fetched in places (watch out for the scene where Jon Voight easily infiltrates the castle where Nazi Maximilian Schell resides), yet it has suspenseful passages. Voight isn\u0027t particularly well-cast in the lead (he\u0027s doesn\u0027t look or sound German, and he seems too young for this role), but he displays his usual innate sensitivity. Schell is strong in a taut sequence near the finish, although the set-up for this is an old movie stand-by: keep the captor talking long enough so that he can save himself. The tag at the end is bungled by director Ronald Neame, which leaves a hollow feeling in the picture\u0027s wake.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
