It\u0027s well-done... the acting is fine and the directing and writing are decent... but over-all the movie just seems to be missing the final spark to set the whole thing aflame. Zach Braff (of TV\u0027s best sitcom, Scrubs) stars as a severely depressed actor, hooked on medication, who returns to his old hometown for his mother\u0027s funeral. He faces some childhood issues and, with the help of a funny, spunky (and underage???) girl he meets in a hospital waiting room, he gets off his pills and starts to enjoy life once again. How many movies has Natalie Portman been in now where she plays the funny, spunky (underage?) girl who is the catalyst for the renewal of an older man\u0027s appreciation of life? (Leon The Professional, Beautiful Girls, Closer... can we work Star Wars in there somehow?) Maybe the problem with the movie is just that it starts out so slow and ponderous as it sets up the bleak, depressive state of its main character? Maybe if it had started with him meeting Natalie Portman and then working backwards to explain his condition it might have been easier to sit through? Anyway, a nice try from director/writer Braff... but it just didn\u0027t work for me." }
