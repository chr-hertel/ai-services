This kind of crap just adds to those uncomputer savvy moron\u0027s paranoid delusions that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus. First of all, strings of code and dozens of 1s and 0s add up to computer virus. An organic virus is much more complex, even though it\u0027s way tinier. Though, it\u0027s considered one of the simplest forms in the universe, organic virus\u0027s attach burrow into your cells and attach themselves to the RNA, then change your own RNA code. Explain to me how something like that could be processed from a monitor? Maybe the radiation has some effect on the user\u0027s cornea that turns your eyeballs into these viruses? I could see that, but obviously, the writer didn\u0027t think of that.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
