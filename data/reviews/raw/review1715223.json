The \u002780s is one of the foremost decades for producing movies that were \"of their time\" and this is no exception. For many, the enchantment is closely tied to nostalgia for their childhood, and it is certainly true that many of the markers in our lifetimes are cultural references.\n\nHowever, as with \"Gremlins\"  which is slyly referenced in this movie  nostalgia tends to overlook the technical aspects of film-making. Objectively, \"The Goonies\" does not fare so well. Part of the problem is inherent in most of the cast being young children, and then asking them to all shout or scream loudly at once with their high-pitched voices, and have a murky sound mix try to cleanly catch the dialogue. Another problem is that once the gang set off on their quest down myriad tunnels and caves, with a restaurant fireplace substituting for the rabbit-hole, it is not easy to follow the trail and put together a sense of exactly where they are in each scene and how it ties to where they were in the last one. There are also times when the \"this is our time\" speeches by Sean Astin\u0027s character come off as being a little too heavy-handed.\n\nYet another problem is the cutting of a couple of filmed scenes that cause slight disjoints in the narrative. Suddenly the treasure map is significantly damaged without due explanation, and there is a reference to an octopus that is nowhere to be found in the final print. The deleted scenes which explain these plot points are available on DVD.\n\nThe film could also have used clearer elucidation in other places, including the attic scene in which the map is discovered, and perhaps a word or two of exactly why a pirate ship was off the Oregon coast pursued by the British as soon as the early 1600s. Not that the origin of the back-story makes or breaks this movie, which should be seen first and foremost as pure escapist fantasy. On that basis, the film comes through pretty well, and while it is not a particularly great movie, it does enough to merit the place it has in so many people\u0027s hearts.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
