I found an mp3 of the Chapi Chapo theme song and was in heaven. There were a lot of good \"shorts\" on Pinwheel and this was certainly one of them. \n\nI truly wish Nickelodeon (or one of its offspring channels) would start showing some of these programs. A lot of what inspires me now as an adult stems from some of the programming I used to watch back then. I\u0027m afraid there\u0027s nothing out there as peculiar as some of the shows that used to appear on TV 20 years ago or so.\n\nIn addition to Chapi Chapo, Pinwheel had \"Bagpuss\" another stop-motion animated thing as well as \"Emily\" about a girl who always wore red and her adventures with her brother and sister. I really miss those shows and wish I could find them again." }
