After watching all of the special edition material, I really gained a greater appreciation from this movie. The sound effects add such a greater depth to the film, the new cleaned up soundtrack adds such a great dimension that completes the whole world of the movie. The cinematography, atmosphere, added special effects are excellent as well.. and I disagree with the naysayers who don\u0027t think the added effects are called for. They just complete the vision of the director. \n\nI think the reason I like it so much though is because I can very much believe the storyline, I can see our society turning into the world of THX... it\u0027s about a quarter of the way there.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
