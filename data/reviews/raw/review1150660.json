Written by Ehren Kruger Directed by Iain Softley Rated PG-13 contains language,violence, gore and partial nudity. I just came from seeing the new Kate Hudson chiller The Skeleton Key and I must say that I\u0027m impressed. You want original. You want creative. You want smart. You want scary. You want suspense. You want this film. Hudson stars in top notch form as Caroline a young woman whom takes up a job with an elderly man and woman to care for the man because he\u0027s dying after having a mysterious stroke. She moves into a Texas Chainsaw style house in the Louisianna bayou brimming with history, creaky floors and odd occurrences. She morphs into a little detective and begins convincing herself slowly of the houses disturbing history, a black magic religion and the fact that it just may be haunted. And that\u0027s all I\u0027m giving away. Because this movie is toppling over with unpredictable plot twists and a killer ending that will have people talking for months to come. Iain Softley of Hackers and K-Pax directs with a passionate spooky, old-fashioned zest he keeps things suspenseful with a few shocks and intelligent pacing. The best thing about this film is the fact that you feel so smart watching it you are Caroline and as she discovers things so do you instead of knowing about them and just waiting for her character to catch up. The movie moves slowly in it\u0027s first two thirds mounting the suspense, building the tension with a brooding score, Oscar calibur camera work and drear inducing cinematography. The performances are fantastic as well Hudson is wonderfully scared in the film\u0027s lead she makes her character likable and endearing, Rowlands is one creepy broad, Hurt is mute and transits more terrified emotion through his face than most people have ever done in a horror film. Even Peter Sarsgard as the family\u0027s hunky lawyer and spunky Joy Bryant give winning supporting performances. So there it is people. A Horror film thats a rare thing. One brimming with intelligence, sweaty palm inducing suspense, nightmarish shocks, winning performances and a killer ending. the only fault the film slightly has in it\u0027s simplistic horrific brilliance is the tales from the cryptish last frame but it still soars high above it\u0027s competition and more than makes up for it in the rest of the film. So go see it, right now!The Key to good horror!THE SKELETON KEY. A-", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
