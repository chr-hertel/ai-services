But when it becomes clear that he has no desire other than to eat them, they see it as their patriotic duty to defend themselves.\n\nWhat I mean by associating \"The Fifth-Column Mouse\" with \"Animal House\" is that not only is the house inhabited by non-human fauna, but that dog-looking tank was sort of like the Deathmobile from which John Belushi emerged dressed as a pirate.\n\nI\u0027m probably the only person who would think that. Heck, I\u0027m apparently the first person reviewing this cartoon. Do I like it? Well, I consider the cartoon worth seeing. It\u0027s an OK, not great cartoon.
