Because failure to do so may cause you to waste your precious time.\n\nI learn it the hard way. I decided to watch this film even though my instinct told me not to.\n\nThis film is bad from the get go. The cast is terrible (LOL DMX as the main guy? You have got to be kidding me!). And the other actors weren\u0027t that convincing either.\n\nAnd the worst part of this film is the camera angles. It is so amateurish and lacked quality. It was like watching high school kids doing some assignment for the schoolwork.\n\nVerdict : DMX can\u0027t act . Period ." }
