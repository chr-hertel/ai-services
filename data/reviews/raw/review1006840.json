I didn\u0027t see anything controversial in its handling of the 9/11 Bombings. People who opposed the Points of View expressed in \"Hamburg Plot\" were probably the same people who felt that Osama Bin Laden shouldn\u0027t have been Time Magazine\u0027s Man of the Year (when he clearly should have been). America believes in dissent and the characters in the \"Hamburg Cell\" expressively portrayed a certain point of View. I agree overall with the rating of 6/7 Given the movie. This was a good movie that showed a different point of View. I especially liked the Male and Female Leads.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
