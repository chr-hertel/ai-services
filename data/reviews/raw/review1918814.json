Some of the best acting I\u0027ve ever seen in a movie. Heath Ledgers joker easily matches Jack Nicholson\u0027s performance in The Shining (1980) and quite possibly surpasses it.\n\nGreat storyline and lots of twists and turns, completely unpredictable ones too. The whole movie is action packed. There\u0027s quite a good comedic element to the movie as well.\n\nAll in all one of the best movies ever (maybe not as good as The Godfather but is very close) and it will be making you want to watch it again and again just to catch all of those minor details you might have missed the first, second, or third time you saw it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
