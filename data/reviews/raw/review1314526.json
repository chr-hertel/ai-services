I don\u0027t know if this was just my first experience of the IMAX, but you are literally, transported into space. The opening four or five minutes is an interesting teaser that really leaves you begging for more external space shots, you long to be space walking for the rest of the film.\n\nThe brief interviews with the astronaut keep the pace of the documentary moving nicely and often, there are really impressive moments when you just feel like reaching out and grabbing whatever\u0027s on screen. This could be anything from a steel bar attached to the outside ship to a blob of water actually heading for the camera/your face. This is where the point of view style camera comes into play. It\u0027s cleverly shot so that although it\u0027s not always happening; other Astronaut glance at you momentarily, not spoiling the mood by looking directly at you and the interviews are spaced evenly which gives the feel you are up there, talking to people and finding out information every now and again at your own pace rather than having all this information thrown at you at once. Good stuff.\n\nI\u0027d highly recommend seeing this film, if only once as the sheer unbelievableness of it is something to behold. Even if it wasn\u0027t in 3D, it\u0027s still a pretty interesting documentary on what\u0027s actually going on up there and no, I\u0027m not a \u0027science geek\u0027, in-fact the sci-fi genre is one of my least favourites. I just like a good blend of information, stunning visuals and a day out at an IMAX cinema.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
