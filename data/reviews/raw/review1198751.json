I was very upset when Fox cancelled The American Embassy. I really got into watching it and found its story very intriguing...but, alas, Fox cancelled.\n\nAnother recent show Fox cancelled was The Inside. What were they thinking? The only show they brought back onto air after cancellation (that I know of)after realizing they made a huge HUGE mistake was Family Guy. And, only after Adult Swim aired the episodes, did Fox face their mistakes.\n\nHopefully, they\u0027ll face more! Unlikely though. This has really become a habit - a bad one! Sigh." }
