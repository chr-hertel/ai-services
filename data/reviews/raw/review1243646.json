I watch it any time I\u0027ve been to see a stinker in the theatre, and it makes EVERYthing all better!!!\n\nIf you are a civil war movie buff, a war movie lover, a history lover or just a lover of art, then Glory is not a movie anyone should miss. If you are fortunate enough to find this movie for sale somewhere, I would not hesitate to pick it up because it is worth owning (and I don\u0027t own many movies), but if you can only find it to rent, then go and get it... NOW!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
