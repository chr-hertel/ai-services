Pacino soon puts him through a metamorphosis of changing his name to John Anthony, and making him a general swinger-cigar smoking, with a drink in his hand kind of guy knowing full well how to use the f word. Pacino soon puts him on his cable station and John Anthony, with his football predictions and sly style, soon becomes a sensation. People will go along with his wagers and gamble heavily themselves.\n\nNaturally, we have the mob involved. When he does well, John is everyone\u0027s boy; when the tables start to turn mobster \"Armand Assante\" shows how little he can regard human dignity and I\u0027m putting that mildly.\n\nThe picture though is a positive one. Showing that gambling is nothing more than suckers guessing who will win, it depicts when it\u0027s time to get out. This was one time you don\u0027t want to get out because of the usual outstanding performance of Al Pacino and Matthew McConaughey, the guy who Pacino makes as John Anthony.\n\nA searing look into the world of gambling. All bets are on for this rather good film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
