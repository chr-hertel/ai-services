That cover image is from the 1998 film also known as Voodoo Dawn (aka: Fait Accompli) which starred Michael Madsen and Rosanna Arquette. This film was released 8 years prior and in my opinion is a much better movie, although that isn\u0027t saying much considering the comparison. It is actually about voodoo/zombies whereas the other is more of a crime melodrama. The 1990 Voodoo Dawn isn\u0027t Oscar worthy itself but it does have its cheesy charm. If you are a zombie fan (like me) be prepared for more traditionally created zombies than the Romero shamble-type zombies. This movie also has an early appearance of Tony Todd before he became Candyman.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
