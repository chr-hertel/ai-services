Blunt, Neill and Sarandon all play their roles excellently and it\u0027s a shame that this movie is not available for wider audience. Unpredictable plot without cheap Hollywood tricks and scenes makes this film a hidden gem. All actors do they work really well and you can\u0027t just shut down in the end, because it\u0027s so surprising. This thriller is really thrilling and doesn\u0027t use any of clich√©s which are so common for this genre. Instead of it Irresistible uses original approaches and is full of beautiful images and realistic behavior of main characters. It\u0027s certainly worth-seeing.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
