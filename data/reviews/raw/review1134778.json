Maybe mostly a movie for girls, but yet a great and excellent movie. Ione Skye plays Frankie, who is about to leave in one week for her acting dreams in L.A., who wants to meet the man with blue eyes. And in comes David, new in town and who happens to be employed in the Caf√© Blue Eyes which Frankie\u0027s uncle Leo runs. It becomes a crazy week together with Frankie\u0027s best friend Allison (Jennifer Aniston), Frankie\u0027s gay cousin and uncle Leo. Fixed by the decision to catch David, Frankie does everything for trying to get David to fall in her... but it is really a hard task as he has a girlfriend. A fine story of love, meaningful quotes, insomnia, dreams and true friendship.
