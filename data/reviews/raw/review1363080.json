This is a really cute, fun, entertaining, and educational show. I said that because I watch this on Nickelodeon and Noggin with my 16-month-old nephew from time to time. It\u0027s hard to say which show on Nickelodeon and Noggin is the best. Still it\u0027s really cute, fun, entertaining, and educational. Before I wrap this up, I\u0027d like to say that the people at Nickelodeon and Noggin really know how to reach a toddler\u0027s developing mind. Now, in conclusion, if you have children, nieces, or nephews, I strongly recommend this really cute, fun, entertaining, and educational show. I guarantee you that they will enjoy it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
