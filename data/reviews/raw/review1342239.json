He recalls when he won the lottery, quited his job and disappointed his best friend. Sayid and Jack explore the shelter trying to find the source of the electromagnetic field. Locke tells Charlie the secret about the shelter. Jin, Sawyer and Michael find that the group that arrested them leaded by Ana Lucia was in the flight 815, and they were twenty three when they crashed the island. Claire finds the bottle with the messages on the beach.\n\nThis episode is good, but the ridiculous attitude of Hurley trying to blow the food store is ridiculous. If the group that arrested the raft castaways is also passengers of the flight 815, who are \"The Others\"? My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): Not Available.\n\nNote: On 26 March 2013, I saw this episode again.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
