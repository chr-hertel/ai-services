Translation: LOTS of subtitle reading. This IS a \"discussion\" film, and the exchanges are important - however, much of their meaning is hidden in the juxtaposition of words vs actions, facial expressions, body language, etc.. so it\u0027s equally visual.\n\nI do wish Roehmer used better production qualities. The look of his film takes on something of a rough documentary appearance - which has great potential - but his are without the total spontaneity of a real document OR the total control of all those populating the frame. I.e., \"extras\" are not controlled well enough to appear unaware of the camera, nor trained enough to act their way through a scene. He needs professional extras.\n\nOkay, THAT aside, the CONTENT of the MAIN POINT is so interesting, sad, maddening, and insightful, THIS is why you stick with it. This woman lives in a huge forest of her own, and can\u0027t seem to spot a single tree. Everyone can relate to this idea through life\u0027s observations - AND direct experience.\n\nFace it. NONE of us manage to know the entire forest by our solo strolls along paths of least resistance." }
