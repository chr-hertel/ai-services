Oh well, at least Jack Warden was convincing. \n\nPredictably dreary directing by Martin Ritt (Hud; Hombre).\n\nBrynner was definitely out of place as the lead, but Georgia native Woodward was right on target.\n\nBritish actress Margaret Leigton was terrific. She\u0027s another reminder that even in the 50\u0027s, some of Hollywood\u0027s best were skinny, chain-smoking women from across the pond. Some things never change, I guess.\n\nThe print I saw on INHD was in excellent shape. I wonder why this hasn\u0027t been released on DVD.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
