What a load of stuff that comes out of the bottom of most mammals. This is a Rambo movie, made with the intension of making money. Its a greedy exploitation of whats really happens in Burma, and you have to be an American to think otherwise. Patriotism my \"you know where.\"\n\nBut its fun exploitation. If you can call anything just that. They did pretty much the same thing in Rambo 2 and 3, the only differences is that the US is not that involved with the Burma conflict, so why do something else now?\n\nIts a mindless blood-feast with the steroid eating killing machine Rambo at the center. Its action, its gory, and most of us liking this kind of stuff will love it.\n\nSly delivers a back to the 80s action packed popcorn fun-ride. Enjoy! :)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
