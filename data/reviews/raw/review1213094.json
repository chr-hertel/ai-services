I was pleasantly surprised. It had its share of low spots, but that is the beauty of watching a first time director\u0027s work, you see them grow. Shonali is going to be a writer director to be reckoned with.\n\nLike all good \u0027Films\u0027 that are based on true events this film walks the fine line of not getting too caught up in the heat of actual events. Instead it tries to dramatize or fictionalize the effects of the events on people lives. A fact that some audience don\u0027t seem to grasp. Especially, a substantial number of Indian audience (amply demonstrated on this site by the stupid review by ajaysaxena1960)! I sat through a Q\u0026A session with the director where people wanted to know why the director did not name names of all the MLA\u0027s involved in the massacre. Or if the director could through her film, get the International tribunal to try Indian government for crimes against humanity. \n\nSHE IS A FILM MAKER. NOT A HISTORIAN OR A CRUSADER.\n\nThe film took 8 years to fund and make (a crusade in itself), for that alone I admire the director. But of all the films done by writers and directors based in America, Shonali\u0027s film most certainly stands head and shoulders above the rest. She has a strong voice and a crisp sense of film-making.\n\nA director most certainly worth watching!" }
