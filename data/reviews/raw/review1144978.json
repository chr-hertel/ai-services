The Bourne films? Fight Club? Leon? If your answers include \"No\", you have no place discussing films on the internet. Go back to the Hallmark channel immediately and never return.\n\nIf your answers include \"I haven\u0027t seen it\", rectify the situation forthwith. IMDb will be here when you are ready to return.\n\nIf your answers are \"Yes, Yes, Yes and good golly Yes again!\", prepare yourself for another film that reaches the cinematic standard of these stylish masterpieces.\n\nUnleashed (as I saw it) starts with gangster Bob and the boys collecting their protection money, with Jet Li (Danny the Dog) trailed around on his leash as a threat, much as you might with a Dobermann or Pit Bull terrier. Those who don\u0027t pay get seven shades of ..something beaten out of their bloody, broken corpses. This is not the purity of Wu Shu Kung Fu, oh no, this is martial arts crossed with no-holds-barred pub fighting: heads smashed, limbs snapped, furniture broken, noses broken, and a great deal of hair removal by fingers alone. Pay up, or pay now and then pay up.\n\nStuff happens (I\u0027m not going to ruin it), and Danny finds himself alone and taken under the wing of blind piano tuner Morgan Freeman (playing \u0027Morgan Freeman\u0027 on full wisdom \u0026 shmaltz settings). By and by, Danny (who\u0027s been raised - and badly treated - like a dog) begins to be rehabilitated and discovers the small joys life can bring. ACTION FANS: this is not a bad thing. Jet Li somehow manages to stay the right side of \u0027cute\u0027, Morgan Freeman manages to express waryness as well as a warm welcome, and thanks to superb sound and directing we get one of the most tense moments I\u0027ve ever seen in any film. I was literally holding my breath, totally tensed up, and thinking \"God no! Don\u0027t do that!!!\". Beware if this Director ever decides to do Horror - it could be so scary he\u0027ll have the audience carried out on stretchers \u0026 oxygen.\n\nAnyway, Danny\u0027s past catches up with him. It always does, usually about two-thirds of the way through a film. And then we\u0027re back to some more serious violence, followed by a brief pause before even more serious violence, a \u0027boss battle\u0027 which reminded me of the albino twins in Kiss of the Dragon, and the inevitable confrontation at the end. There\u0027s some back-story flashbacks \u0026 revelations thrown in too, but not so much as to be annoying. Then the film is over, you walk out of the cinema, and text the mate who couldn\u0027t join you to tell him he missed an INCREDIBLE film, ha ha, and I\u0027ll see it again if you want to go.\n\nSpecial mention for Jet Li - a tour de force, not just in the action scenes but also for his portrayal of a man who has basically been brutalised from a very young age, and is even scared of himself.\n\nSpecial mention for Bob Hoskins - who I\u0027ve not really rated before, but here he manages to flesh out a very convincing, reprehensible character. Great dialogue gives him a verbal dexterity we don\u0027t usually see in our cardboard-cutout villains, as well as a definite emotional connection to Danny (twisted though it is). We\u0027re clearly supposed to see him as one of those dog owners who treats his dog very badly, but still cares for it in his own sick way.\n\nSpecial mention for the director \u0026 editor - for fabulous fight scenes, with LONG CUTS so we can actually see Jet Li\u0027s skill and Yuen Wo Ping\u0027s choreography. Also for maintaining pace and interest through the middle where most filmmakers would die on their butts. Also for creating AMAZING tension (because YES, in real life if you try to rehabilitate/domesticate a wild animal there\u0027s always the threat that it could flip out and kill you without meaning to). Also for perhaps the only film I\u0027ve ever seen with A) car crashes that don\u0027t end in ridiculous explosions and B) characters that survive car crashes AND show signs of injuries! Where is this crazy wave of realism going to end!? We\u0027ll have characters remembering to eat, sleep and go to the toilet next..\n\nI can only think of two minor criticisms: 1) The middle of the film takes place over a few (or several) months - but you don\u0027t get much of a sense of time passing. Like it says in Team America, maybe we needed a montage (\"montage, yeah!\"). 2) There\u0027s quite a big plot point that goes completely unresolved. I can\u0027t explain too much, but essentially I believe a significant \u0027payback\u0027 scene is missing from the final third. The main story doesn\u0027t need it, but I would like to have seen what happened.\n\nUnleashed / Danny the Dog - whatever it\u0027s called, go see it. It\u0027s fab.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
