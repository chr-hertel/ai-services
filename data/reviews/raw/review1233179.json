I was sold with reading the summary on the back of the movie....and then I started to watch it, and I wanted my $3 dollars back. It made no sense that the main characters kept driving through the desert for days upon days without getting anywhere......honestly you can drive an unbelievable distance in a few days. The fake Jack Black/fat Dave Navarro is sooooo annoying I wanted to throw something at the TV. Wow what can I say about those top notch special effects.....you could really tell they had the budget of about 57 dollars. Don\u0027t get me wrong I enjoy bad movies, but this one was frustratingly bad. I loved how Harley was unable to lift the dead body off of him in the car, and the torso in monster man\u0027s house. I almost forgot how bad the plot was, having the girl \"prepare\" Adam during the entire time. All I can say is I want those 90 minutes of my life back.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
