Difference is, the thirties turned out one great movie after another; even the bad movies at least have more style than anything out of the \"Me Decade.\"\n\nThis film is as phony and cold as the system it tries to mock; a nihilistic mess, the actors are miscast, the running time is 45 minutes too long, the ending makes no sense, the whole film is an anti-movie. In fact, it\u0027s anti-everything. The production design is nice, though, but Conrad \"Prince of Darkness\" Hall undermines it with his typically washed-out cinematography. I couldn\u0027t even get more than a little amusement from the coincidental names of Donald Sutherland\u0027s character and a certain TV cartoon character who wouldn\u0027t exist for more than another decade.\n\nRent \"The Bad and the Beautiful\" or \"Sunset Boulevard\" or even \"S.O.B.\" instead. Run screaming for the hills from this train wreck at all costs.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
