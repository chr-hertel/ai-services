He suffers from amnesia and soon his past is about to catch up to him. Predictably he wasn\u0027t a watch repair man is his \"previous life\" but a lethal assassin.\n\nThe amnesia formula has been done many times, most notably with the blockbuster Bourne trilogy taken from Robert Ludlum\u0027s novels, but \"Timebomb\" has its merits. Michael Biehn is a good enough actor to play a convincing human action hero and the plot, while quite routine, delivers suspense and action. The mixing of science fiction into the film is also pretty interesting as it provides a few twists. However, there is enough clich√© here to prevent this film from being anything special. Fans of the genre will enjoy it for what it is, others shouldn\u0027t even care to look. --- 6/10\n\nRated R for violence and profanity. Ages 13+", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
