Watching the two interact has always been a treat.\n\nKen Corday let go of an incredible amount of potential for amazing storytelling when he decided that \"Jack\" had to leave with \"Jennifer\".\n\nDays today is all about the couples. The only time people interact with others is to whine about their significant other, or plot to steal someone elses significant other.\n\nThere is no more warm and loving family or friend interaction for the sake of it, and that is the glue that holds the show together.\n\nI\u0027m saddened to see that a show that I watched from 1965-1992 and then started watching again when Steve and Matt and Mary Beth returned is still going to be so terrible.\n\nIt\u0027s not too late for NBC to fix this, but I\u0027m guessing these pleas will fall on deaf ears.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
