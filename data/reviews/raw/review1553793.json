I mean, it\u0027s a simple enough story, right? Stuff comes alive at night. And it also sounds like it could be fun. The trailers also made it seem like it was pretty funny too, but I sensed like it had \"critic punching bag\" written all over it. Its time came along and its rating showed up on rottentomatoes: 49%. My heart sagged, but fortunately I could still go see it, as I had a gift card that I had received for a birthday present. I went, determined to like it, yet still analyzing enough of it critically to not let it get away with just anything. Night at the Museum turned out to just be harmless fun, not fully realizing its potential yet not completely wasting it either.\n\nWe are introduced to Ben Stiller as Larry Daley, a single dad whose ex-wife is now marrying some annoying, always smiling, over-achiever. Larry, of course, has a son, whom he must impress by finally getting a job. These preliminaries are nothing special, they could even be looked at as mere cheese, but if you just accept everything and go along with it, you\u0027ll find yourself liking the characters. Larry eventually gets a job at the Museum of Natural History as a nightguard. He meets three quirky guards who have the best roles in the film. Comedy legends Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, and Bill Cobbs play the nightguards, and they shine the most and have the most fun with their roles. It is clear these men have had quite a bit of experience with comedy, and their presence only helps the film.\n\nOf course, eventually Larry finds out that everything in the museum comes to life, and he must decide whether to quit or to stay on and attempt to deal with everything himself. Needless to say, he stays on, and the adventure ensues from there. Lots of wild and quirky things happen, and we meet some pretty interesting characters along the way, including Robin Williams as Theodore Roosevelt, Owen Wilson as Jedediah, Ricky Gervais as Mr. Mcphee, the curator, and Steve Coogan as Octavius, a roman general. Robin Williams puts a welcome lid on his usual shtick. Steve Coogan delivers an impressive comedic performance with his tongue firmly in his cheek. Ricky Gervais (creator of the original British Office) is by far the most hilarious of the four, brilliantly pulling off his part. Whenever he was on screen I couldn\u0027t stop laughing. And finally, Owen Wilson is less than stellar - he tries to match Coogan\u0027s performance but falls just a bit short, going too far over the top. All this being said, the biggest problem of the movie lies with Ben Stiller himself.\n\nIn a movie as silly as this, and let\u0027s face it, with no real substance to it, the performance of the lead actor needs to be spot on or the whole movie will simply feel like a vehicle for a big star name. Ben Stiller nearly makes this movie crumble with his performance. He absolutely refuses to overact, wink at the camera, or do any sort of outrageous thing that would have made this movie much more hilarious. It seems he\u0027s just trying to portray a normal guy, and that is not what this movie needed at all. It needed some spice, some life, some invigoration. Ben Stiller succeeds somewhat - his performance grazes with the line just a bit, but not enough to go over into true hilarity. His chemistry with the romantic lead, Carla Gugino, works fairly well. Gugino herself is nothing special.\n\nThis being a special effects movie, if they were anything less than stellar, the entire thing would flop. Fortunately, every special effect is pulled off quite beautifully - the lions look amazingly real, the T-Rex made out of bones fits in nicely with everything else. Excitement is never too high, though there a couple of jumpy moments. There is one particular spot that was annoying, and showed very poor craftsmanship. While Stiller and Gugino are walking along the sidewalk, a microphone drops into the scene. I couldn\u0027t tell whether it was part of the scene or was an accident, but either way, it worked against the movie.\n\nNight at the Museum should not be looked at for anything more than entertainment. If it is, it will fall apart. The story is weak - a plot hole or two could probably be found if one looked carefully enough, the characters who aren\u0027t statues are pretty much cardboard cutouts, the silliness doesn\u0027t reach its full potential, most of the funny lines in the movie can be found in the trailers, and if such excellent comedic actors hadn\u0027t been found, the script would have fallen completely flat. Special effects are good, but so what? Just sit back and enjoy the fun ride that this movie is. Ben Stiller, despite his faults, is reasonably good, and the story is just deep enough to get us involved. Besides, let\u0027s face it - it\u0027s all about the statues.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
