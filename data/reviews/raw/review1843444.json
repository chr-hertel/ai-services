Why stunned? Because if you asked me to say some words about this movie I probably wouldn\u0027t know. This movie is one of the rare movies that really got me speechless...\n\nbut all I\u0027m gonna say is that it takes a lot of imagination to combine music with such a moving story... wow. I enjoy watching music films but this is something out of the ordinary... it\u0027s... SPECIAL... :) \n\nI loved every song in this movie especially the one they sing in the church, I think it\u0027s called \"Rise me up\" or something like that. \n\nAnyway, just wanted to say I loved it very much and I recommend it to everyone! \n\nKainolos", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
