Is it bad? Huh? Huh?\n\nTHE GOOD: They\u0027ve managed not pump it up with the usual toxic drama and cheap bashing - it has a fine dosage which will save you all the \"Oh come on!\" and the usual exclamations of boredom from the people in the audience. Also Edward Norton seems a better choice than the last guy tough many people hate a to see a sequel with a new cast. So at least you won\u0027t regret watching it unless you are an edgy critic. And its better to see it than gamble for another movie of the season.\n\nTHE BAD: Its not much content to start with, but thats probably because the comic doesn\u0027t really offer much movie material to work with. To make comic live on screen you need some seriously profound storytelling abilities, and I\u0027m afraid the The Incredible Hulk (2008) isn\u0027t a break from the usual weak comic movies. Liv Tyler seems like a bad choice, it may be just me but i think that she uses the same look on her face in one too many movies and it ain\u0027t all that convincing any more. There were no little sugar cubes in the form of elements bringing grace to scenes. The plot aside, there\u0027s always infinite possibility for turning a plain old story into a remarkable experience but it seems nobody tries now days.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: If you want to see something with sensibly less of the usual cheap drama, profanity and lethally boring dialog you might wanna try the Hulk, with a bit of luck you might be fan of the green bag of muscles and enjoy your self without looking for special experience. But if you put that on the scales against going out with your friends on some other activity the movie should take a rain check.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
