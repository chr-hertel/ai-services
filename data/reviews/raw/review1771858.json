The style and storytelling is obviously the same. I don\u0027t mind this, since it\u0027s an excellent and above all very entertaining style of film-making. Obviously it\u0027s not as good as a Guy Ritchie movie of the same style but it\u0027s surely entertaining enough.\n\nIt\u0027s not as good since the comedy in the movie feels more forced and planned out, rather than that it\u0027s cleverly and subtle written throughout the story. The events happen as comical moments rather than just moments that happen to the main characters. But of course you should perhaps not compare this too much to a Guy Ritchie and more regard it as a movie on its own. After all, it\u0027s Irish and therefor has a totally different atmosphere and lingo as well. In that regard this movie is just simply a well made and definitely entertaining one.\n\nBut was dog racing the best backdrop and choice for the main story? I don\u0027t think so. Some sports are not really sports in my opinion and therefor couldn\u0027t care any less about the movie its plot. I also couldn\u0027t care too much for the movie it\u0027s main characters. The actors portraying them are obviously not amongst the most talented, though they do a fair enough job playing average, regular \u0027normal\u0027 persons.\n\nSo it\u0027s definitely a movie with some pluses and minuses. The style and fun in this movie is definitely good and makes this an enjoyable watch. I only wished the movie had picked another main-plot, to also make the movie more compelling and interesting and perhaps even a bit more exciting to watch. After all, with these kinds of movies involving \u0027sports\u0027 featuring an underdog, you already exactly know in advance how it\u0027s going to end.\n\nA pleasant watch but unfortunately no more than that. \n\n6/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
