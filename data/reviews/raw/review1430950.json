I haven\u0027t seen every episode, but I still enjoy it. It\u0027s hard to say which episode is my favorite. However, I think it\u0027s always funny when a mishap occurs. I always laugh at that. It\u0027s nice that every main character has stayed with the show throughout its entire run so far. It seems that no one stays with a show throughout its entire run. Everyone always gives a good performance, the setting is spectacular, everything about the characters is well-done, and the writing is always very strong. In conclusion, I hope this show will always live on in syndication once it finishes its run on FOX.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
