It\u0027s basically the flipside of \"Dazed and Confused\", where youthful hedonism has been replaced by 20-something boredom. It\u0027s a post-college movie where characters have found themselves unfulfilled in every capacity. It\u0027s a pack mentality, where you hang-out with the same gang from high school only to find you\u0027ve out grown each other and resent one another\u0027s ambitions because you know you yourself lack the impetus to do anything constructive with your life. These characters are losers in every respect, clinging on to their high school way of life, reluctant to take initiative and move on. They constantly put each other down, bicker and make efforts to humiliate, yet the depressing thing is they have no one but each other. This is a quality film that remains one of Linklater\u0027s most under appreciated efforts. No one has the ability to present young characters with the insight, skill and craft Lanklater possesses. He is truly one of America\u0027s finest filmmakers working today and \"SubUrbia\" is a great film that still holds up.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
