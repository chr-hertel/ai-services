Best actor: Yoda.", "reviewBody": "In my childhood, Star Wars was great. Episode IV through VI, I loved it. And of course I had to see the other Episodes. What a disappointment. The original Episodes dared and were a bit like child\u0027s play, like fairy tales in space. This was their charms. On the prequels, there were too much expectations, and Lucas - despite his power and money - didn\u0027t dare to frustrate any of them. But if all you get is expected, it gets more or less boring. \n\nOK, the political aspect is good - how a democracy gets destroyed and replaced by a de-facto dictatorship: by creating an external threat, and then claiming you need more power and reduce citizens rights in order to fight that threat. This has worked since Caesar made himself dictator and his name became a title to his successors, and may work in all galaxies, even those far, far away. But it isn\u0027t news. At least it shouldn\u0027t be if you are a grown-up citizen of a democracy. Thanks, Mr. Lucas, for teaching the children. Oh, and yes: Hate, jealousy and greed lead to the dark side. They always have. Thanks for telling us again.\n\nThat was basically the best of content you get; the rest of the script is the very expected but coarsely explained (and acted) transformation of a jedi adept to a sith lord, some blah blah, and lots of fighting.\n\nAbout the fighting sequences: technically, they are top. But dramatically, they are boring. Dead boring. Lucas never mastered the art of suspension, and it really shows - the faster the swords go, the larger the battles and the faster the cuts are, the less the viewer gets to participate emotionally. And if you don\u0027t really care for any of the characters on screen, it\u0027s just eye candy and then its over.\n\nI didn\u0027t expect differently, so that\u0027s OK. What really annoyed me is Lucas\u0027 puritan perspective. Don\u0027t get me wrong - I don\u0027t want to see Padme and Anakin having sex on screen, thank you very much! But the characters are just puppets, not people. Nobody really eats, drinks, sleeps, bleeds; even the dirt looks polished. The places don\u0027t look like people ever have to cook, go to the toilet, or sleep for longer than the next cut. And the \"love\" story looks like a pre-puberty child imitating love stories it has seen with barbie and ken. Suspension of belief is perfectly OK for SciFi, but its different from \"unrealistic\".\n\nOne more nag: the names are just hilarious. I read in an article somewhere, \"Mace Windu sounds like something you spray on colicky babies\". Exactly, and there are more cases of bad design. Grievous is not scary, just awkward. I could go on for many more lines. Anyways.\n\nThe best acting was Yodas (or Frank Oz\u0027?), probably because he got the best role - Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson and Nathalie Portman aren\u0027t bad, but the script just didn\u0027t give them any chance to show it. At least McGregor managed to get his screen presence and some charm across.\n\nConclusion: If you are a true SW fan, enjoy it. If you want your movies to have suspension or sense, avoid it. I don\u0027t really regret having spent the time and money, but others might.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
