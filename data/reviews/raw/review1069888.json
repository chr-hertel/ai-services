I\u0027m not a fan of ballet, but even I was thrilled by the performances in this film and moved by the beauty of dance. What Altman has done here is use one art form to record the artistic process of another, and it\u0027s mostly successful on those terms. I have to admit that my attention did wander at times. I didn\u0027t want a contrived plot and was happy just watching artists at work, but even I was craving some dramatic conflict here and there. I have to think there\u0027s more drama in the behind-the-scenes world of professional dance (just as there is when any group of people come together in a community) than Altman finds here. But the visuals are superb, especially the cinematography. And, being from Chicago myself, it was fun to soak in the Windy City locations (I could have been an extra in the outdoor scene they filmed in Grant Park, but wasn\u0027t able to go to the shoot).\n\nThere\u0027s really no need to mention the actors, since none of them really registers, with the exception of Malcolm McDowell, who breezes on and off the screen wearing a yellow scarf around his neck and barking tyrannical orders to have furniture moved out of his way. No, the star of this show is the dance itself. It\u0027s not one of Altman\u0027s best films, but he\u0027s certainly done much, much worse.\n\nGrade: B", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
