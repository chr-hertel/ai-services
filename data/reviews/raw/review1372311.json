Truly a BIG sign that the scary movie franchise is dead or dying. This coming from a huge fan of the scary movie franchise, i thought the first 2 were comic gems and the third one was a nice surprise, but this one just took all the jokes from the last one and just churned them out again. Of course there was celebrity cameos, but about 75% of them didn\u0027t need to be in there (ie. Lil Jon, Michael Madsen, Mike Tyson) they were just there to get a small part in a big movie and a paycheck. The jokes were all done before in the first 3, the Michael Jackson thing has been done to death. The only good scenes were the \u0027Brokeback\u0027 scene, \u0027Tom Cruise\u0027 couch jumping scene, and Leslie Nielson. The other jokes you could see coming a mile away and weren\u0027t that funny, just stupid or gross. I feel bad for Ana Farris, she has been type cast like crazy and I don\u0027t see her career going anywhere but to these spoof comedies that are getting worse and worse. this review is coming from a guy that loves spoof comedies, but this was just not good at all, average is the best word for it. If you saw the trailer, then you saw the best parts of the movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
