You can say that this movie is more of the same, since it doesn\u0027t offer anything new really but its welcomed, since its basically some good entertainment. It\u0027s definitely way better than your average B-monster movie attempt. It remains rather amusing to see a 60 feet man causing mayhem, no matter how simple and ridicules it sounds. Of course the movie gets rather ridicules at times, also with its characters and dialogs but what else could be expected from a movie like this.\n\nThe first movie still sort of picked a more emotional monster approach, in the same way as for instance was the case with classic monster movies such as \"Frankenstein\" and \"The Wolf Man\". This movie still somewhat has a \u0027realistic\u0027 approach feeling over it but the emotional elements involving the main character are pretty much gone by now because of the reason that the condition of him has influenced his brain, as already was the case at the ending of the first movie, causing him to be more of a growling monster this time.\n\nThe movie is directed by the same director (Bert I. Gordon) of the first movie but yet the movie does not use the same actors. Sort of makes you wonder why, as if the actors from the first movie were classy actors who were in the position the make demands and ask for an high salary. It\u0027s not a big issue though that the actors are different ones this time, even though its definitely true that the acting in this movie is worse than was the case in the first movie.\n\nThe special effects are just as effective looking as they already were in the first movie. Of course it doesn\u0027t look like much special by todays standards but back in the \u002750\u0027s this must have really scared some people and must have been amazed by some of the movie its effects. Even now the movie still remains sort of somewhat scary at times because of the make-up effects and growls of the amazing colossal man, or beast as this movie its title calls him. It\u0027s definitely more of an horror movie than the first movie was, that mainly picked a science-fiction approach.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t feature as much action as the movie its title might suggest and actually when you compare this movie to the first one, you\u0027ll see that both actually feature just as much action. This might be a disappointing aspect, since the movie its title obviously suggest some bigger, better action. Oh well, of course back in the \u002750\u0027s they just didn\u0027t had a good idea yet of how to create an action filled summer blockbuster.\n\nMore of the same but therefor also just as good and watchable as the first movie.\n\n6/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
