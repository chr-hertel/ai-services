The casting is spot on, one of the major differences to the sequel. Bruce Willis is a great choice to play the voice of Mikey, and John Travolta is fantastic. But for me it was George Segal who stole the show for me, playing Mikey\u0027s real father, who in his words is going through a \u0027selfish phase\u0027.\n\nSadly the sequels are simply terrible, but this movie is one of the best comedies I\u0027ve seen in a long time, and I gave it 8/10.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
