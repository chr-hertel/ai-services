A movie I can actually see with my children and grandchildren without worry. No profanity, no sex scenes. Hollywood take note, great movies are not dependent on shock value. A good story with great acting is what Invincible is all about, and by adding a wonderful moral and lesson of hope makes it an outstanding movie. I would see this movie again. My only complaint is that it ended too soon. Its the best movie of the season. Mark W. played the role of his lifetime, I hope \"Oscar\" is in his future for this one. It was a punishing role physically, and emotionally it had to be a challenge, and he pulled it off with great success.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
