The mixture of mystery/drama/science fiction is excellent as well as the characters. It reminds me of William Johnston\u0027s book series \"The Ashes\" with the doomsday theme. Skeet Ulrich\u0027s character is suspenseful because no one knows where he\u0027s been or what he\u0027s done for the last 5 years, yet he\u0027s able to save a little girl on the bus and then kill one of the convicts his first day back! The way they ended the second show with the former policeman putting red pins on cities that were nuked and not showing where he put all the pins leaves you in suspense! Keep up the great job and don\u0027t cancel this show!!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
