A lot of people complained that Nicholas Cage didn\u0027t die. How can there be a movie if the main character dies? He could have been in less dangerous places but who wants to see that? And if you want to learn about the Windtalkers and World War Two than you probably shouldn\u0027t have rented a movie starring Nicholas Cage and Adam Beach. I\u0027m glad that it wasn\u0027t a story about Windtalkers and World War Two. I got to school to learn about those things. I rented this movie to see some action and be entertained, not learn a lesson on history. I don\u0027t see why everyone hates this movie so much. It might not have been true to the actual events but I wasn\u0027t expecting it to be and I liked it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
