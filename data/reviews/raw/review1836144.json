The plot was a bit contrived and predictable, but we knew going into it it wasn\u0027t going to be super cerebral! But, the addition of Alexis Dziema as Gemma, Donald Sutherland\u0027s daughter, was HORRIBLE!! A little bit of her would have sufficed; a lot of her was simply irritating beyond belief! I thought she was a 13 yr old child, with her squeaky, annoying voice! Her character got far too much attention, making me wonder WHY?? since it seemed awkward and forced! And, then, the writers/directors/producers decide to add in the lovely part about the sword landing between bikini-clad, spread-eagled legs that I felt was rude, crude, and something only 12 yr old boys would find humorous and entertaining!! When \u0027Gemma\u0027 entered the scene, the movie was ruined for me!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
