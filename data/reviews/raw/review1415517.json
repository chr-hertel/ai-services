I mean to me there wasn\u0027t any difference in watching this movie \"Krrish\" compared to any other English superhero movie(eg:-Superman, Spiderman, Batman etc.)I am very glad that India has finally done it, they have made a movie which could be really compared to any good movie in here. The use of sci-fi is first time introduced in Indian cinema and I will be very happy if they continue to produce a good movie like this. This is the best movie of the year. And I am really dying to watch the next sequel of this movie. Its a 10/10.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
