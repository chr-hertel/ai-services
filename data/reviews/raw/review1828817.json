This was my second time seeing this film and I didn\u0027t care for it as much this time but it was still a solid thriller with a few magic touches from the director. I\u0027ve said it before but I feel Hitchcock lost a lot after Psycho but this film, while flawed, manages to have a few classic moments including the infamous potato sack scene and the first rape/murder sequence, which manages to be quite suspenseful. Finch is terrific in his role as is Alec McCowen as the inspector who keeps getting junk to eat. Barry Foster steals the show as the psychopath. Overall, the film manages to worth well but it\u0027s a little too choppy for its own good and coming from Hitchcock a good thriller just isn\u0027t good enough." }
