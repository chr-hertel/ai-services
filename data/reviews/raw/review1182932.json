I went to see this movie last night, I never knew anything about it, and I\u0027m glad I didn\u0027t since I hate watching trailers, and listening/reading to others opinions on a movie before I see it.\n\nThis movie isn\u0027t your typical gangster movie, it\u0027s more of a psychological movie. Great storyline. Some of you might predict what happens, but personally I force myself not to think what could happen in the movie, I think it ruins the whole experience.\n\nThe acting is excellent. Probably the best acting I\u0027ve seen from Jason Stratham yet. And the performances by Ray Liotta, Andre Benjamin and Vincent Pastore were superb, as were the rest of the actors.\n\nOverall the movie is brilliant, I\u0027d definitely recommend this movie to anyone, if you get the chance it\u0027s worth a watch!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
