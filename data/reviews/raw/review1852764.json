The fact that it was helmed by a first time director with no previous film experience did not help me in formulating my preconception. Boy was I wrong! Ocean of Pearls is a moving and ultimately redeeming spiritual voyage that intelligently touched upon such topics as faith, assimilation, materialism, family and HMOs in modern secular America, while telling the story of a young Sikh-Canadian doctor who loses his faith in his religion and profession when taking on new job at a private Detroit hospital. Its not as profound (or heady) as an Ingmar Bergman film (and is not intended to be), but for a family drama it carries great weight and is a refreshingly honest portrayal of South Asians in North America.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
