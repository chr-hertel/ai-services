It is what you would expect from the people involved in this movie, all the way to Ben Stiller helping produce the movie. A lot of good one liners are in this movie as well as a lot of physical comedy. I liked it a lot. Anyone who goes to see this will not be disappointed. There are a lot of Ferrell and Heder haters out there, and that is fine, but then just don\u0027t go see this movie then because you probably do not have a sense of humor and wont get the jokes anyway. I hope anyone else who goes to see it enjoys its comedy, and i do think that most people who are going to see this movie know exactly what to expect.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
