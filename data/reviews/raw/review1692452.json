Aside from that I have enjoyed watching this film at least a dozen times - always catching subtitles I missed before. It was akin to looking at an exquisite painting again and again - gathering more appreciation each time. All performances were excellent but Maggie Smith\u0027s reaction to the cup of coffee being dumped into the lap of Weismann\u0027s valet was priceless. Best scene: between Helen Mirrin and Eileen Atkins toward end of film, in Mrs. Wilson\u0027s bedroom where she confronts the ultimate loss of her son. Helen\u0027s performance went right through the ceiling for me - what a treat. Lance Hauser", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
