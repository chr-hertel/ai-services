He must have been grateful to get back to RKO studios and to do one of the best noir films ever done.\n\nMitchum plays the luckless Jeff Bailey, private eye who has the ill fortune to fall under the feminine charms of Jane Greer after gambler/racketeer Kirk Douglas hires him to find her and $40,000.00 she stole from him after shooting him. Mitchum trails her to Mexico, but when he meets her, let\u0027s just say he easily sees why Kirk Douglas wants her back so bad. It\u0027s one piece of intrigue after another at this point until there\u0027s tragedy all around.\n\nThis was Kirk Douglas\u0027s second picture and he showed his range as a player after playing a weakling in his debut film, The Strange Loves of Martha Ivers. Douglas and Mitchum got good notices, but this film really belongs to Jane Greer. The sheer scope of this woman\u0027s evil will leave you gasping. Out of the Past gave Jane Greer her career role and she made the most of it. Two of post World War II Hollywood\u0027s biggest leading men and several others in tow. It\u0027s breathtaking when you think of it.\n\nOut of the Past is a real downer of a film, but mesmerizing as a study of how a man can get hooked on feminine charms applied right.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
