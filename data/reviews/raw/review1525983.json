He moves to the house of an undertaker, but after an unfair severe spank, he starts a seven day runaway to London. He arrives exhausted and starving, and is welcomed by a gang of pickpockets leaded by the old crook Fagin (Ben Kingsley). When he is mistakenly taken as a thief, the wealthy victim Mr. Brownlow (Edward Hardwick) brings Oliver to his home and shelters him. But Fagin and the dangerous Bill Sykes (Jamie Foreman) decide to kidnap Oliver to burglarize Mr. Brownlow\u0027s fancy house. Oliver is wounded, while Mr. Brownlow tries to save Oliver.\n\nRoman Polanski\u0027s version of Oliver Twist is another great adaptation of the classic Charles Dickens novel. The careful production tells the beautiful story using an excellent cast (I did not recognize Ben Kingsley) and the landscapes, scenarios and costumes are amazing. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Oliver Twist\"", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
