Beginning in story mode, you have to train yourself to get stronger and face bigger, better fighters. During the long adventure, you\u0027ll start to build fame and gain a good reputation. At the end, those who hated you will have joined your side. To me, the ending feels sad because you started off unknown to the community and you\u0027ve now became the true warrior- forever, with a well known standing name. Your once enemies are now your troops.\n\nHowever, I think the producers lacked on the ending. So much movie clips in the beginning and so little in the end.\n\nGraphics- Very clean and smooth. Frame skip is excellent and rarely any slowdowns.\n\nSound- Ouch! Do you hear all that bone-crunching and snapping? High quality sound effects makes you feel it! \n\nMusic- Sadly 25 artist tracks in the game.\n\nGameplay- Challenging to learn. That\u0027s why there\u0027s a gym to train you to become a pro in no time.\n\nReplay value- Very high. If you love hip hop artists and movie stars and like to see them fight one-on-one, Def Jam is very fun to play. Over 30 characters and lots of stages to choose from. Some stages got rules like- Ring out, subway match, burn \u0027em and window match. Can\u0027t go bored.\n\nOverall rating- 8/10." }
