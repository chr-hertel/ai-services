But none the less it\u0027s a great superhero movie! The beginning starts out with kind of the same feel as the first movie a few jokes here and there, okay there are plenty of jokes, but near the middle and end it has a darker better feel to it, besides the jokes some of the ending reminded me of X2: Xmen United. Despite it\u0027s run time it\u0027s a great superhero film and one of Marvel\u0027s most enjoyable films of all time! The film did much better than I thought it would with it\u0027s great CGI, Great action, and a great plot. I definitely recommend you to go and see this at you nearest theater and I\u0027m definitely gonna get the DVD when it comes out. I was unsure if Tim Story could pull it off but somehow he did. I give this film a 10 out of 10 for being an excellent movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
