Not only must Holmes have to keep an eye out for the Nazis but the biggest problem might be the trader Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atwill). This is a pretty thrilling adventure for the series and manages to have a great ending, which has some nice tension as Holmes is slowly having the blood drained from his body while the police and Watson try to find his location. Once again the screenplay, dealing with the German\u0027s wanting to find a scientist, isn\u0027t very original but it\u0027s fun enough to keep the film moving well for its short running time. Rathbone once again turns in a very strong performance as Holmes and his charm and wit are on full display and mixes well with Bruce\u0027s sometimes dimwitted Dr. Watson. A great bonus is having someone like Atwill playing the bad guy. Both Atwill and Rathbone don\u0027t miss a step in their banter towards one another, which they did greatly four years earlier in Son of Frankenstein. Roy William Neill was a very underrated director and he does a fine job here at keeping the film moving at a very fast pace and he nicely adds up the tension towards the end." }
