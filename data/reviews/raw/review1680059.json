I\u0027m guessing they had a whopping budget of $50,000 to work with and wound up with $40,000 left over.\n\nI\u0027ve seen better acting in high-school drama class plays, and heard better dialog in a Pamprin commercial. Kerol Rae as \"Renee Dupa\" was particularly bad. A pretty face, but she\u0027s pretty obviously got the IQ of a lizard. She IS very adept at keeping her body covered up, however, and even manages to snatch a towel while being attacked by a knife-man in the shower to be sure that none of her assets are exposed.\n\nWalter Baziak as Ike, possibly the poorest cast lead character I\u0027ve ever seen, displays all the emotion of a Chia pet when \"comforting\" her after she miraculously survives the attack. Toss in the dream sequence of his poorly-choreographed shootout from the beginning of the movie, oh, a dozen times or so, to give the movie some length, because it dang sure doesn\u0027t have any PLOT.\n\nDo yourself a favor. Drag a chair out into the front yard, grab a bowl of popcorn, and watch the grass grow. It\u0027ll be more exciting.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
