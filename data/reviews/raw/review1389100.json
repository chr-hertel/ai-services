This movie is proof that a REMAKE is not always a bad thing after all.\n\nThe new fast zombie add to the already freaky nature of a corpse coming at you intent on taking a chunk out of you.\n\nThe new mall is smaller than the one in the classic... this with great lighting make the film more claustrophobic.\n\nThe actors are great in this film too... with more people, and less running time they actors did well to carve out a good part for the film.\n\nThe Johnny Cash song \"When the Man Comes Around\" at opening credits of just how fast the world can fall apart was great.\n\nEnjoy the show." }
