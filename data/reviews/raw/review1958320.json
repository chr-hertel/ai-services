What a dreadful waste of time watching this film proved to be. I kept with it, hoping it would improve. I found it draggy, dull, dark and dismal. A sleazy story with totally unnecessary graphic scenes. For example, I think we can all realize that fellatio is in progress when we see a woman\u0027s head bobbing up and down between a man\u0027s thighs as she kneels in front of him. Was there a need then to show two closeup scenes of the man\u0027s organ in her mouth (or was it a prosthesis?). Anyway, unnecessary and disgusting for a mainstream film.\n\nI guessed who the killer was very quickly, no real brain power needed there. Meg Ryan played the part as well as could be expected, considering the awful script. She was virtually unrecognizable from her earlier films, must have had extensive facial surgery I imagine.\n\nOverall, I found nothing of value in this movie. The nude scenes were gratuitous, apparently put in to show that Meg Ryan was entering a new stage as a leading Hollywood actress. No wonder that the English interviewer Parkinson (whom I dislike intently) took a nasty attitude towards her. I have no idea what Meg Ryan is like as a person, but as an actress, she ought not to have taken this ratty part.\n\nI can recommend this flick only to hard-hat serial killer or Meg Ryan fans.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
