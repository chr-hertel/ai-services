Not one of the actors was off the mark and every gag was amusing if not belly laugh provoking! Stiller really hit a home run with his script and every aspect of the acting was excellent! I am not a huge fan of Jack Black and up until now have considered him a very one dimensional actor, but in this film he showed a range of comedic ability which impressed the crap out of me.\n\nThis is without question the BEST comedy I have seen in a very long time! Way to go guys!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
