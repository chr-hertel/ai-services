The TV theme song was by Genesis, the 1983 song \"Just a Job I Do.\" Even using Phil Collins vocals, \"The Insiders\" bit \"Miami Vice\" really, really hard. So at least up to that point, it was \"Miami Vice-lite.\" Was there a cancelled TV show with a jheri-curled dude that wasn\u0027t Stoney Jackson? Seriously. While the show wasn\u0027t on TV that long it was entertaining in a stupid way. If it had come out today it would probably do OK on TBS or the CW. What the show lacked was a strong fashion sense like Miami Vice. It\u0027s like they bit off the most generic parts of Michael Mann\u0027s masterpiece - black guy, white guy - the substance, without taking the style. Mistake.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
