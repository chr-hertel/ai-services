There\u0027s no question in my mind that people who like horror films won\u0027t like this very much because it\u0027s NOT a horror film! I would definitely put it in the suspense genre along with films like Open Water and (and I\u0027m not sure THIS is a good thing) The Blair Witch Project. One could even make the argument that it\u0027s more similar to Deliverence than it is to films in the horror/slasher genre. If you want gore and guts, this isn\u0027t your movie but if you like a suspenseful film with a questionable amount of \"true-ness\" in its \"based on a true story\" than you should like this.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
