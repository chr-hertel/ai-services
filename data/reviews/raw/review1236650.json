As a native Swede, I understand that a lot of foreigners might not fully understand all the singing and weird giggling. But as a story the old movie/TV-series is definitely a good way of telling how things where in the old days in Sweden.\n\nI\u0027m not fond at all of the new recordings, because it spoils the feeling of the dirt-roads and everything to it. Maybe todays kids wouldn\u0027t appreciate it since it don\u0027t contain tons of flash and monsters or anime characters. yet I won\u0027t let my children grow up without seeing this part of my history and background.\n\nAll the characters are well thought through. And having Astrid and Lisa as the storytellers it gives the movie/TV-series a special feeling because of the language. It\u0027s a part of Astrids life and up growth. Even if it\u0027s just about \"everyday life\" for some kids. It\u0027s still about friendship and a good way of seeing things through the eyes of a child.\n\nI haven\u0027t seen the English version. and I doubt I ever will. for me, Astrid Lindgrens books and movies and TV-series are supposed to be in Swedish. It\u0027s the old recordings with the original actors that\u0027s \"it\". all those new recording that\u0027s been done lately can never re-tell the story the way Astrid did. Because no one knew the stories the way she did.\n\nstill, I easily recommend you to see Barnen I Bullerbyn, if not because it\u0027s a classic, then just to see how the old Sweden was, before it became to modern.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
