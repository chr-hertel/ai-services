Both are pretty much the same story word for word and scene for scene. Well, actually, the TV version has an additional scene of the birth of Amos\u0027 child Arbadella (Patti Marie Ellis) who nine years later wants a talking doll for Christmas. Her uncle Andy, despite being broke, resolves to get it for her by becoming a Santa\u0027s helper in the Globe department store. There he encounters kids both kind and bratty. I\u0027ll stop there and mention that Alvin Childress as Amos really shines here especially when he explains to daughter Arbadella what \"The Lord\u0027s Prayer\" really means. Andy himself is more of a sympathetic character here then his usual more slightly naive portrayal. Both Lightnin\u0027 and Kingfish provide their own brief amusements. All in all, both the radio and TV version of \"The Christmas Story\" are very worthy tales for the holiday season. By the way, the Paul Taylor Chrous provided the \"The Lord\u0027s Prayer\" song and \"Silent Night\" on the radio version from December 22, 1944. And I have to mention that Charles Correll-who played Andy on radio-died in my birthtown of Chicago, Illinois on September 26, 1972. Also Amos\u0027 wife Ruby (Jane Adams) was added for the TV version.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
