The original film however outclasses the remake in heart and soul. I will admit that Il Postino looks great, but there is something so genuine about the original, like your first love. Most importantly, the film was produced while Skarmeta was in exile in Germany (the film\u0027s location was Portugal) after the overthrow of Salavador Allende\u0027s government in Chile. Skarmeta, like many of Chile\u0027s artistic and literary community, fled the country after Pinochet\u0027s rise to power. Thus the film\u0027s title, translating into \"Burning Patience,\" is a love story not only of a man for a woman, but the love for a country from which one is separated and the wait people have for justice. \n\nIronically, Skarmeta is now the Chilean Ambassador to Germany.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
