And at the same time, some animal-right activists terrorize the local coat-shop and causes great damage to Proffens mother in their escape.\n\nThe blue wolves does captures the relationship between Pelles family-members well, but lacks some of the intense feelings we saw in \"Døden på Olso S\". The acting is fair, but the story is not that exciting as the family situation occupies most of the story. But both the characters and the scenes still have their charms.\n\nIt is better than \"Giftige Løgner\" but not as god as \"Døden på Oslo S\" So watch it and the Pelle and Proffen trilogy is complete", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
