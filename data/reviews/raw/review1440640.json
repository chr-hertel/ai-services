I mean, you have fish walking around in cop uniforms and it\u0027s on another planet and is it funny bad or bad funny and is it on purpose or is it really that bad? The fish thing really threw me. I mean, walking, talking cop fish. What is that? It\u0027s a joke, right? Or are they serious? That\u0027s what I didn\u0027t get. Maybe I\u0027m an idiot. Or maybe they\u0027re the idiots. I don\u0027t know. I was shocked--shocked!--to see 007 director John Glen was at the helm of this thing. I mean, really, after getting booted from Bond this is what he turns to? Walking, talking cop fish in outer space? Granted, that Christopher Columbus film is no classic, but you\u0027d think he\u0027d have gotten better offers than this. I actually only saw one episode and picked it up halfway through, so I really don\u0027t know what I\u0027m talking about. Maybe it\u0027s an unsung classic. But it sure didn\u0027t seem like it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
