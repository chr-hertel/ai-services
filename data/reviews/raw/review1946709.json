But After that, the film picks up with some very good acting for a NICK film. Nathan Kress shines as Roland and Chris Meloni(If i spelt that right) does a good job doing a comedic role.\n\nAll i can really say is, once the film ends, you won\u0027t be mad you watched it(can\u0027t say the same about some nick movies). Its a good film, not amazing, but not awful either, its good.\n\nNick is starting to pick up well, and Nathan Kress is a rising star that has a great career ahead of him.\n\n9/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
