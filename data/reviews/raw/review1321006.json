I agree that there could have been a much better musical score, however, this film tickled my imagination when I first saw it in 1980; not just about how it could have been a better film, but simply by the fact that slavery, and a slave trade, continues to exist: a fact later confirmed and documented by activists as recently as 2001. As this film was originally released in 1979, I wonder how much of a budget the film would have had it been made more recently, in light of current knowledge about this phenomenon. I have ordered this film to be included in my collection. Some films\u0027 impact is only realized over time, perhaps with repeat viewings, or some time after viewing to consider their whole; some have their greatest impact upon first or second viewing, with subsequent consideration or viewing either reducing said impact, or by that impact\u0027s simply not continuing to swell. This is a film that, while it didn\u0027t continue to grow in significance for me, neither did its significance decline. It could certainly have been better, and it\u0027s unfortunate that Michael Caine, an actor whose work I largely admire, wasn\u0027t happy to have worked on this film, but I do believe that it is much better than many other b- films to be found.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
