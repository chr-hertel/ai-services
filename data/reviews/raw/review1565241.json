Maybe it was just a post-revolution/post-colonial China because he could not even tell a story about a \"generic\" China: In Hero he threw some Chinese cultural symbols together and tried to feed the world that stew, or just collage, as China (to rival Ang Li\u0027s well-digested and portrayed conflicts between Chinese philosophies in CTHD). Beyond that he\u0027s in control of nothing. He is so desperate on his way to master-hood, but his way of movie-making is just going to render him a half-cooked decoy.\n\nA professor in Beijing Hao Jian said Zhang had always been revealing an addiction to the collective unconsciousness of the cultural-revolution generation. He used to make movies based on some good stories about the post-colonial, revolutionary, or post-revolutionary attrition to the Chinese society. He or the generation he represented went through all those but could not grow beyond that. When the suppressed anger had been let out, trauma been told with a succession of international recognition, Zhang is now left with nothing much besides his constant pursuit of FORM, which has been translated to the Zhang-styled pretty and eye-popping-ness, his detailed imaginations of fabricated rituals, and the dwindling of individuals commensurate with the growing size of budget.\n\nProfessor Hao mentioned this and I totally agree: There is no escaping from things such as imperial rituals or authority worship for Zhang\u0027s generation, even though they started as cultural rebels against the system to start with. When finally and comfortably accepted and incorporated not just by the film industry but also the nationalist frame set, they resorted to the kind of discourse they knew and learned about story-telling when they were young in a red guard age. In a Chinese writing class 2 or 3 decades ago, kids were given topics, a central idea to be plugged in,told how to paragraph, and went on with fabrication with a recognized \"safe\" boundary.\n\nMaybe only successful film directors are privileged to live in their puberty dreams.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
