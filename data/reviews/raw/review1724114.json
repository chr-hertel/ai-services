I saw it while a film student at NYU. The film showed a clever beginning to more-than-one career, including being Danny DeVito\u0027s first film. It was totally fun.\n\nThe subtlety of DeVito\u0027s reaction shots and the sheet physicality of how he carries himself in the film were clues to what his future life-in-film would be. DeVito was able then as he is now to play comedy in a tragic setting were impressive. He also managed to be likable, despite some of the things we was cooking up in the film.\n\nThough it is a short film, it deserves a retrospective and/or some type of visibility on the Web. I hope there is a way people can watch it in the future!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
