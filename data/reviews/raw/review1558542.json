The plot feels very random and cobbled together. The villains chuck all kinds of obstacles into Superman\u0027s path - including a weather-manipulating satellite, artificially engineered Kryponite, oodles of missiles, and a malicious supercomputer - but most of these threats are underdeveloped, impersonal and dull.\n\nThe only sort-of-interesting sequence involves Superman splitting into \"good\" and \"evil\" doubles, who get in a fistfight in a junkyard. It\u0027s a somewhat surreal and effective bit of spectacle. But, on the other hand, the scene doesn\u0027t make much sense, and since it\u0027s merely a fight it can\u0027t really qualify as an intelligent exploration of the character\u0027s duality.\n\nRichard Pryor, meanwhile, fails to make any kind of impression whatsoever. He\u0027s amusing in some scenes, but on the whole his jokes - and the movie\u0027s overall sense of humor - come across as dated and \"precious\" (read: annoying). Take, for example, the scene when Pryor slings a tablecloth around his shoulders like a \"cape\" and tries to imitate Superman. It ain\u0027t funny, it just looks stupid.\n\nThe special effects are another disappointing aspect. The missiles seem like something out of a Godzilla movie, while the various ray-beams look like they come from Forbidden Planet (I mean no disrespect to that movie - only to the much later Superman III!) \n\nOne good thing about Superman III is that it helped me to appreciate director Richard Donner\u0027s take on the character more. The first Superman film does feature some silly comedy moments, but it also has some dignity and genuine drama. Superman III, on the only hand, is just two hours of silliness and stupidity. It\u0027s not witty, it\u0027s a condescending bore.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
