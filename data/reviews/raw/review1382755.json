The story isn\u0027t all that great but shines occasionally. But i think the biggest problem i had with the whole thing was the change of the main focus, i think it would have been better if they had focus on making the story around Judith and Jermemy. \n\nTo sum up it is just about worth watching if you liked the first installment, but personally I prefer the book to them both!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
