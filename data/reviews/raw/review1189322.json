Some of my buddies rag on me calling it a \"chick flick\", but it is as good any movie of the past 25 years.I have to watch it every time it airs. I just missed half of a football game because I kept jumping back to Tomatoes! Great screenplay (and novel).And what a great cast!\n\nWell I see that my comment was not long enough so I will say how doggone hot Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary Louise Parker are!!! have they ever been anything that wasn\u0027t good, and I mean I even liked Bad Girls, or whatever it was called, with Masterson. Well I have now typed enough lines, but now I want to talk about Masterson\u0027s great smile for ten more lines.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
