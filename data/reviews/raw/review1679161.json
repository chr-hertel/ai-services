The dialogue was minimalist and poignant. The director wants us to see the film through our own imagination and think our own thoughts. The film is an intelligent one which allows us to decide what we make of it. For me the story is about enlightenment and finding one\u0027s own path. It is about accepting reality for what it is and waking up. The actors reacted superbly to say the least and made the story believable. The choice of music and the added special effects blended perfectly with the story. Being the highly critical person I am, I tried to look for faults but just could not find any, except that some parts are too ambiguous for people who may just want pure entertainment. This should certainly be an award winning piece. I would certainly have given Le Prix d\u0027Un Certain Regard if not the Palme d\u0027Or for this short. I would recommend to everyone who wants to enjoy a superb piece of art. This director with his peculiar style will go far. He is in the league of the chosen ones; he has talents and does not need luck. I can\u0027t wait to see his next project which undoubtedly will be another winner. My favourite part lasted 25 minutes and I was under the magical spell cast from this grand film right till the end.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
