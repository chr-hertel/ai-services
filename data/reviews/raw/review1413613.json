The procedure worked much better with this story than the Big Sleep, providing just the right amount of sleazy confusion with the dovetailing plot lines working well for each other. Hollywood sanitised and almost soft-boiled it but it\u0027s still a quintessential noir and in my top 100 somewhere.\n\nMarlowe gets ordered to find a cute girl Velma for chunky Moose Malloy fresh out of prison. This embroils him in the other thread concerning the apparent theft and ransom of a $100,000 jade necklace. With many twists and turns, a thousand metaphors and quotable Chandlerisms the threads converge into a satisfying denouement. The atmosphere is laid on thickly with the help of some glorious gleaming b\u0026w photography on nitrate stock and realistic acting from all concerned. This is the bit that still surprises people - that Dick Powell could and did turn in such a good performance, so good in fact it altered the direction of his future career. He applied far more self-deprecating humour to the role than Bogart - I always wished that the pair of them had re-visited the character, they were both so good. Anne Shirley had a good part and was excellent eye-candy, but Claire Trevor\u0027s hairstyle ages the film more than anything else.\n\nAll in all still a fantastic 90 minute trip into Hollywood\u0027s version of Bay City, better than the Falcon\u0027s truncated outing, and with the truer atmosphere and more restraint better than Mitchum\u0027s.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
