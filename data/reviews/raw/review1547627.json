I am here to tell you that I just came from a private screening of this movie this evening and all I can say is WOW! I think this is one of the most touching movies I have ever seen. I cried, I laughed, I got so into the movie that I almost felt that I was actually seeing it through their eyes like I was there in that exact moment. What a wonderful cast! Matthew McConaughey was so believable that he could get a nominee for best leading actor in a drama. Matthew Fox who plays the main character on \"Lost\" was also great in his supporting role. I actually came home and immediately had to look on google to learn more that is how intriguing this movie affected me. (that is how I found this website) If you are doubting for one second whether or not to go see it because you don\u0027t live in WV, I urge to reconsider and give it a chance. You will not be disappointed. It is a great movie for the whole family.\n\nAs soon as it comes out on DVD, you can bet I\u0027ll be one of the first ones standing in line to buy it. I would love to share this heartwarming and heart-wrenching film with my whole family.(we are a football family \u0026 very emotional, this movie will fill both of those needs) You cannot lose with this one. It is that good. :) Hope this helps! Angie", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
