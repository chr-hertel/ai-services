A stranger arrives to a small town that is Superior (in something you\u0027re about to identify). 5 years before the 2002 movie \u0027Eight Legged Freaks\u0027 was made, also in Arizona, here you have two-legged freaks near what you could call a Hobbesian state of nature or a psychological \u0027bellum omnium contra omnes\u0027. But you won\u0027t need to speak Latin to decipher what\u0027s happening and why. It\u0027s all there in human interactions in everyone\u0027s life, being not specific to a climate or a geographical location, although here, in the above described Arizona setting, it\u0027s present in an extreme form, and is complicated by some no less extreme aberrations of the characters. Apocalyptic plot twists, rhyming with the landscape, in a mixture of Hitchcock and Tarantino. Although you\u0027ll find Oliver Stone and Sean Penn together on this team, here there\u0027s no political agenda, just subtle, clever, amusing story-telling. The acting is great all around, but I\u0027d give special mention to Billy Bob Thornton. When I realized whom he was playing, I was really astonished. What a transformation from this humanoid chameleon of acting.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
