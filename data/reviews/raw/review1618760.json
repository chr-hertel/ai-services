The events in the lives of some \"swinging people\" in the supposed 1960\u0027s. My comment: I find it quite an unrealistic movie, as the actors, who play \"people in the 1960\u0027s\", absolutely are unlike people in that era. They \u0027d rather be seen as contemporary people, who have been dressed up with \" sixties \" like (and in that respect not even true!) hair-do\u0027s, and costumes. I was an adolescent myself in the years 1964-1972 (the real 60s), and I have very well \"lived\u0027 that age in all its newness. (I didn\u0027t enjoy that much sex as well, I am sorry to admit) But, as may be seen from old youth programs from television, that can be re-seen on websites, (like in Holland ,they exist, reviving vintage 60s discussions, forums, pop-shows, etc.) the attitude of young people, then was much more timid, hesitant, shy, etc. much more than the self esteemed style of modern actors. And, do you, modern viewer think that in those days Sex was talked about like in this film? I doubt it. This film is just as untrue, as Grease (what a comparison) to the real rock \u0026 roll- life style of the 1950s. Dreamt up by some people of this age . And on the soundtrack, it has mostly very boring too-well-known hits, and a lot of soul as well, which was quite fringe in those years. So?" }
