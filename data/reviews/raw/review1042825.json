There are the movies that are made because someone believed they would and they held out long enough to get them made. Then there are the \"actor\u0027s movies,\" the ones any actor worth his/her salt would love to make themselves. This is Kevin Spacey\u0027s \"actor\u0027s movie.\" That\u0027s not a bad term in the least. The majority of the movie is set inside a New Orleans bar, but the scenery doesn\u0027t get tiresome. This is due to the fantastic performances of the cast. I love it when I can watch a movie and forget that the person I\u0027m watching is otherwise known as Gary Sinise, Faye Dunaway, or Viggo Mortenson.\n\nThe film is also a classic tale of inhumanity, on how far people need to or will go to save their own skin, on choices. It sounds clich√©, but the movie doesn\u0027t come across that way in the least. Overall, I recommend the film for a lazy Saturday afternoon, like it was for me.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
