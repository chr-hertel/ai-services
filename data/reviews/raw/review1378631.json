The plots are always artificial. The knock on \"An Ideal Husband\" has always been that it is not as funny as some of the other plays and that it is overly dependent on romantic love, not a characteristic Wildean pose. Nevertheless, as a film, this may be the best realized of Wilde\u0027s plays. The cast is top drawer, including not only the principals (Jeremy Northam, Cate Blanchette, Rupert Everett, Minnie Driver and Julianne Moore as the play\u0027s beautiful villainness) but also the wonderful John Wood as the father of Everett\u0027s character. Wood isn\u0027t especially well known for his movie roles but he is one of the great English stage actors and he steals every scene he\u0027s in -- against rather stiff competition. Among the lead actors, Everett and Moore are especially good but they also have the best material to work with. Go see \"The Importance of Being Earnest,\" of course, and \"Lady Windermere\u0027s Fan,\" which are superior dramas. But I don\u0027t think they\u0027ve been done on film as well as this one has.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
