The stabbings were more graphic than a film of this nature usually drags out. The nudity was a bit OTT (and a tad unrealistic.) But the feminist undertones were a welcome addition.\n\nThe mondo style scenes probably shook a few people up, but this is a mainstay of most Asian horror. And mondo fans would probably be disappointed. The disembowelment scene was a gross-out. The live worms helped.\n\nChinese female vampires? Use you imagination guys. Or see the film.\n\nAnd fans of Johnny Carpenter\u0027s \"Big Trouble In Little China\" will spot big Carter Wong as a horseman.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
