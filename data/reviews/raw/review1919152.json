A young man and woman are lovers, and she is watched by her neighbor, the unpopular Mr. Hire, black sheep of a Paris near-suburban nabe. They begin a friendship, and even a relationship of sorts, while a cop tries to pin the murder of a young local girl, also an odd duck, on Mr. Hire. Not wanting to spoil the story for you, I won\u0027t say more, except to say that the slow parts are tolerable if you know in advance that this is a very thoughtful, haunting movie and you\u0027ve got to be a little patient for the wonderful reward, which comes right at the end. Very pretty music, beautiful colors and details, lots of sad little moments that remind you of the loneliness of daily life. I wouldn\u0027t actually recommend this to most people. I don\u0027t think they\u0027d tolerate the lack of Hollywood flash. If you\u0027re smart, you\u0027ll watch it though. I got it on DVD at a public library and wish I could see it on a big screen, though the DVD images are very lovely." }
