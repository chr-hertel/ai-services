The view of the film is very similar.\n\nHowever, I fell in love with the story, more so than I did with Spirited Away, it had a more grown-up aspect to it and it was still as magical as Spirited away.\n\nA story about courage, dealing with what you\u0027re given and it\u0027s so romantic that keeps you touched all the way through and allows you into the fantastic world that is Howl\u0027s Moving Castle.\n\nMaybe not as artistic in the making as Spirited away (although it\u0027s very artistic on its own), but I find the story just as beautiful or even more so. The movie looks well, it\u0027ll keep you entertained and it\u0027s not very long either, not slow-paced at all and simply beautiful to watch.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
