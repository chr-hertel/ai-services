The special effects in \"Tremors\" were twice as good as this movie. Classic Stephen King bad acting... I can\u0027t believe the dude from Punisher did this movie. I bet he fired his agent after the screening. I was so excited, because \"Stand by Me\", \"The Green Mile\" and \"Shawshank\" are 3 of my fav all time movies... another flop from King! Get it together King! You haven\u0027t had a decent movie since Green Mile. Remember its all about \"quality\" not \"quantity\"!! Not even worth watching if your friend rented it on DVD. Super disappointed to say the least. I watched half the crowd walk out 20mins into it, as I sat there saying to myself \"maybe, just maybe\"... boy was I the sucker.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
