It was great to see the Peanuts gang in their first film after A Boy Named Charlie Brown but i thought it was an emotional kids movie since the mood swung from happy to sad and back to happy again. It started happy when Snoopy went to the beach to meet Peppermint Patty than went to sad when we first saw Lila, Snoopy\u0027s original owner in the hospital, lonely and sad while we heard the song \"Do You Remember Me?\" one of several songs in the movie written by The Sherman Brothers. Also memorable were several scenes where Snoopy got kicked out of various places with a bass voice (Thurl Ravenscroft) bellowing \"NO DOGS ALLOWED!\" \n\nI thought the scenes where everybody was in tears at Snoopy\u0027s going-away party and Charlie Brown choking up were so sad. Same with his song \"It Changes\" with his spoken interlude about hating goodbyes. I have also thought that Charlie Brown\u0027s least favorite words were \"Goodbye\" and the song got to the point. But it turned out to be a happy ending when Snoopy returned. Woodstock, making his debut as Snoopy\u0027s bird buddy was delighted to see him. \n\nFor those of you who saw Snoopy, Come Home and plan to watch it with your kids, I suggest you bring a box of tissues." }
