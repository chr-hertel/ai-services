The idea isn\u0027t original, nor unique, nor good.\n\nSuppose to be a comedy but it\u0027s only funny for a few seconds. Rest of it is plain stupid! The plot to the movie doesn\u0027t seem to have a good flow to it.\n\nToo much gross out stuff, and jokes that aren\u0027t even that funny.\n\nSome of you would say I\u0027m crazy, but this wasn\u0027t my kind of movie.\n\nThis is not your moneys worth. It\u0027s deserves to be buried 1000 feet underground and never see the light of day for eternity! I give it a 1 out of 10. And place it on one of the bottom 100 films lists.\n\nIt\u0027s not worth buying nor worth seeing more than once. Save your money for something good! If you dislike this review then go ahead and place No on \"Is this review helpful\". Cause this would be the last choice I\u0027d pick for a movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
