It was one of the originals or Cartoon Cartoons. I loved every episode and just couldn\u0027t get enough of it. It made you laugh til you fell off a chair or something. I used to laugh hard on this show and little did I know that I would be obsessed with it. I also liked watching the marathons also like Ed-dependence Day back in July 2001 or The best day Edder. I really liked it a lot. Today I wish Cartoon Network would re-air the old and new episodes again. I got Season 2 and 3 on my computer and it still makes me laugh.\n\nI feel sorry for kids these days who haven\u0027t watched this state-of-the-art funniest show on television.\n\n10/10 and still laughing...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
