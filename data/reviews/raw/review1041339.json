I don\u0027t care that Mike Myers wasn\u0027t in it because, to be honest, I\u0027m not a big fan of the Halloween series. The movie was just horrible. Sure, some director tries to do something differet. Does that make it a good movie? Far from it! The plot was just awful, the acting was awful, the ending was awful. \"Season of the Witch\" is a generic Halloween seasoned title even if there was no witch in the movie. There was no character development, the main guy we can only assume is a creep for cheating on his wife. Unfortunately, my friend had to buy this movie to complete the Halloween series. What a horrible mistake. He will never again look at that DVD again.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
