Curses to you both Ron Moore and David Eich- you have made it impossible for me to watch \"Star Trek\" again. Not since the first \"Matrix\" film in \u002799 have I sat at a screen and gaped in awe at the push my brain was given.\n\nIn three hours, we are introduced to a world, and a cast of characters, that are unrivaled in depth and seriousness. The story is compelling beyond belief. We are really there. We really care.\n\nTopical, directed with talent and passion, and acted by people who deeply care about what they are creating, Battlestar Galactica sets the standard by which any filmed drama must be measured.\n\nNothing else will satisfy again. May BSG reign for years to come.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
