When he hires Jews he is automatically saving them from death, so he does so, but only in secret he knows the real reason of Jew-hiring otherwise, he would be accused of betrayal against the Germany.He even gets to pay money to the Nazi\u0027s to hire Jews, and that\u0027s when he makes a sacrifice and invests the money he made from the war, and so he proofs once again why he is worthy of acknowledgement.\n\nAll that is about the plot, but i have to say that the way Spielberg carries the story is really interesting and makes you stay still in front of the TV, he shows us a view of World War II from another perspective than the traditional of the battles, it shows us how much that group of people suffered in that particular period of history and why we shouldn\u0027t forget the past to don\u0027t make the same mistakes in a future.\n\nFirst, when the movie is just beginning you wonder why is it in black and white, but then you realize it is some kind of history lesson, and Spielberg didn\u0027t actually need the colour for this movie, it had no special effects and was focused in the plot, and the development of it. In this movie he demonstrated why Cinema is considered as another art.\n\nFor all this is that this movie deserves to be with the greatests movies ever, and mainly because the story told is true and no fiction.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
