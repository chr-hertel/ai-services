Once the French surrendered to Germany in 1940 and became their allies, their colonies around the globe were left to decide whether to go along with the Vichy government or throw in their lot with the British and continue to fight the Nazis. The film particularly follows one man on the island who is the head of the underground movement.\n\nThis is a very odd film. During WWII, Alfred Hitchcock made two short propaganda films in French! Everyone speaks French and I wonder if Hitchcock himself understood the language. Considering how weak this short film is, I assume he didn\u0027t! Unlike most propaganda films, this film is way too talky and slow. Additionally, it\u0027s not exactly inspiring. There simply is no action or suspense and the film is amazingly uninspiring. All these factors led the British government to say \"thanks but no thanks\" to the director when he tried to help out with the war effort.\n\nFYI--I noticed one reviewer gave the short a 10. When I checked, I noticed that out of dozens and dozens of their reviews I perused, all had received 10s--every last one.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
