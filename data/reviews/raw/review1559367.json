It\u0027s part martial arts, part prison drama, part horror....all washed down with over-the-top action and violence, delivered with a comic twist.\n\nThe film is based on a Manga comic and tells the tale of the incarcerated Ricky, imprisoned for taking revenge on the killers of his girlfriend. In prison, Ricky fights for survival and justice against a number of unusual enemies. It\u0027s a simple enough tale but one that is delivered in a very entertaining way - I watched it with a very big grin! Although it appears to have been made on a shoe-string budget, this Hong Kong produced film is high on originality and is a great beer and popcorn movie. Invite some friends over - this film is best enjoyed with company. It\u0027s great fun and well worth a rental. I bought blind and certainly don\u0027t regret it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
