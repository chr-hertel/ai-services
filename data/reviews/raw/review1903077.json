Russian Director with Rus/USA team made a great Russian/American Movie and proved that the Rus/USA mix in cinema could be a good thing. McAvoy and Jolie did a great job, great acting. Look at Jolie\u0027s reaction after McAvoy takes the gun and try to escape from this crazy place. I\u0027m sure Stanislavsky said \"I believe\" from the sky at this moment. Special effects are awesome. It\u0027s not Hollywood Sp.Ef. It\u0027s Timur\u0027s Original Style with Sp.Ef. Looks beautiful. The story i think is a mix from Matrix and Fight Club but it\u0027s OK. It\u0027s not about plagiarism, it\u0027s about parody. Hope Timur will do Hollywood again. 10/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
