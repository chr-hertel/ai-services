Why? They\u0027re freakin\u0027 penguins, they can\u0027t even survive in warm weather. If you\u0027re going to make a shitty animated film about antarctic animals with too many celebrity voices, make it about polar bears, that hover around with chainsaws.\n\nNothing about this movie is funny at all, the witty one-liners fail at being witty, and can be seen from a mile away. Everything about this movie sucks, I mean why waste these actors/actresses talents when they can be used to make some uncredited re-make of a Japanese film that was actually good.\n\nI feel that animated animal movies NEED to come to an end. Either that, or make them suck a bit less. I really regret spending money on this when I could\u0027ve been home watching hockey or ranting incoherently about other movies I hate on IMDb\u0027s poorly structured message boards.\n\nThe fact that the commercial says \"Novembuuurrrr\" takes away all the limited credit this movie doesn\u0027t have. Seriously, if you\u0027re thinking of going to see this, pick up a video game controller or a shot gun and do something useful with your time.\n\nOverall Rating: 0/10, but since IMDb does not allow for this, I\u0027d give it a 1/10. This movie is awful and anyone who showers it with golden compliments is just as awful. Also, they are hell spawned battle swine.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
