The opening scenes that introduce the characters are pretty silly, but once the fire is blazing and the rescue attempts begin, the movie is quite exciting and you find yourself guessing who\u0027s going to make it and who won\u0027t. Aided by state of the art special effects (for 1974), the all-star cast is headed by Steve McQueen as the head fireman and Paul Newman as the architect who designed the building. The film also features Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Susan Blakely, Richard Chamberlain (in an especially slimy turn as the contractor whose shortcuts in meeting safety codes may have been the cause of the fire), OJ Simpson, Jennifer Jones, Robert Vaughn, Robert Wagner, and Susan Flannery. Fred Astaire received his only competitive Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as a charming con man who falls for Jones. A rousing and exciting adventure that will keep you glued to the screen.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
