It\u0027s the talk of the town that movies based on Charlie Kaufman scripts are not for everyone. One of the better qualities of the movie is that you might not expect it to be a sci-fi. It\u0027s full of surprises. I\u0027ve heard people walked out on it in theaters, probably expecting another mediocre Jim Carrey comedy. Too bad for them.\n\nIt\u0027s not as dark as Being John Malkovich, though it is deeper. The two main characters do not seem as neurotic as their Kaufman based \u0027predecessors\u0027. Although they are still insecure, somewhat in doubt and \u0027looking for their own piece of mind\u0027. That\u0027s why we like them so much. Their seemingly insignificant inner characteristics can be easily exposed to a two hour \u0027investigation\u0027. And that\u0027s pretty much what all the movies that have been written by Charlie Kaufman are about. Each time, the audience is sent on a brief inner expedition, into a not so prominent individual. \n\nBesides the story it is all enriched with excellent music. A calm little tune is played every now and then that makes the whole thing more memorable. After it\u0027s all said and done a mix of bitter-sweet sensation takes you over. And you feel the need for love, like the eternal sunshine.\n\n........ +4/5 ........", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
