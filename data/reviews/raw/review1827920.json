Foster is superb as ever, creating a deeply believable mix of vulnerability, bewilderment and toughness in Meg Altman (Kidman\u0027s loss was our gain, methinks), and she\u0027s matched at every turn by Stewart as her disapproving and resourceful 12 year old daughter. Whittacker and Yoakam add rich layers of pathetic good and menacing evil (although Yoakam is a little self-serving in the 3 DVD set commentary, if you ask me). Only Leto hits a wrong note, giving a deeply overplayed and caricatured illustration of over-acting.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
