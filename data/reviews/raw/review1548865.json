Now, I can\u0027t say that I\u0027ve had honour of meeting the man personally, but he is quite the Celebrity in S.A.\n\nNow, I know that a lot of people are going to put this documentary into the \u0027mockumentary\u0027 pile, but before you do, I think their are some facts you should know.\n\n1)Despite what was shown on the documentary, Wayne has a great vocal range and when he is most comfortable, he sings excellently.\n\n2) He would be considered by many to be \u0027eccentric\u0027, this in itself, is all part of his charm.\n\n3) He is an expert in Music History, most notably pop from the 50\u0027s onwards.\n\n4) What you saw of him on T.V in relation to his persona, is 100% accurate, what you see is what you get. No scripts, just 100% Wayne. \n\nHe might not crack the top 40 anytime soon, but the man has an immense amount of talent, it\u0027s just not what your used to.\n\nHopefully, they continue following Wanye, not necessarily for the music, but for a glimpse into the extraordinary life into a man with a passion, who\u0027s not ashamed to say anything he feels, or to wear speedos. That, in my humble opinion, is brave.\n\nGo Wayne, you\u0027ve got my vote." }
