Jack is a Dude!!!!! It is full of witty humour and has a strangely likable bad guy for the villain. If you\u0027ve got kids and you\u0027d like them to watch something with some sort of morals, then samurai jack is perfect - he fights the world of evil and you get to see his spiritual zen side too. I think he could be the perfect role model for people of all ages because he always does the \"right\" thing. Made by the same guy that did Dexter\u0027s laboratory, another wicked cartoon which if you liked that one, your sure to like this.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
