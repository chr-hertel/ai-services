Everything is intelligently told except for the flaw of excessive bloodshed. Apart from that, the film is OK on many levels; original for starring an all-female team, it provides convincing roles for every character. But \"The descent\" is not merely action since the director and the wonderful actresses get to unleash properly, very properly, horrific moments and tension. The audience slowly realizes that they all gotta pay attention to the other gals and that enemies are not those terrible creatures. All things considered, not a must-see film but quite interesting.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
