At least I didn\u0027t have to pay to rent it but I do have to pay for the electricity to watch the DVD, so I wasted that money. To think, I almost rented something else but then thought it might be a good zombie movie. This movie makes Shaun of the Dead look like a masterpiece. By the way, that movie had more f words than this piece of crud. I didn\u0027t even know what the movie was about until I read the review after I watched the movie. This must have been a fifth grader\u0027s school project. I am hoping that if I ever come across a zombie that he doesn\u0027t run, talk or carry sharp implements. I just can\u0027t get over how much this movie sucks. Guess I\u0027ll just watch Dawn of the Dead for the millionth time.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
