Exceptionally well-made picture from canny director Neil Jordan, who also penned the screenplay and won an Oscar. Too bad the third act is so convoluted, and the final scene so banal, that a slight dissatisfaction clouds the overall result. Nevertheless, a daring and provocative piece with excellent performances. **1/2 from ****", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
