But you have to be in the mood for this one, IMO.\n\nApparently I have to write more. Interesting to see Owen Wilson playing a different sort of part - I wonder if Jeff Goldblum will ever do that? William Dafoe plays a very uncharacteristic role too - and is funny in that.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
