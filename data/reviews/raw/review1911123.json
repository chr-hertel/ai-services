He wants a bit of action with a gang led by sharp, smoothie, sadistic, snooker-playing knuckle-duster wielding Narcy (Narcissus)(Griffith Jones) - but he baulks at their drug (sherbert!) dealing side. So he\u0027s framed into a cop murder - very heavy stuff in immediate post-war England. But this isn\u0027t The Blue Lamp - it\u0027s nearer Jules Dassin\u0027s famous Night and the City and precedes both.\n\nAs well as a crackling script by Noel Langley we\u0027ve got a runaway fugitive we know is innocent, more bobbies, more rain, and a head-butting, knife-throwing, rooftop-climbing finale.\n\nA great British noir sadly often overlooked. See it!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
