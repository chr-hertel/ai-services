However, while viewing the film I realized that this is one of the most overrated films I have seen. This film would have been better off as a pornographic film considering the first thirty minutes is basically that anyway. What makes my previous comment valid is that the small amount of violence that actually occurred in the film was not actually as intense as the reviews might suggest. I admit I am not easily scared, but this movie made me feel bad for providing revenue for its makers. I know many of you film-goers have faith in Quentin Tarantino, but I think he made a mistake to endorse and produce this film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
