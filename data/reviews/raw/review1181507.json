This time around we have a telekinetic girl who proves to be Jason\u0027s match but they don\u0027t meet until after Jason has already hacked a few teenagers to bits.\n\nThis proves to be quite the stupid affair. This kills are downright boring (though not the fault of it\u0027s director, the MPAA was especially prudish when downsizing the film\u0027s gore), it\u0027s got no suspense, the humor misses big time (unlike part 6) and the Carrie inspired twist is awfully handled. Couple that with extreme bad acting and a ridiculous finale (even that was taken out of the director\u0027s hands) you end up with a disappointing entry in this long running franchise.\n\nBut not all is bad. Kane Hodder is great as Jason, there\u0027s a decent showdown between \"Carrie\" and Jason near the end and it\u0027s got good production values. If an ultimate cut would surface, leaving all the gore intact this film would easily be a lot better, that is after all what we want from these films. This film reportedly had a lot of gore cut out, some of which can be seen on the Friday Box Set in a rough cut.\n\nHate those blasted MPAA a-holes.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
