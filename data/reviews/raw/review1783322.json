I was in sixth and seventh grade at the time,and I was in the last phases of my \"completely lacking irony\" youth when it came to viewing television. Therefore,the straightforward,loud,bombastic and sometimes funny concoction that sprang forth from Stephen J.Cannell\u0027s famous typewriter was perfect viewing for me then. Anytime I watch it of late,I can,however,still choke down my now innate sense of skepticism or irony about entertainment whenever I hear that famous opening credit sequence.\n\nThe exploits of a group of once-convicted Vietnam Army vets,who escaped from the brig and went to lay low as friendly mercenaries didn\u0027t just push the boundaries of believability;it right down blasted right through them! Leader HAnnibal(George Peppard),second-in-command B.A.(T,FOOL!),FAce(Dirk Benedict,not a hair out of place coming from \"BAtlestar GAlactica\")and MUrdock(Dwight \"Howlin\u0027 MAd BArclay\" Schultz) were somehow able to evade government manhunts yet were able to be contacted by various under-thumb little folk to aid from the tyranny of various thieves,crooks,bullies and general rogues. Lots of gun-play,car-wrecks and explosions,yet few(if any)casualties or major damage. This lasted until the last season,when the Army finally caught our heroes,and that\u0027s where I mostly lost interest(though not because of the presence of veteran actor Robert VAughn).\n\nIN sum,despite my evolving taste in television and movies over the years,I still get a kick looking in on an episode of this show. Those who cannot suspend their utter disbelief with the elements of this show need not apply." }
