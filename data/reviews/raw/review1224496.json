It uncovers the dark side of married life, the preservation of life and the stark contrast between people tied together by blood. Elements of this film are nightmarish and reminiscent of the work of David Lynch. Visuals are surreal and interesting. Campion successfully captures the emotions of the protagonist and the dislike she feels toward her sister, Dawn. You can sense the hate/love relationship the family feels toward Dawn. It\u0027s so well done that you start to dislike her also and she\u0027s seen as thorn. The most powerful scene in this film is at the end. Overall this film is one of Campion\u0027s most original and interesting pieces of work.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
