I would have to say this movie was right on the money. To the US turning its back on the Kurds to President Clinton turning his blind eye to Osama (dont that sound like Obama). Hell Iran had Osama arrested and asked Clinton if he wanted him, Clinton said no. Even though Clinton the one that thought you could only go after these monsters was through the court system had a murder warrant out for Osama, Clinton let him go. This movie can be backed up from DoD and state department records. I am just glad we finally have a president with a back bone like Honorable president Bush and not a wimp liberal like Clinton or Gore to turn a blind eye to the real threat of terrorism.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
