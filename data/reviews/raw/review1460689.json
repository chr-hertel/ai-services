The writers are great, witty, stylish...the character arcs just keep moving and the actors are absolutely making this show the best! I can\u0027t believe some of these actors have been working a long time and I haven\u0027t noticed them. I love that there is balanced time for all the characters throughout the season, not too much emphasis on one set of characters or another. I\u0027ve spent the summer catching up on the first season, which I had missed and watching last season again, and I\u0027m not big on reruns. So what can I say? I just really like this show. I can\u0027t wait for the new season! My favorite episode? Season 2\u0027s--after the Superbowl, 2-parter. Edge of your seat!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
