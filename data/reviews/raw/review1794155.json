While it\u0027s unlikely they\u0027ll make more episodes as daringly different as this one, what \"24 Minutes\" proves is that the writers still can come up with fresh ideas and jokes and even have the courage to break loose from the format that has kept the show on the air all these years.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
