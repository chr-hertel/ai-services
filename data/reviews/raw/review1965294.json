Poor.", "reviewBody": "Did someone who consider this piece of Hollywood-crap good ever chose some spare tome to just read the book? Who did pay Peter Buchman, the author of the screenplay for this very poor piece? The plot is wrong, the story is not right... why didn\u0027t they tell the story as described in the book - it could have been so easy and would have been so much more fun! Where are the \"knurlas\", what happened to the reading of the minds of other creatures? I don\u0027t know where to start or to stop... and even big Hollywood names couldn\u0027t save it from being a piece of crap. This movie doesn\u0027t catch the spirit, soul and fantasy of the wonderful and very faithful novel by Christopher Paolini. The last thing I have to say about this movie: Boetq Istalri! Brisingr! Don\u0027t pay for this Hollywood-buyout destroyed movie... go buy the book and use your own fantasy...\n\nSe onr Svedar sitja hvass!" }
