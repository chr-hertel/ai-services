Simply horrible.", "reviewBody": "When I finished watching the movie \"Mars Attacks\" on television several years ago, I literally stared at the screen and said: \"Wow. That\u0027s an hour and a half of my life I\u0027ll never have back.\" This movie didn\u0027t even try to be good. Why in the good Lord\u0027s name did these actors (particularly the several who actually are quite talented) consent to be casted in this bastardization of the film industry? Tim Burton needs to stick to movies like \"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\" because frankly, he can\u0027t do much else. This movie followed the standard formula: \n\nClich√©d plot +Attempted Humor x Zero Effort \u003d Crap.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
