I love it! I love it!", "reviewBody": "I\u0027ve waited for the release of THE PAINTED VEIL for months. Finally I had the chance to see it. This is one truly unique movie and i loved every minute of it. I love Edward Norton, i love Naomi Watts, i love John Curran. This is the perfect love story. The movie is slow and passioned. Every second i expect something to happen - it\u0027s very intriguing - the way the story develops...it\u0027s like slow river( it\u0027s strange definition, but that\u0027s the way I feel about it). and the love story makes you feel dizzy only the way the smell of flowers and trees in springtime makes you. For an eternal romanticist like me the love between Walter and Kitty is the perfect one. I love the fact they fall in love after they get married. I really admire Walter Fane. He is strong and tender, sensitive and considerate. Edward Norton is great actor and he is my favourite actor ever since i saw FIGHT CLUB. I love his movies.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
