Set up with multiple stories going on simultaneously, this movie talks about the oil industry through different outlooks. This is a pretty slow movie (to my taste) with no real action scenes and a few off-on-a-tangent scenes that the director actually ties back into the movie. If you are interested in politics, the oil industry, or thinking movies, see it. It\u0027ll put an interesting twist on your thoughts about the oil dilemma that were previously shaped by the media and the government. It depicts how the oil oligopoly controls the middle east and how a war on \"terror\" was brought about due to America\u0027s high dependency on foreign oil. It sheds some light to the views of big business, Iraq\u0027s leaders, the average oil worker, etc; views that average American\u0027s will never see or really think about.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
