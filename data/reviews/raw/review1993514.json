What a star we have here in Eliza Burnett. Could it be released as a single? Why not? The orchestral soundtrack is also just so atmospheric.\n\nI had never read any of the books but found the whole film astounding in it\u0027s imagery and story. At over 50 years of age I thought I couldn\u0027t go \"wow\" anymore. How wrong I was.\n\nThe film had that special blend where reality starts to merge with the magical. It creeps up on you until you are taken along with the flow. Just go and experience a great film. Do not leave until the final credits have rolled so you hear \"that song\".", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
