I didn\u0027t see the UK version, but I saw the American version which is known as way worse than the UK version. The contents are similar but the humor of Stromber is so much better in my opinion. You have to be a fan of that special \"Stromberg humor\". If you understand that kind of humor you WILL agree that Christoph Maria Herbst is the best actor for that character. He just makes you laugh with every action he does. I don\u0027t think that the 3rd season is gonna be as good as the first two and that Stromberg will loose its humor but you never know... Unfortunately, I won\u0027t be able to watch this 3rd season since I\u0027m currently a foreign exchange student in America but I\u0027m definitely gonna buy the DVD. One more thing to Superunknown: It is true that it doesn\u0027t look spontaneous and realistic but that is part of this humor. You just have love that humor or that series is the worst thing you\u0027ve ever seen.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
