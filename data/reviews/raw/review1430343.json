Finding overland is very much one of those movies. The acting was splended and the whole plot and script was perfectly done. I enjoyed the DVD version of this film very much exspecially the outtakes. This is a must see movie no matter what age you are it will bring the inner child out of you. I am not really a big fan of Kate Winslett but she plays a very good role in this movie and once again she finds a way to make me cry Titanic I needed tissues!!!! Is there a movie that Johnny Depp that Sucks???? I doubt it. The only thing that is poorly done in this movie it was a bit short when it came to his relatrionship with his friends and family I would have gotten to know Barre other than have to look it up on the internet ....Oh well I will give this movie a 8/10" }
