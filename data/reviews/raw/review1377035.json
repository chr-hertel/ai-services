Director\u0027s quitting, director\u0027s being sacked, diva strops by Miss Berry and an awful script, I was sure this film was going to fail. Then the first set a reviews came through and it was not good no-one was saying a nice word about it. However I had to see this film for myself and you know what? It\u0027s really good actually it\u0027s great! Not fantastic but still a great film. Even though X2 is the best of the lot I find X3 creeping past the first film into the number 2 spot! Oh yeah and for all Iceman fans you finally get to see him in full on iceman mode (if only for a short while.)" }
