I also enjoyed the version made it 1981 the T.V miniseries with Irene Richards and Tracey Childs. Both versions were true to the book. I have read all of Jane Austen\u0027s works.\n\nI have several Jane Austen\u0027s works on DVD. I own Persausion, 3 different versions of Pride and Prejudice, Northanger Abbey. This shows that I truly enjoy and look all her literature. For those people who are Jane Austen\u0027s fans check out her books as well as the other movies adapted from them.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
