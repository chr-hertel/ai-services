Most of these, I assume were done to create more cinematic consistency with characters,etc. Generally, I don\u0027t think that they hurt the story.\n\nBut some things do, like Ma wearing earrings, since this undermines the nature of the family\u0027s intense struggle to get by. (sunbonnets also would be a good thing.)\n\n. Generally, my biggest historical problem is that the children seem to be more modern in their mentality-- almost as if they\u0027ll say \"cool\" or \"gee whiz\". This fits with the modern music and seems to have been done to cater to children of today.\n\nSome examples of this more modern sensibility: Laura jokingly asking her father for candy when he goes to Independence (product of modern-day materialism? Laura in the book knew how precious/rare such treats were). Also Laura being the one to suggest that she could wear Mary\u0027s old shoes-- its pretty clear from the book that the Ingalls (most working pioneer families) always handed such precious goods down to one another (they were poor!!) \n\nI also found the scene with Mary confronting Ms. Scott to be ridiculous- both because it was completely inconsistent with Mary\u0027s character according to LIW(good girl vs. Laura as the bad girl) and because it is completely inconsistent with how children would have behaved in the Little House books (children not speaking at the table and definitely not contradicting others). (Ma\u0027s reaction to this offense also is inconsistent, way too chummy)\n\nI do like this series because it has beautiful scenery and deftly demonstrates how terrifying life then could be. (I never thought about, for example, how terrifying Independence was- always taking it instead for a charming town- it is scary) I like also how they show scene through Laura\u0027s perspective- with a sense of childhood wonder.\n\nYet one reason I always loved the books was because the children\u0027s mentalities were different from mine. They were in an earlier, less casual era, that fascinated me. I\u0027d like to see more of that preserved, instead of having it slide so that today\u0027s children can relate to these ones in the series.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
