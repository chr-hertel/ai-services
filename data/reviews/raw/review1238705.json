Shafer, overhears office workers Larry \u0026 Brian, Rod Sweitzer \u0026 Milles Dougal, talk about a bachelor party that\u0027s to be held that evening at their office with booze and grass and semi-nude women being brought in for adult entertainment. \n\nVickers a law \u0026 order nut and a bit into Satanic practices and sacrifices decides to stop these impending breaches of the law, drinking and having sex on the job, before it happens and to punish those criminals who break it and the only way he knows how is with brutal and deadly force. In the Stonecipher Building everyone is ready and expecting to have a good time with Mr. Stonecipher,John Paxton, their boss being told that their staying over to catch up with their backlog of paperwork. Before you know it the local strippers are let into the building by the night watchman Gus, Al Schuerman, and the drinking and partying starts as office worker Gary, Dave Bean, is given his last fling as a bachelor before he ends up getting hooked. It turns out instead to be Gary\u0027s last day alive on earth.\n\nBloody and in some ways hilarious, with a number of sharp and witty one liners by Officer Vickers, horror flick with Vickers knocking off almost everyone at the party. Vickers starts with Gus who he put a pencil through his brain then works his way up the building finishing off everyone else but Brian \u0026 Sharon, Barbara Niven, who survived his rampage. As you would expect Vickers, like almost every villain in these types of films, has superhuman strength and endurance. No matter what happens to him like being pushed down an elevator shaft hit in the midsection ,full force, with an ax and almost having his head burned off with a lighted spray-can he just keeps on going as strong as ever in his crusade to enforce the law that he was sworn to uphold. \n\nThe movie has a scene in it that copies the infamous March 1991 Rodney King police beating with Vickers being beaten and kicked by a bunch of outraged citizens, after trying to murder Sharon, with bats sticks and fists as the entire scene is being videotaped by an shocked onlooker,Adam Rifkin. Still Vickers still manages to survive to live and kill another day in another Psycho Cop movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
