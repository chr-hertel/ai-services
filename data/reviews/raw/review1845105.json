I wish I had listened to him. Two homemade sex movies are merged together with little effects you can find on any average camera. I don\u0027t think even I heard someone speaking in this movie--I remembered why, the player was on fast-play. Video cameras are cheap nowadays and many think they can make a movie. Believe me, this film could have been filmed by a mobile camera. When I first watched it, I thought someone had replaced the DVD because no nobody can sell such a low quality movie but it turned out to be what the character did as claimed !!! I can\u0027t believe some people liked this movie. Just because it looks real!! What\u0027s the unreal thing in a couple having violent sex and being filmed. I think the actress was in a desperate need for money to be involved. Don\u0027t waste your time on this movie. \n\nI can\u0027t give it less than 1/10 otherwise I did", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
