When Tiger (voice of Dom DeLuise) got dumped, I wanted to cry. Although some of the characters were diabolical, I liked everybody. Well, it\u0027s hard to say which character was my favorite. If I had to choose, I\u0027d probably choose Tiger, although the mice were good too. The music was good, everyone was cast perfectly, and the direction was flawless. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent sequel for all ages that will warm your heart to anyone who hasn\u0027t seen it. You\u0027re in for a real treat and a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with someone close to you, and watch it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
