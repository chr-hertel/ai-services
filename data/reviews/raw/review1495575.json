Notably in character was a bare chested Patrick Roach as \"Randy\". John Dunsworth as \"Jim Lahey\" patrolled the aisles in the theater checking to see if \"anybody got a lil\u0027 drinky poo?\" I know that laughter in a theater is contagious, but I really thought the movie was hilarious and I plan to purchase the movie DVD. I thought that Mike Smith as \"Bubbles\" probably got the biggest laughs, bringing the house down with the funniest one-liners and close-ups. Robb Wells as \"Ricky\" was terrific as the fast talking schemer and probably did the best acting. John Paul Tremblay as \"Julian\" had great screen presence as the quiet, burly, drink-toting enforcer.\n\nThe movie is all comedy, but it\u0027s a combo of slapstick, mocumentary, drama and action, and it even has its touching moments. I don\u0027t recall anything in the movie that needs to be taken seriously. The characters are at the bottom of the totem pole in life and their exceptionally poor ambition manages to exceed their ability, intelligence or education so they are unable to achieve any of their minimal goals. This cycles them between laziness, poverty and petty crime. Somehow, the characters don\u0027t really seem unhappy, since this is normal to them, and I guess that makes it feel okay for me to laugh at them.\n\nI\u0027m sorry to say I haven\u0027t been faithfully following the TV series, but I now am intent on working my way through the whole series on DVD to get caught up and that\u0027s something to look forward to. I know this will be a big hit in Canada, and I expect it to do very well in the USA and worldwide.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
