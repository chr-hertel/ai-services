But I have my reasons.\n\nFirst of all, this movie seems a bit contradictory in its message. Is it supposed to be antiwar, or are we supposed to be cheering at the gore? Speaking of gore, they wasted it all in the first battle of the film, which is also the first scene after the prologue scene. No good storyteller does that. Since the most graphic images were at the beginning, most everything else seemed tame in comparison.\n\nSecondly, this really isn\u0027t Spielberg\u0027s best film at all. It moves very slowly and is full of scenes that try to build characterization but somehow manage to seem sappy. I\u0027ll give him and the screenwriter credit for trying, however.\n\nAlso, this is possibly John Williams\u0027 worst movie score ever. The music is the kind you can find in any war movie--it\u0027s sort of cheesy and not at all amazing like many of his other works.\n\nLastly, this movie simply does not move. Maybe it was just me, but it didn\u0027t evoke much of an emotional reaction out of me, and I\u0027m normally quite an emotional moviegoer.\n\nTom Hanks did a very good acting job, and the others did okay. But too many of the lines were whispered, or at too low a volume.\n\nMaybe it\u0027s just me, but this movie didn\u0027t move.\n\n5/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
