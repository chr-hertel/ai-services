Before watching, it is important to remember that this film was not done on a big budget, nor is it meant to be seen as anything more than a fantasy film. It is not realistic, as so many of Fulci\u0027s other films are.\n\nFulci achieved an ambiance of cosmic proportions with \"Conquest.\" The fog and the monsters and the creatures are fantastic, I think. Is it cheesy? A little, maybe. But it\u0027s not unlike a dream you wake up from and think, \u0027what the hell was that?\u0027 He treats us to more than you\u0027d expect amounts of gore in \"Conquest,\" more than any fantasy film I\u0027ve ever seen. People getting ripped apart, bludgeoned, etc.\n\nAnother thing I really like about \"Conquest\" is the music and the setting. I think they work so well together. I wonder where he filmed it, and how he achieved the overall darkness. It\u0027s like he only filmed on hazy days.\n\nAnyway, I recommend this to Fulci fans. Other people won\u0027t get it or appreciate it. It\u0027s too ahead of it\u0027s time.\n\n8 out of 10, kids.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
