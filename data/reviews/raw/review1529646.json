It\u0027s nothing about James Bond, and where are the hot bond girls? who knows?\n\nI see that a lot of people thinks that it\u0027s a great movie, but why? even if I repeat, it\u0027s too LONG AND BORING AND IT HAVE NO ACTION, it\u0027s like someone wrote in the reviews, watching the World Championship Poker on ESPN, again too long and too boring.\n\nWhere is the old James Bond? Why is this movie related to the James Bond series?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
