I felt disappointed with the ending and was hoping that this would end the trilogy and make for a good series... How wrong was I??? I think fans will love this and trust me I\u0027m as hardcore as they come... I just wished they had spent more time on the characters than the gore... If you really want to watch this but have not seen one or two - i suggest you do so cause you will be in the gutter if you don\u0027t... I suppose the premise seemed good but things obviously changed as it progressed... I would recommend this and hopefully Saw 4 will be even better...\n\nThis was for the fans...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
