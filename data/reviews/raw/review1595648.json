Quite a ladies man, he sometimes has trouble getting up in the morning so he owns an elaborate, speaking alarm clock which showers him with compliments at his awakening. One day, he finds out he is going to be transferred to Paris for awhile. Anthony is delighted. As adjusting to a new continent is difficult, Anthony is sent to France well in advance of his official starting day at the bank. On the streets of Paris, he notices beautiful Nicole (Jacqueline Bisset) and follows her home. As luck would have it, Nicole is desperately wanting a new maid/nanny for her young daughter. Overhearing this, Anthony decides to announce that he has been sent by the agency to be her new maid! He\u0027ll be able to get to know Nicole better, that\u0027s for sure. However, Nicole\u0027s daughter is a brat and the first day is far from easy. Yet, Anthony perseveres. What is going to happen, though, when AW is due at the bank? And, is there a rival for Nicole\u0027s affections? This is a fun movie with a cute premise. Sheen is great as the man who explores the world outside of the banking business and who learns that the possibility of getting serious about someone is nothing to fear. Bisset is beautiful as the banker who has had lousy luck in her personal life. The rest of the cast is fine and, of course, the setting in Paris is grand. The costumes are a bit lacking or, perhaps, it is just that they seem so dated. But, that\u0027s something minor. If you love romantic comedies, this film is \"maid\" for you. Get your hands on a copy soon.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
