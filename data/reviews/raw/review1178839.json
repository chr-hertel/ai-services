In 5 minutes I learned far more about penguins than this false-documentary explains.\n\nPlease, this is the FOX News of documentaries. It has been edited to specifically draw you across a story, a story which is often made up by the editor, leaving facts behind. There is little knowledge passed, little facts discussed, but there are many tightly edited scenes with Morgan Freeman telling us what we should believe is happening. Disagree? Watch again and notice that when a female penguin slows at a crack in the ice, there is a close-up of her face, a quick edit to a seal attack, then back to her face. This edit means nothing. Nothing. But as a gimmick, it leads us to believe that she is pausing because she is afraid of being killed. Possibly she is. Who asked her though? Where is the scene where the crew asks the penguin if she is afraid? It isn\u0027t there for obvious reasons, but this lack of depth certainly won\u0027t stop the editors and Morgan Freeman from persuading us otherwise.\n\nThe film is so glurgy and sweet that it can\u0027t even use the word death. Pengiuns don\u0027t freeze to death, they fall asleep forever. Chicks don\u0027t die, they are lost.\n\nThis is now my favorite film to hold in contempt against the front of idiots.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
