I will fondly recall it as the show that introduced me to Rosie Perez. She was (and is) a firecracker. I cannot believe there were 18 episodes. I only caught about half, if that. It had an amazing cast, compelling stories and great acting. \n\nAll the shows I like are usually canceled quickly. Looking at the cast, I cannot believe the number of them that have had distinguished careers. I think it was closer in tone to the Lou Grant series, but much better. I never warmed to Lou Grant in the drama world.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
