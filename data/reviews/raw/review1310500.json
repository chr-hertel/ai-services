Sometimes there are moments when one doesn\u0027t see what is happening around him or her. Signals are sent and received, and because of our longing for a past time, we can become victimized by our own longings. This is a film about a man who is as respected as one can be. College professors in Germany at this time were a little like rock stars. Unfortunately, the students weren\u0027t always the ones to show the respect and they could become a little nasty. The professor makes a fatal mistake. Because of his seriousness in his long life, he has not stopped to smell the archetypal roses. When he becomes infatuated with the leggy Marlene Dietrich, it\u0027s all over. She is a consummate flirt. She is not an unkind person. She flirts with all men. After all she works in a music hall. How the professor could be so shortsighted is not known, but there are thousands of such cases where old men have sold their lives for a few moments of affection. He wakes up when it is too late. \n\nI remember this movie fondly. Our local public television station picked up the Janus film festival. And some of my TA friends from grad school would meet on Wednesady nights to watch these. It was my introduction into the viewing of significant films. Renoir, Trauffaut, Lang, etc. It was a marvelous time and we learned a lot.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
