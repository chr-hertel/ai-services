I\u0027m mean, I\u0027ve seen great films but sometimes it seems like they come out like 1-3 yrs after I see them at the festivals. I\u0027m a business major and I\u0027ve got a second major in film production/marketing. So this is still new to me. I saw the film in Jacksonville, Fla with my parents and girlfriend while on break from school. I have to say, I was pretty blown away. I didn\u0027t know any of the actors and I didn\u0027t hear too much about the story until I started at NYU, but I talked to some friends when I got back. I told them to go see the film once it came to NYC for a special screening at a fest over here in September. Now these guys are all film majors and English lit guys. They all seemed to dig it too. I noticed the hottie from Playboy, Angela Little. Nice, babeeeeee. My girlfriend lost her mind when she saw one of the actors in the film and got a pic with him. They had a contest to win a date with him (Sonny Mandal). Even though I didn\u0027t know who he was and I don\u0027t think anyone else did either, but there was a ton of women who wanted to win the date, one of them being my girlfriend. Hey, what the heck! OK, this sounds like a blog now. Sorry. So here\u0027s my take on the film - acting: not too bad at all considering I never heard of any of these guys, but they were good to watch (as they say), story/plot/drama stuff: I guess it could get pretty emotional, but the story was allegedly based on true events and the intense moments were nicely broken up by some funny moments too, characters: pretty believable, especially the guy playing Arjun and the one playing Bobby. There\u0027s a scene with the neighbor and he\u0027s real good too. Anyway, I\u0027m not sure why it is not a film that is out there already. It\u0027s a 9/11 film with a wedding, tragedy, comic stuff (not corny - thank God), and intense life drama. It\u0027s not Shakespeare, but it\u0027s got all the elements (almost). Best to these guys. Good work. See it if you can.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
