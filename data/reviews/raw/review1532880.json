This is one of the few videotapes that i taped (off of PBS) and took with me that EVERY parent did not have a problem with their kid watching. In the age where your TV babysits your child more than you do, this is a program i could turn on and they would actually walk away with something other than mush on the brain. it was good from children 8 to about 14 (my 14 yr old brother (at the time) watched it fascinated for a long time, and is still one of his most cherished memories (one of the few times we didn\u0027t fight was when it was on) if you find it, or get a chance to watch it DO! definitely worth it", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
