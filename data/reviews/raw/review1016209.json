I heard that Carry on Emmanuelle was the worst of the series, but this really is. I bought this and started watching it four times then turned it off...only watched it fully the fifth time around, it\u0027s really that bad.\n\nJoan Sims looks bloated and old, Kenneth Connor\u0027s not the little bloke with humorous quirks that we know and love him for in the series...there\u0027s nothing in here that actually works. There\u0027s no gags that are humorous.\n\nThere\u0027s a hugely embarrassing scene where there\u0027s a soldier blinking heavily....and Kenneth Connor asks him \u0027why he\u0027s blinking\u0027. The gag commences for a minute \u0027why are you blinking?\u0027 \u0027no I\u0027m blinking not\u0027 \u0027yes you blinking are\u0027....That unfortunately is the level of humour used in this awful film.\n\nYou can see them trying to go back to Carry on Sergeant...but that\u0027s like trying to find Debbie Harry attractive when she\u0027s an eighty year old pensioner based on \u0027how she used to be\u0027. \n\nKenneth Connor in his first lead role for the Carry on\u0027s deserved better than this. Patrick Mower is not carry on material.\n\navoid.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
