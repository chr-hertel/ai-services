I hope it never ends. It is pure genius. I only wish Larry would stop saying \"I could care less\". This is a major faux pas for Larry. Improper use of phrases or words tends to irk Larry\u0027s character, but he has missed the boat on this one. The expression is \u0027I couldn\u0027t care less\u0027. The message he is trying to convey is that he doesn\u0027t care at all, but by saying he \u0027could\u0027 care less, he is expressing the exact opposite of what he means to say. I\u0027m aware that this is an often misused phrase, but if you really want to get your message across loud and clear, you say \"I couldn\u0027t care less\", meaning I don\u0027t care at all." }
