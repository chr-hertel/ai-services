He is in a world of drugs and the evil that surrounds that. Rather then glamorize the drug scene as some have suggested this movie goes out of the way to show the filth and vileness of it.\n\nThe lead actor proves he is at the top of his profession.\n\nThere are some irritating scenes in the movie which are perhaps explainable by the film being presented through the eyes of a desperate and drugged up individual.\n\nWorthy of 7 and a half out of 10, rounded down to:\n\n7/10.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
