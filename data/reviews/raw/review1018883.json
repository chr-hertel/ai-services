The disaster was quickly ruled to be the result of natural causes. However, a German journalist spent the next ten years investigating the tragedy, and came up with evidence that the ship was carrying arms and contraband from the remains of the former USSR to the black market in Stockholm. The movie chronicles this reporter\u0027s quest for the truth. Greta Scacchi brings heart and guts to her performance as the journalist, and Jurgen Prochnow delivers a poignant portrayal of a survivor of the tragedy united with the reporter as they search for answers. Donald Sutherland plays a mysterious puppeteer who perhaps has all the answers. The film is tense, emotional, beautifully shot -- a gripping political thriller.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
