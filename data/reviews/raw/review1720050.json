This is the sort of form that goes with Dead Again, a concert filmed in 1980 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. It\u0027s got an enthusiastic crowd always pumped- or as much as a dead-head crowd can get- for the hits, and the Dead themselves are in fine form for much of the concert. A lull might come here and there, even for the die-hard tie-dyed viewing, but there\u0027s nary a moment when it\u0027s ever too boring. The DVD also features some songs that are just as worthy as the rest of the concert.\n\nAnother note of interest: Al Franken, who is a little surprisingly a dead-head himself, having playing more than a few Grateful Dead songs sometimes on his old show on Air America, appears here as the quasi-host along with another comic for the show. Sometimes in-between a song or two it will cut back to Franken (with a big natural head of hair) and the other guy backstage, and it\u0027s one of the best things (as a Franken fan at any rate) in checking out the DVD. He even does a Henry Kissinger imitation- as Kissinger trying to sneak in a tape recorder to bootleg the show!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
