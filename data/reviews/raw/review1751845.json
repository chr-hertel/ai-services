Although it contains much nudity and has received an R rating, this movie is a \"must-see,\" whether you be a lover of romantic comedies or high action movies.\n\nIt delves into the psyche of a murderer without blowing up people or slamming axes into their heads. It is not about murder, though, but more about the alienation and obsession of a person. It is so honest it makes you cringe, and doesn\u0027t hold back on the gritty details of the century, nor on the addiction that the main character has with creating his perfect perfume.\n\nPerhaps it is not exactly true to the book, but for a film that was described as \"unfilmable\" by Stanley Kuprick, it is one hell of an accomplishment that older viewers will find disgusting, but captivating.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
