As in many von Trier\u0027s movies the revelation comes at a climatic moment completely changing the direction and the pace of the film. And suddenly it reveals so many intricate details of the great friendship between these two extraordinary artists of our times.\n\nThe five remakes of \"The Perfect Human\" are as fascinating as the original short and are not to be missed by anyone who is interested in world cinema.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
