The only thing they forgot to tell is that masturbating causes blindness. But then it isn\u0027t even necessary as the main character just stares, and stares ... but let\u0027s assume the movie tries to imply he\u0027s masturbating. Let\u0027s repeat: Watching porn and probably masturbating has several consequences, for example:\n\n\n* You look old and tired: Every teenager not sleeping enough looks like that. What does a typical geek look like?\n\n\n\n* You\u0027ll fail at sports and school: Can be true, but it\u0027s not a consequence of porn, but of any obsessive behavior, computer games or sports (yes, too much training can have an impact on studies, but then we in Europe don\u0027t have a tradition of giving sportsmen and -women a free ticket through higher education) can also lead to the same results.\n\n\n\n* You want to sleep with your GF: Hell, which teen boy doesn\u0027t want to? I would worry more if he wouldn\u0027t!\n\n\n\n* Your friends turn against you: LOL! Usually it\u0027s more like who knows the dirtier jokes in any normal school :)\n\n\nI really like the earlier comment about his small brother playing GTA. It\u0027s true, his Mum doesn\u0027t care her younger son just killed a \"drug dealer\" (Lesson: we don\u0027t need judges anymore). Doesn\u0027t our society have more problems with violence than with sexuality? Let\u0027s do a piece of logic (it\u0027s as wrong as this movie, but let\u0027s try). Islamic Terrorists don\u0027t watch porn, it\u0027s an affront against their religion. Ergo: NOT watching porn makes you a terrorist. \n\nWell, all the uptight Victorian people out there will love this stupid flick.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
