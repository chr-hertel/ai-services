They took the basic concept of it, added places for the love to happen (on a Princess Cruise ship \u0026 in ports of call), a regular crew, \u0026 mass produced 10 years of the Love Boat. Part of the reason it worked was the ship as you could dream of being on a cruise \u0026 never leave your living room.\n\nEach episode usually had 2 or three plot lines with different guests involved. Each one would involve the crew interacting with the guests. Each one would usually have a happy ending. Sometimes, episodes would even go 2 hours. Princess Cruises definitely got a lot of valuable promo from this series.\n\nLike Love American Style, the love aspect would get by with a wink, a grin, \u0026 some subtle hints of the feelings that were really going on. The crew was a pretty talented ensemble. Gavin McCloud as your Captain became more of less the star of the show. Bernie Kopell as the ships playboy Doctor became a key factor a lot of times. Lauren Tewes was the supposed hot cruise director. Then there was Gopher \u0026 the bartender always around either when you need them or not around when you need them.\n\nThe guest stars would read like a whose who of 1960\u0027s \u0026 70\u0027s actors \u0026 actresses. It was amazing how many folks would get drawn on board this ship. Realism, this show has little. Bubble gum for the brain, that is where this show comes from. \"Come Aboard, We\u0027re Expecting you!\"", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
