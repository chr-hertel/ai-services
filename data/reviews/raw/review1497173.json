The movie asks for a great deal of suspension of disbelief, however. An obnoxious spoiled rich girl (Hawn) contracts and then argues with a self-important carpenter (Russell). Later, she\u0027s an amnesiac, who, through a series of contrivances, is tricked into believing she\u0027s the wife of the carpenter. Yeah. That\u0027s the plot.\n\nOnly actors like Hawn and Russell could get away with a premise like this, and they make the most of it. They manage a good deal of screen chemistry, and everyone in the cast works well in spite of their highly unlikely characters. Roddy McDowell obviously had some fun with his role, but he\u0027s wasted as a butler with little screen time. The movie tries to be a family comedy, so the four kids playing Russell\u0027s bratty sons are the biggest liability of the film. They\u0027re just not cute; in fact, they\u0027re quite infuriating. Why Hawn or anyone else would bond with these jerks is a mystery, and makes the whole story difficult to swallow.\n\nYou\u0027ll get a few clich√©s about how poor average Joes with four punk sons are so much happier and nicer than snobby rich folks who own beautiful yachts, but the story has heart nevertheless. With these two stars, it works. Overall, a decent way to spend a rainy afternoon.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
