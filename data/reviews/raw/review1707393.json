This time, he travels to India where he need to find some stones to bring back to a dying village. In the first part of the movie, he\u0027s in Shanghai, China making a deal that goes awry. Indie was given a slow-acting poison; his friend was killed when the cork-popping distraction; he stabbed his killer with the sword dinner; and all this shooting caused a lot of mayhem in the club. He meets Willie(Kate Capshaw), who is a very prissy, and whiny little woman. Then there\u0027s Indie\u0027s side-kick Short Round(Jonathan Ke Quan) who is very dependent and confident in his friend. They go through danger like a hot knife through butter. The action was all there in the movie, also there was some comedy in-between. The dinner scene was a hoot. The food they had was a major freak out for Willie, she told the guy she had bugs already, for lunch. The cult scene was disturbing. The leader rips out the heart of a victim, very blood-curdling. The rest is all there, and it\u0027s great all the way. Few changes were made from the first, the action was never lost. I enjoyed this movie very well! 4.5 out of 5 stars!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
