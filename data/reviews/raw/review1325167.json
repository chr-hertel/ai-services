He misses his initial train and stands under pouring rain getting soaking wet. When he catches the next train 20 minutes later, he\u0027s completely dry and meets Jennifer Aniston looking very suave and well-kept.\n\nHe then goes into work and there he looks damp and his hair is all tousled. The acting seems fair to good and the plot holds your attention.\n\nJennifer looks gorgeous as always and the screen chemistry between the two of them doesn\u0027t seem very believable. She\u0027s definitely out of his league.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
