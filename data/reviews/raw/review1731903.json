This is a terrific film in the genre of \"The Lost Weekend,\" as well as \"Smash Up\" and \"I\u0027ll Cry Tomorrow.\"\n\nThe tragedy here is that Lemmon and Remick marry and have a son. In order to get her into his lifestyle, Lemmon introduces Remick to the bottle and before long she is on par with him when it comes to drinking.\n\nTheir degradation and ultimate ruin brought on by alcoholism is fully realized here. As Remick\u0027s father, Charles Bickford put in still another solid performance. Who can forget his outburst at Lemmon. \"My daughter never drank until she met you.\" The ending of this film will forever tug at one\u0027s heart where Lemmon has tried to stop drinking but it\u0027s off to the bar for Remick.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
