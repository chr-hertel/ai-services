AVP was so horribly written that I am angry I don\u0027t have a job as a writer in Hollywood. My 8 year old daughter could have written better dialog. The plot was actually o.k. If they had known what to do with it. I knew going into the theater that I shouldn\u0027t expect much. But I was still very disappointed. It wasn\u0027t even cheesy enough to make up for the fact that it was so terrible. I would love to meet the person that gave this movie the final go ahead and spent all that money in advertisement for it and sell him some dehydrated water. I should hope someone at the production studio knew they were going to take a bath on this movie. TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE." }
