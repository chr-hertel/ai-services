It starts with tension and pulls us through with humor. This is something quite difficult in the \"short film\" genre. It seems that a lot of short films end up being futile attempts to tell a story, but fall short of this. This film is not one of those. It carries the viewer through in with a linear story, and packs comedy in as well. I recommend this to anyone who\u0027s interested in something other than the run of the mill \"action\" flick. It\u0027s refreshing to be able to know that someone out there knows how to write. Not just how to write, but how to take that written word and direct actors to \"feel\" their characters. This film is really for someone who might be into intelligent conversation and likes films other than just gratuitous sex, idiocy, and violence. I really recommend seeing this film and am anxious to see what the writer/director comes up with next.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
