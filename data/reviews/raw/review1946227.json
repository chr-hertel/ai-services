Mr. Curtis keeps three blondes in one apartment, each thinking she is Curtis\u0027 \"one-and-only\" fiancée. The rotating women are all airline stewardesses, on different timetables. Curtis\u0027 sexy arrangement is discovered by envious old pal Jerry Lewis (as Robert Reed). Mr. Lewis plots to take over the satisfying arrangement of women, after he learns Curtis may be transferred to New York. But, both men are threatened when the stewardesses\u0027 flight patterns change; and, everyone heads for the apartment bed! \n\nFunnier than its reputation; perhaps, the film\u0027s celebration of pseudo-promiscuity distanced it from other sixties sex comedies - the \"romance\" between Lewis and Suzanna Leigh (as Vicky \"British United\" Hawkins) comes closest to \"acceptable\" for the genre. The other two women, hefty knockwurst-loving Christiane Schmidtmer (as Lise \"Lufthansa\" Bruner) and wispy soufflé-loving Dany Saval (as Jacqueline \"Air France\" Grieux), are more funny than romantic. Curtis is finely frantic; however, Lewis, in a lower key, and Thelma Ritter (as Bertha) are more outstanding.\n\n****** Boeing Boeing (12/22/65) John Rich ~ Tony Curtis, Jerry Lewis, Thelma Ritter, Dany Saval", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
