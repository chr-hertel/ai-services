I was watching this with a bunch of friends who are fans of the show and we all came to the same conclusion. This movie blows! The same humor from the characters is their but after awhile it gets boring. The story lacks and it shows, after a while you will not care about the story and you\u0027ll want the movie to end. Once it\u0027s over you will breath a sigh of relief. I can\u0027t believe they brought Futurama back from the dead to produce crap like this. The writers can do better we\u0027ve seen it in the past. I hope the next movie isn\u0027t bad like this one. I love this series but will not waste my money on the next one.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
