High-brow critics often forget that. \"Eraser\" is a prime example. Entertainment alone is how this particular movie survives since common logic doesn\u0027t exist while violence and profanity are overdone. But, despite it\u0027s low-brow tastes and stupidity, it\u0027s still generally fun to watch if you can put your brain on hold for two hours. It\u0027s also fun to hear if you have a nice surround system.\n\nThis movie has one of the most outrageous action scenes I\u0027ve ever seen on film, even to this day: one in which Arnold hangs from the outside of a jet airplane, finally lets go, free-falls to catch his parachute that had been ripped off, and then has to worry about the jet plane which had circled around and was going to smash him!!\n\nThe audio came into play nicely each time the super rifle that was featured in the movie was shot. Vanessa Williams plays the female lead satisfactorily and James Caan is very effective as the villain. Robert Pastorelli and James Coburn also add to the fun. A few laughs along the way help this no-brainer to become even more entertaining.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
