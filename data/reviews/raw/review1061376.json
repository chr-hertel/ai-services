The disturbing amount of cheesy one-liners could make this movie laughable, except for the grossly offensive and excessive use of violence. To what theatrical end? Who knows.\n\nI cannot say enough bad things about this movie. There may be someone who likes it and tries to indicate some redeeming value can be derived from it. I am not artsy enough, dark enough or deranged enough to agree. I can liken recommending this movie to a friend - the same way one would encourage a non-smoker to pick up a pack of cigarettes.\n\nThere is nothing more to say about this movie except; don\u0027t see it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
