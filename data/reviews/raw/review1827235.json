It turns out this film is more of a remake of I Bury the Living than the Romero film but the producer needed a known title so they borrowed that from Romero. Either way, this film is horrid from start to finish and there\u0027s really nothing worthy in it. I went through some of the extras on the DVD where they talked about the 3D process but as far as I\u0027m concerned these guys didn\u0027t know what they were doing. For starters, there\u0027s only one effect at the very end that comes off in 3D. Yes, I know the technology isn\u0027t the greatest but I\u0027ve seen 3D videos that come off better. Very seldomly do they have anything coming towards the screen and most of the time they have objects moving away from the camera so you can\u0027t get any 3D effect. The story is stupid as well and none of the characters are interesting. Even the zombies come off very lame and their connection to Haig is just pathetic. The cast are all horrible and that sadly includes Haig who adds nothing to the film. The story makes no sense at all and there are so many unanswered questions that you have to wonder if the producer\u0027s ran out of money before everything was shot." }
