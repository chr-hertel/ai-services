The setting is Woody\u0027s beloved Manhattan. There is memorable dialogue. Woody is the intellectual Jew forever questioning himself. Much was made of Keaton\u0027s mannish outfit. It was a mark of women\u0027s liberation but out of step with current disco fashion. I liked the scene where they talk with their thoughts being shown at the bottom of the screen. Christopher Walken is Keaton\u0027s weirdo brother who imagines himself in a head-on collision with an oncoming car. Walken was on the boat the night Natalie Wood drowned. Rumors flew that they were having an affair. I drove into Nashville from Lebanon to see this film and parked along the river. When I came out, my car had been towed. I understood Woody\u0027s contempt for authority. All his films come together here.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
