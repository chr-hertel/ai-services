It follows the story in the book almost to the last word. The very few deviations is of less significance since the story pretty much is the same in spite of them.\n\nTom Hanks delivers, as always, a wonderful performance as Robert Langdon. He really catches the essence of the Harvard professor.\n\nAudrey Tautou is equally as wonderful as Sophie Neveu.\n\nOther than that it is great to see actors such as Jean Reno, Ian McKellen and Paul Bettany deliver great performances in the smaller roles.\n\nI was very surprised to see how great Ron Howard has visualized the popular book and I believe that even Dan Brown would be proud of the film.\n\nAs a final note Hans Zimmer\u0027s music gives The Da Vinci Code the finishing touch and makes the important scenes greater than I had ever imagined.\n\nAll in all a film worth watching.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
