He rubs on the wrong shoulder of a local gangster Dattu (Prakash Raj) leading to death of his mother and losing his love on the scenic land of Kerala. Two years gone by, the chief editor of Andhra Jyothi daily Pallavi (Rakshita) stumbles upon a bottle containing a message which leads to uniting the lost lovers.\n\nMusic:: \"Rama Rama\" stands out. \"Mona Mona\" and \"Yenaatiki\" is hummable.\n\nCinematography:: Good, the backwaters of Kerala captured aesthetically deserves a special mention.\n\nThe movie starts off well however the makers have taken cinematic liberties to the limit and beyond. It would have been better if the protagonist continued to be \"mental\" police officer rather than changing into the profession of fisherman. Nag gets ample scope to display his histrionics and good physique.\n\nI really wonder who is the culprit in Tollywood for inventing two heroines movies and dividing the songs equally amongst them. Anyways, Asin carries herself pretty well with her demure smile and pretty looks in the first-half. Subsequently, she sans 4-inches make up and looks dehydrated college-going lass. The love story of Nag and Asin is cheesy.\n\nRakshita had impressive looks and great costumes. She ensured to get undivided attention of audience by every possible means, barring talent. And the forced love story with Nag justifies the reason the two songs she \"fantasises\".\n\nPrakash Raj\u0027s character is not etched out well. Pronto - he hits the bulls-eye with a knife. Ali is passable. M S Narayana comedy track on the goof-up of mobile number was anything but stupid. Having said that, Asin provides a few laughs as she tries to talk to Nag after losing her voice. The emotional music in the background to cover-up the short-coming only adds to the humour.\n\nPractically speaking, Rakshita sets the cash-register ringing by sensationalising the story of Shivamani and Vasantha in her newspaper, is actually portrayed as a good Samaritan. Whoa!!! \n\nDid I forget to tell you the prerequisite? You ought to safe-deposit your logic and reason at the ticket-counter.\n\nI was informed this movie was a hit back home in Andhra and if that statement holds truth, then the appreciating audience must be having The Flintstones as their neighbours." }
