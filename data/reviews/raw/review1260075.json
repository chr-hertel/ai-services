When it comes to the most difficult operations, he is able to carry it out.\n\nSadly, his life is quite a mess. He and his classmate, Roger Law (played by Alex To) fall for the same girl, but he gives her up because he feels he cannot be a good husband to her. She returns to find him to seek treatment when she is dying of bone cancer. He treats her, but she still dies.\n\nRoger Law is a good surgeon, but not as intelligent as Mack, hence each time Roger has a problem, he seeks advice from Mack. Mack helps Roger although he knows he will not gain any credit from it, but does so because he feels that as a doctor, his duty is always to the patient and to no one else. Roger may be a good surgeon, but he wants the glory for himself. When Roger is given the chance to try and save Professor Bao\u0027s work, he does so to ensure that he gets credit for it, although Bao\u0027s true protégé was always Mack. When Bao dies, Mack gets into trouble with the medical board, and Roger is determined to see that Mack loses his license.\n\nLau Ching Wan does a good job as the police officer Chiu, who is smitten with the prostitute, Mei. He wants to her only customer, and even mistakes Mack as trying to sought her services, when in truth Mack was treating her for womb cancer. Lau\u0027s lovesick character and the things he does to prevent people from seeking Mei are hilarious, but not totally over the top.\n\nChristy Chung provides good eye candy, as Roger\u0027s girlfriend, Jamie who is actually smitten with Mack, and who knows that Mack, not Roger is the true genius behind the medical treatments and surgeries. She actually marvels at Mack\u0027s selflessness as a doctor, providing the homeless with free health-care.\n\nAndy\u0027s rather emotional turn as Dr Sam So who was in love with his patient, Zin (who happens to be Mack\u0027s ex-girlfriend\u0027s sister, and who, as fate would have it, suffers from bone cancer) makes you feel for him. It\u0027s not OTT emotional, but emotional enough to make you feel for him and his difficulty. Actually Zin was supposed to be Mack\u0027s patient, but Mack decided to use Zin as a way of making Sam understand that he has to learn to deal with patients who have little time left.\n\nAlex To did good with his character as Roger Law, given the limited screen time. I wished there was a bit more development with his character, but as the immoral doctor who finally realizes what being a good doctor is all about. His determination to see that Mack loses his license makes you hate him at first, but when he needed an operation, and it was Mack who saved him, Roger learns what being a doctor is all about.\n\nNo prizes for guessing who Tony\u0027s character ended up with! That\u0027s the spoiler!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
