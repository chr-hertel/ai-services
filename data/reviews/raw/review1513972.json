HAPPY CUTE RACCOONS! TURN IT OFF, TURN IT OFF\" Well, let me tell you, the Raccoons are way more then just bunch of goofy animals whose sole purpose was to sell toys. The characters are very well described. Particularly Bert who was in the first 3 movies just a comic relief character without some big purpose, and now he\u0027s the star character, while the original main characters, Ralph and Melisa gone into shadow. I\u0027m only disappointed with Cyril Sneer who was a great villain at the beginning, and throughout the show, they gave him \"Ebenezer Scrooge Treatment\" and eventually he became good. I liked him way more as a bad guy. I also think that the later episodes were not so great as the old ones. The cartoon had transformation from a story of Raccoons as rebels who fought Sneer the evil tyrant, to an entire city made out of forest animals with not very mature and funny stories like it had at the beginning. I liked it more at the beginning. But even with lack of quality through time, this is very great cartoon which totally describes the expression - family TV. The other thing I just have to mention is great music and especially the main themes (the opening one, and \"Run With Us\" song at the end). If you like classic cartoons, this is for you! Watch it, believe me, you won\u0027t disappointed!" }
