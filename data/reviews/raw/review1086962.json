A real boxing match, no one takes a dive, its all guts and glory. But I got to tell you, after watching Jesse and Sergio\u0027s fight I was pretty SHOCK! I had this recorded on my DVR. And if anyone else did check out round six. Jesse had just beat Sergio in round five, but as he seat on his stool getting ready for round seven, his trainer/manager tells him \"Let him have this round\" and Jesse comes out not throwing any punches and give round six to Sergio, just as his corner told him to do. Again, all of you that taped it look at the end of round 5 going into 6. I guess all shows have scripts to follow." }
