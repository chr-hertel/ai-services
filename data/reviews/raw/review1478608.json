People watched it because of her, people talk about it because of her and people judge it far too harshly because of her. \n\nThe film is predictable stuff, but what isn\u0027t? The acting is not that bad, Britney is able to squeeze out empathy in one scene and her character is charming, albeit too syrupy. The film itself doesn\u0027t tread too harsh a territory but it shouldn\u0027t have too. \n\nAnyone else, and people would possibly praise it, and forgive its unoriginality. But then, had this been anyone else, you wouldn\u0027t be reading this.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
