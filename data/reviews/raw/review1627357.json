I think if it was an independent film it would have gained higher votes, but I guess people were expecting more form it.\n\nThis film lacked the \"mistrey\" factor,which Hannibal sequels were known with. In the original film, Hannibal was a smart person who predicted the unique methods of a criminal mind. The character in this film approached his victims directly. I thought he was going to hunt his victims in a smart sneaky ways, but unfortunately simply they kept running into each other.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
