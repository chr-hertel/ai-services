As an older \"kid\" of 39,does anyone remember Charlie\u0027s Grandad as the man who played the 1 armed servant in the 1970\u0027s comedy with Richard O\u0027 Sullivan, Robin\u0027s Nest I think...or was it Man about the House..think the former..\n\nAnyway, not much of a review, more of a reminisce for which I\u0027m sorry, but go see the film, great for kids of all ages from 7 to 77..." }
