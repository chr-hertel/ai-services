The plot and character of Jackie\u0027s movies rarely were criterion for judging them. Most of his movies are funny. Some of them were serious action movies. The director of \u0027New Police Story\u0027 hasn\u0027t decided which side to take, and has mixed both humor and tragic to it.\n\nThe movie starts tragically, with Jackie Chan as a Chief Police Officer loosing his team. This tragic atmosphere supposedly bears throughout the movie abundant with idiotic jokes not fitting this atmosphere. Sometimes it\u0027s like laughing at the funeral.\n\nAlthough the stunts are great as always, and Jacky delivers some good moments, they are blended with exaggerated, unnecessary visual effects. The fight choreography is typical and doesn\u0027t catch the eye more than usual.\n\nThe movie being over two hours long exhibit with a little of fight scenes, and stunt scenes saturated with nonsense talk that clearly spoils the movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
