The \u0027Batman\u0027 comic series has evolved into a adult-orientated crime thriller, pitching cops against crooks and the caped vigilante. The star turn of Heath Ledger (as the Joker) frighteningly transforms a once comical character into a sinister psychopath reminiscent of Silence of the Lambs.\n\nThe technical scope of the film (using IMAX cameras for the opening scenes) is impressive, and the script is scintillatingly up-to-the-mark  far outperforming usual expectations for action films.\n\nThe weak points are that it will be overly long for some viewers. Other than Ledger, the star cast of Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Maggie Gyllenhall is woefully underchallenged; whereas Christian Bale as Batman is less than convincing for someone who should have peak physical and mental alertness, even with a vast array of 007-like gadgets. It should be clear to anyone that director Christopher Nolan (of Memento fame) is more likely to make good blockbusters than original art-house movies such as his early promise showed. But at least they are good blockbusters!\n\nDark Knight succeeds by reaching out to viewers that would not normally go to see a Batman movie  and satisfying them. There are many political and moral subtexts which some viewers will find challenging. This is a definite cut above the average Saturday night entertainment.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
