After seeing the shows with interviews I got anxious to see the movie. \n\nNow that I\u0027ve seen it... I can\u0027t stop singing the musics and remembering the scenes. \n\nA word to Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Julie Walters and Colin Firth they were tremendously good in the movie.\n\nThey are no professional singers but they really surprised me. Specially Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan. \n\nSo I just can say, and using a word from another great movie, Mamma Mia just is: Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.\n\nI\u0027ve seen it twice already, and going for a third view or more.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
