Having seen the later film, \"The Children\u0027s Hour,\" about two teachers accused of lesbianism, I wondered how the 1936 film would measure up. The answer: Brilliantly.\n\nPart of the reason for this is, as Lilliam Hellman, the playwright herself stated - the play isn\u0027t really about lesbianism, it\u0027s about a children\u0027s lie. And the vicious, destructive lie of a child is still central here, though now it concerns the supposed affair of Miriam Hopkins and Joel McCrea, who is engaged to marry Merle Oberon, Hopkins\u0027 partner in a girls school. Another reason for the film\u0027s success is the flawless direction by William Wyler, and last but not least, a sympathetic trio. Hopkins is a standout with her strong, passionate performance.\n\nBonita Granville, the bad seed, is such an evil, blackmailing brat, that I\u0027m sure when 1936 audiences saw Margaret Hamilton slap her, they broke into applause. I nearly did, and I was watching it alone! It\u0027s an unrelenting performance, though she\u0027s such a walking horror show, it\u0027s remarkable anyone believed her in her \"earnest\" moments, which were calculated, as only a monster\u0027s can be! Highly recommended.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
