The magnificent views over the Lake District were tear-inducing, how lucky we Brits are to have such a feast of nature for our senses ! However, the otherwise very versatile and gifted Renee Zellweger was hopelessly miscast in this role - the lead should have gone to Emily Watson. Renee\u0027s English accent is superb, however her delivery is too \u0027crisp\u0027 and \u0027pert\u0027 rather as she played Bridget Jones and she seemed incongruous in the whole Edwardian family set-up....it was unimaginable that she was the daughter of her parents.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
