The very end of this film set off such emotions in me, that I barely remembered I had, yet have experienced as a result of a film so beautiful. However, I did experience them, during this film, which absolutely beautiful. Set in 1944, post civil war Spain, a young girl is relocating to the country side, with her mother, to live with her mother\u0027s recent husband, a Captain in Franco\u0027s Army. Upon moving to his lavish mansion, with it\u0027s many servants (some of whom are in league with the still waning rebels, who are still engaging in combat with the fascist in the local country side), she discovers a fantasy realm richer than her or anyone\u0027s imagination. This realm interconnects with her own personal and familial life so exactly that it appears one and the same. With its many intersection between the real and the imagined, and the constant interblending between the two, the last act of the film leaves you to ponder both tragedy and victory as the events unfold, and bleeding through of both into one magical emotional experience (What I mean to say is that I cried...... a lot.). This movie is one part Schindler\u0027s List, one part Lord of the Rings, one part Beautiful Creatures, one part Brazil, and one part Devil\u0027s Backbone. Guillermo Del Toro has directed a wonderful fairytale, which is certainly not for children, except for adults who are children at heart. Highly recommended for all who love dark fantasy.\n\nP.S. (This is the screenplay that Neil Gaiman wished he wrote)." }
