Some incorporate off-the-wall comedy or horror elements (like Hoot Gibson, Maynard had a wild sense of humor!), but ALIAS THE BADMAN is a gritty, straightforward western with Ken as a ranger posing as an outlaw who is posing as a ranger! Ken has a politically incorrect stuttering sidekick named \"Repeater\" (Irving Bacon), and silent star Frank Mayo is impressive as the crooked town boss who turns the local ranchers against each other. Director Phil Rosen is better-known for his later mysteries and crime films, but he directed many westerns in the early sound period, and he handles the unique Maynard mix of comedy and action and mystery quite well. Maynard looks great here too, unlike in some of his later Columbia and Monogram films. An excellent entry in the Maynard series for Tiffany.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
