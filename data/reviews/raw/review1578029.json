Typified by his line \u0027I just do this to make money\u0027, Machin is likable as he sets up his \u0027Thrift Club\u0027 to entice locals into giving him money so he can purchase goods at a huge discount.\n\nOne of the first entrepreneurs, Machin is a lovable rogue and his story is a fun one to watch. A great British classic which showcases Guinness (one of our best actors) alongside British movie luminaries Glynis Johns, Valerie Hobson, and Petula Clark.\n\nMuch later this story was made into a musical, but sadly that has never yet been filmed. It will be fascinating if that ever makes it to the screen.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
