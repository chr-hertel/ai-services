Their chemistry is great! The whole story made me laugh, cry, sit on the edge of my seat holding my breath just hoping it all worked out...it was awesome! I cannot wait to own this one when it comes out! LOVED IT! LOVED IT! LOVED IT!! The plot was genius really...and the one guy from Napoleon Dynamite, though having a small part, really added to this one...very memorable! I loved the relationships between her sister and her nieces and Loved the ending! I won\u0027t spoil it for you, but it will keep you all wrapped up in the movie until the very end...sweet sweet movie!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
