It deserves all the accolades heaped upon it and yes! Inigo gets all the best lines. Everybody involved is on top form and I cannot praise it highly enough. I have never believed in the theory of auteurism but sometimes you can see someones imprint in a movie. In this case I would credit William Goldman as the creator of original story and screenplay. I confess to being a fan of William Goldman before I saw this movie for his books as much as his screenplays (originals and adaptions) and his book on screenplay writing (Adventures in the Screen trade) is the definitive guide. But as he would agree a great movie is a combination of talents and here everyone is at their best. Watch and enjoy!
