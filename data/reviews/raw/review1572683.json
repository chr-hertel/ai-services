It\u0027s horrible that way. It\u0027s like the 3rd and 4th Home Alone\u0027s.. I mean what were they thinking? Why couldn\u0027t you have just hired the same actress people?! The graphics also sucked, the butterflies in the room were incredibly to fake, if I\u0027m going to see a movie I\u0027d like it to be good. As the quote ahead of mine said, it\u0027s almost as if they\u0027re copying The Princess Diaries 2, and in the world of movies, I think that\u0027s a no no. So all in all my reaction to this movie is that it royally sucked. Bad script, bad acting, and poor choices in actors and graphics.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
