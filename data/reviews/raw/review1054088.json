I watched this movie just two nights ago, and then came to IMDb to see who the other actors were. I believe this is a very good movie, just to see the workings behind a movie being made, the manipulations of the producers, and the fights that take place between the \"stars\", and the director were very interesting, and vicious(verbally)! I thought that Mickey played his part with complete believability, as to how a director would try to keep control of the way he envisions a character acting. As opposed to the way the actor playing the main character, see himself playing the part. This main actor seemed to portray somewhat, characteristics of Mickey Rourke, himself in early roles, and had the same personality conflicts that I have read about between Mickey and directors he was involved with while making his own career faux pas. I kept thinking, wow, is Mickey\u0027s character going to KILL this jerk-off? Then about the actor playing the producer, wow, is Mickey\u0027s character going to KILL this jerk-off? I don\u0027t know why, but I kept thinking that they were going to push the director over the edge. Mickey had made a statement that this was a huge opportunity for his character, to be directing this movie, so I thought that the character was going to snap! He didn\u0027t, and I breathed a sigh of relief when he didn\u0027t. The addition of the real mass murderer character, still alive and in prison, was an exciting insert, because now, his character could interact with the people making the movie of his crimes, and he could (and would) have some input, and also a lot of emotional display to the turns in the plot lines. Not only to his involvement with the way his part was being acted out, but to the way that the actor playing him, lived his own life, outside of the production!! I tell you, it was all very very well thought out and portrayed! By ALL the actors involved with this movie. I had no inkling that there were any \"inside jokes\". Nor anything about a favorite club, and how the whistled tune, or the radio show, alluded to it. Still this film caught my attention, and held it from first frame to last. I graded the actors thusly: Gene Bervoets:A. Jan Decleir: C+ (only because his part was so short). Mireille Leveque: B. Mickey Rourke: B+. Producer Guy: A-.\n\nI am sorry that I don\u0027t remember who played the other parts, I mean what their names were, but I do remember the characters named Bob and Dylan. (How could I not, Bob Dylan is an American Icon)! They were funny and I laughed at that. I remember the actress that played Amy, but her part didn\u0027t really show if she could act or not. So, I didn\u0027t give her any grade. Over all, it was a good film, I would recommend it to anyone, who just likes good films, that have a very rooted plot, and a slick way with the script that is new and humorously done, to all jaded audiences.(Mainly us here in the good ole USofA).", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
