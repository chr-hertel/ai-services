Zeitgeist operates with many facts and some of them can be little far fetched by interpetation however everyone can gather most of the evidence by himself. After watching this document you will realize that if even 50% of what you saw there is true , world is little different place as you tought. \n\nI would not recommend to watch this document : When you don\u0027t physics and anyother sience stuff and rather believe everything what is said on fox news. \n\nWhen you still firmly think that world is 6000 years old(even vatican doesn\u0027t believe that) When you ignore the facts , evidence , and living by corporate culture is sense of your life. \n\nYou certainly doesn\u0027t need to believe everything what is in this document however you should at least watch it because it is certainly worthy to confront your views and conviction to see how strong they are.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
