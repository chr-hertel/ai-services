Perhaps it was this neutral attitude that Dead Man\u0027s Chest was so enjoyable but for even the biggest Pirates or Depp fans are going to be delighted with this.\n\nFrom Jack\u0027s reuniting with the Pearl to the thunderous battle with Davy Jones\u0027 mutinous undead on vivid tropical sands, this is a $200m winner make no mistake because the box office take is going to explode and it only leaves you hungry for more upon it\u0027s cliffhanger crescendo that leaves plenty of questions unanswered and then asks a few more for good measure.\n\nNever before have you desired to be a crusty, barnacled sea-urchin so much!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
