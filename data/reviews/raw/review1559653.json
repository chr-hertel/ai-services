I think that most critics would agree that his films are some of the finest of American directors, but why is this film so good? It seems like a simple answer at first but Welles\u0027 films never have simple reasons for their quality. I think what makes this one of Welles greatest films is three major reasons the editing, the humanness of Welles, and the spectacle that the film creates. The editing gives this film its base and gives the misinterpretation of a documentary feel. I\u0027m not sure why people think this is pre MTV editing, but I would think it has something to do with the switching and fast-paced attitude that the editing offers. I think this editing is just simply documentary editing at its finest because documentary are suppose to give the illusion that it is real events that are being filmed when it is only an interpretation of reality. The humanness of Welles astounds me in this film as well. I think that Welles left in scenes that made him look bad simply to make that movie have a human touch of the director, who had a long history of fantastic films, to make you feel that you are his friend and that the movie is personal. Which I believe that it is Welles\u0027 most personal of all the films he made. The spectacle can only be described by actually watching the film, which if you like art movies, is sure not to disappoint. Welles felt in the film that all art is subjective and easy copied. Find out for yourself if you agree with Welles and this masterpiece of modern cinema.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
