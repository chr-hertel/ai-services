They neither match Hollywood musical standards, neither are they good Bollywood-type interludes.\n\nPoor Acting - Aishwarya overacts and Martin underacts.\n\nTerrible view of India - The way Indian arranged marriage and family systems are shown, I\u0027m really surprised how the Indian cast agreed to act in such a movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
