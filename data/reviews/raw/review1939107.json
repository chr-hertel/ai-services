The first is the story of an affluent upper-middle class family. The second is a story of some down-and-out struggling Romanian migrants, one of whom is fired as the maid of the family when she is suspected of stealing. The third is the collision of these two worlds. Each part has a different aesthetic.\n\nThe Rest of the Night is an ambitious film and Munzi is attempting to weave a web that will attract a wide audience. The affluent story is pure contemporary Italian cinema (at least, what we see of it here). There\u0027s the selfish and demanding husband, there\u0027s the beautiful but fading wife and the cute and spoilt teenage daughter. Perhaps Munzi\u0027s intention is subversive, because this aspect of the film acts like a hook for a conventional audience.\n\nI say \"hook\", because the migrant story is more in the realm of social realism รก la 4 Months, 3 Weeks \u0026 2 Days. Indeed, Laura Vasiliu (Marja, the maid) played the pregnant student seeking an abortion in that film. Dismissed at short notice, Marja in her desperation returns to the low-life. This part of the film is effective, though perhaps there is a lack of subtlety in differentiating the high- and low-lives. Nonetheless, the aesthetics of the bleakness is a welcome change to the bland and mostly middle-class stories that Italy exports.\n\nThese two worlds collide in the film\u0027s third act, and the film\u0027s tone changes to one of a crime drama. For my taste, I don\u0027t think Munzi has been wholly successful in weaving these three stories together. I\u0027d have preferred that he stick to one aesthetic or another. But then, perhaps this is not intended for an art-house audience. I think it works best as a film for mainstream audiences who like quality drama, with a few surprises. As I often say, I prefer a film to take risks and not be completely successful, than one that aims low and succeeds. Munzi has taken risks and this film is worth a look.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
