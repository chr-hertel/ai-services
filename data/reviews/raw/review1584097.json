It has elements of an action picture, but it also tries to be a murder mystery, comedy, and drama. And on all levels... it fails.\n\nThe biggest problem is the ending. The filmmakers set the stage for what could have been one heck of a shoot-out. Instead, it settles for a \"twist\" ending that REALLY disappoints. Many characters sub-plots are left unresolved. It\u0027s one thing to have a consistently bad movie, but having a movie that could have been great and blowing the ending is even worse. I couldn\u0027t believe Joe Carnahan (NARC) directed this picture. Save your money and don\u0027t even rent this one.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
