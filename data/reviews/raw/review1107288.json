The show includes a news summery, usually with Moria Stuart and a weather forecast too. There is also the reviews of the Sunday papers with guests.\n\nThis show is presented by newsreader Peter Sissons, who often stood in for David Frost on his show when he was away.\n\nNews 24 Sunday is usually on at the same time as Breakfast With Frost was." }
