I felt that the film does not do the book justice entirely however the film is remarkable in its own right. There were only 3 major things in the film that were majorly different from the book for me: \n\n1. the cryptex was only one-barrelled. I can\u0027t work out why as it would only add about 10 or 15 to the film\u0027s length, if that and I felt that the first clue was an important part to the story as it shows Sophie\u0027s grandfather\u0027s love for her. \n\n2. Langdon and Sophie need to find information on \"a knight a pope interred\" and where do they go for their information? a mobile phone. I don\u0027t know if the people at Orange had anything to do with it but this didn\u0027t smack of academic for me. Also the scene was bit rushed along for my liking. (also my girlfriend was distraught that they didn\u0027t film at King\u0027s College where she attends Uni!) \n\n3. The ending. It was more fitting for those who haven\u0027t read the book but for me it was far too different from the book\u0027s ending. When they arrive at Roslin it is to be reunited with Spohie\u0027s grandmother and brother. Although we see Sophie\u0027s brother its not mentioned that he is her long lost brother. Also, where did all those people come from?!!? And the chamber in the floor? Not good. As everyone whose watch Tony Robinson in england knows that no one has found an entrance to the vast chamber that was discovered to be lying underneath the chamber.\n\nGood points of the movie include the performances of Paul Bettany and Sir Ian McKellen. Outstanding. Bettany is unrecognisable from the last film I saw him in (Wimbledon)and plays the part of Silas with such enthusiasm and really makes you believe the performance. McKellen just was in his element in the role of Teabing. from the moment he descended the stairs to the moment he was taken away by the police he was amazing. Bringing with him the British wit and humour that Dan Brown had intended with the character.\n\nOverall the film is outstanding and is intended for those who have and who haven\u0027t read the book, a sort of in between so people don\u0027t have to have read the book to understand the plot. It\u0027s a good piece of cinematic work and will definitely be as talked about as much the novel whether it be bad or good. \n\nAn excellent film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
