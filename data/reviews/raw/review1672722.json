Duke Ellis (Richard Dix) is ready to escape until he sees his younger brother Johnny (Tom Brown) is being sent to the same prison. He decides to stay and protect him...but Johnny has a quick temper...\n\nThe acting is just so-so (Dix is the worst offender), the dialogue and violence are pretty tame and this is very dated but it\u0027s still a good drama. It deals fairly realistically with the terrible conditions and doesn\u0027t hold back. Racism is dealt with and there\u0027s even an obviously gay prisoner! There\u0027s nothing shocking or new here by today\u0027s standards but this must have packed quite a punch back in 1932. The only really bad part is the ridiculously happy ending that was so improbable that I was almost laughing! Still, this is worth catching. A 7.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
