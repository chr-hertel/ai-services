I am not a child, and I am not obsessed with Disney. Maybe The Groove isn\u0027t entirely conventional, but it\u0027s without the usual princess and the pauper theme of falling madly in love. It\u0027s not a credible film really, but it is funny, and the characters are comic genius! It is wacky, and is the type of film which you can really quote from. I love it, and I\u0027m glad to see others do too. If you haven\u0027t seen it then rent it immediately! I love Kronk, the dim sidekick of Yzma, and I especially love his shoulder angel and shoulder devil. This film does have slapstick humour, but it pokes fun at everything and everyone, without going too far.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
