In here, we get a few sentences from each of the four main actors: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Claire Danes, Nick Stahl and Kristanna Loken. Only Schwarnegger had anything of interest; the rest just saw, \"Oh, wow, I\u0027m working on a Terminator film!\" Judging from some of the outtakes, the actors playing the two cyborgs - Schwarzenegger and Loken - had the best sense of humor and seemed like the actors having the most fun.\n\nStan Winston, the special-effects wizard of Hollywood, had a surprising statement about the robots used in this movie. \"These are not computer-generated, like you might think,\" he said. \"These are actual robots; the real thing. None of those robots were fake.\" \n\nNow, that\u0027s cool!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
