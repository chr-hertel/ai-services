There were a couple of poignant moments in the film, where he\u0027s fallen in love with the hotel switchboard operator, who refuses to feel sorry for him or even let him \"be a victim\" due to his temporarily incapacitation. So he slowly gets up and stumbles to his feet without the help of his walking canes. Then he would rather go visit a paralyzed child rather than talk to a record exec. The interaction between him and the boy is truly heartwarming. Then, of course he meets up with his ex-girlfriend, and his current girlfriend catches him in the former\u0027s arms. Well, its a somewhat mostly typical romantic story.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
