And there were some very impressive scenes. But ultimately the action wasn\u0027t quite high-level enough to sustain my interest in the face of many plot holes.\n\nThe motivations of the characters didn\u0027t make much sense. The policeman and the bad guy are friends for no reason I can see. I didn\u0027t feel any chemistry in the romance. There is a father-child relationship that doesn\u0027t make any sense. The protagonist is one of those criminals with a heart of gold, except in the first 20 minutes of the film, he does some incredibly ugly stuff I won\u0027t spoil for you. I can\u0027t empathize with a protagonist who\u0027d do that. Some of the comedy with the lead actress fell flat. (You can\u0027t miss her, she the only woman in the entire movie with a speaking role.) A lot of stuff blows up, which is good, I just couldn\u0027t get the plot points out of my mind.\n\nWho should see this film:\n\n-- Action movie lovers only, and then only on a rainy day. If you didn\u0027t like \"Independence Day\" or \"Mars Attacks!\" you won\u0027t like this.\n\n-- Chauffers with a chip on their shoulder I\u0027ll give Transporter a disappointing 5 out of 10.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
