The script editor was probably dead and the director should be. To be honest I didn\u0027t manage to finish this film because about twenty dismal minutes in the sight of the main actress scuttling across the floor like a Shetland pony that has been shot in the ass was too much for me to stomach.\n\nI have never, and I mean never, seen a film as sweaty as this one and I watch tons of crap films.\n\nTurd.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
