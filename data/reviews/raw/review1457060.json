Quebec Rating:18+(should be 13+) Canadian Home Video Rating:R(should be 18A)\n\nI have seen Fast Times At Ridgemont High 3 times already and I must say this film is great!Along with Dazed and Confused and American Pie Fast Times at ridgemont high ranks as one of my favorite teen comedies.Teen comedies need to be more like this film!Sean Penn has done plenty of serious roles its funny to see him as a funny stoner in this film.There is no real plot to the movie and the acting isn\u0027t all that great but it accurately shows teenagers and the film is really funny.That\u0027s what makes a great teen comedy.The film just shows the lives of a couple of California teenagers and the misadventures they encounter.Fast Times At Ridgemont High is a hilarious teen comedy.One of the best ones out there! \n\nRuntime:90min \n\n10/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
