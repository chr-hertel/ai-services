Leif Andrée\u0027s superb performance as a slimy lawyer is simply hilarious. I haven\u0027t laughed so much seeing a Swedish movie since \"Tillsammans\". \n\nThe fact that these guys manage to make a movie that is far superior to most of the works by the more established directors in Sweden in 2004 with practically no money says a lot about the climate in our provincial country. Let gifted young directors like these do a movie with the same budget as \"Tre Solar\" instead of throwing away money to has-beens, and bring some life to Swedish movie!\n\nNiklas Boknäs", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
