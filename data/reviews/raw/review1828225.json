However, one of them isn\u0027t the best representative of the faith because he ends up sleeping with one of his potential converts--leading to a very sticky (and funny) situation.\n\nI won\u0027t attack this film like one of the other nominations, though I can see how they might be upset that the film definitely makes fun of some religious people, though I don\u0027t think it can be categorically said that the film targets Mormons. The characters do seem rather like the Mormons, though no mention is made of Mormons, The Book of Mormon and the missionaries only carry the Bible and refer to their leader as \u0027pastor\u0027. So this might be seen as a general attack on religion or Christianity instead of Mormonism.\n\nMy advice, then, is that if this might offend you, then watch a different film. However, despite the film\u0027s tone towards religion, it is very well written and directed--as well as being very clever. It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Live Action Short for 2006 but lost to the amazing WEST BANK STORY.\n\nThese and many more are included on the DVD \"A Collection of 2006 Academy Award Nominated Short Films\" and is well worth buying because it is jam-packed full of 13 wonderful shorts.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
