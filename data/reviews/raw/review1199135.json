I remember finding this game in my brother\u0027s collection, and I was attracted to the artwork on the cover. My brother didn\u0027t trust me with his PS1 at the time, so it took forever to finally convince him to let me play. I remember sleepless nights of sweat dripping down my forehead playing that game; we had no air conditioning upstairs yet. I remember not even knowing what an RPG was until this game. This is my favorite RPG of all time. I love it and will never give it away. I love the artwork, the storyline, the characters, the graphics (even if they are outdated), the side-quests, the mini-games, and the responsibility of finding all 108 characters. All in all, this is a great game. A classic that will be forever enjoyable to play. In fact, I still play it even after I beat it." }
