After all, if the basic Pyramus and Thisbe romance can be remade and reworked a hundred different ways, why shouldn\u0027t Bennet and Darcy? Aldous Huxley\u0027s screenplay is razor sharp, the plot gallops along, the characters are wisecracking and witty, and though I have probably watched this film more often than any other film I own, It still feels fresh and surprisingly modern. Only \u0027His Girl Friday\u0027 can best the deliciously quick dialog Huxley penned for his female lead.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
