No one got off scot free! It happened, we were arrogant and thought we were untouchable! Well, we were not only touched, but had the wind knocked out of us! \n\nClinton made mistakes, Bush Sr made mistakes, Reagan made mistakes and Carter REALLY made mistakes... why does anyone think our current president wouldn\u0027t make a few himself? \n\nIt\u0027s obvious that there were a few characters that were blended together and made into one... the Donnie Wahlberg character for one. But, the basic meaning of the movie was to slap us into reality... we were hit once and could be again if we don\u0027t learn from our past mistakes!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
