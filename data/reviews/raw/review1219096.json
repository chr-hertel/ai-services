He is second in my book only to Jeremy Brett (except Howard has better hair, rather curly, which I found attractive).\n\nThe writing and dialogue was well done and charming. Howard and Crawford play off each other beautifully, and obviously enjoy their roles.\n\nSome of the camera angles in this show are awful, but only add to the comedy (at least to me). It seemed a little too obvious at times that some actors were shot independently of the rest of the scene, and jumped places.\n\nIn short I laughed a lot at it all, and loved every minute of it. If you haven\u0027t, go buy this show." }
