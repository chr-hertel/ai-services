You didn\u0027t know what was going to happen next. I love the twist at the end. It\u0027s unreal how the girl that barely made it out alive in part one became a part of the horror in part two. High ratings for this one. I would recommend anyone watch this movie. You will jump out of your seat. I think that the characters did a wonderful job of sticking with the part they were supposed to play. I can\u0027t believe that Donnie didn\u0027t make it out alive. That was sad considering that he tried so hard to save his son. His son was saved but he didn\u0027t make it. There some of the characters that I did not recognize but they all did a fine job during this movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
