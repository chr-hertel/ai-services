But for TP laughter is a tool to help convey a message. There is no real secret here as to what the message is. It runs through all the plays, it runs through Diary of A Mad Black Woman, and although I haven\u0027t gotten to see the movie of Madea\u0027s Family Reunion yet, I\u0027m willing to bet it runs through that as well.\n\nTyler Perry is a dedicated Christian, and that is the message of his work. The teachings of Jesus are filtered through Madea and her wild family, and although Madea says repeatedly that she\u0027ll be seen in church \"when they get a smoking section,\" she is the mortar which binds the family together.\n\nTyler Perry is probably the most talented man in the film industry today.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
