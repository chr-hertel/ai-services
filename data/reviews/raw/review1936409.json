The premise is interesting, two paramedics are \"abducted\" into a suicide cult of sorts and must get away before it\u0027s too late for them.\n\nThere\u0027s a layer of religion (also seen in movies like \"Frailty\") that is really the crux of the movie - which makes us question the true motives behind religious preachers, missionaries and insane cults, as well as presenting us with an atheist point of view. \n\nThe ending is the movie\u0027s strongest point, and it again poses the viewers with an important question. Myrick seems to like to ask more question than answers in his movies and \"Believers\" is no exception. This is a low-budget flick best seen with low expectations.\n\n5/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
