For instants the director Nick Cassavetes and actors gave their best towards this movie. Even though there is nothing really special about this film, it touched me: the simplicity and the beautiful way it was filmed..\n\nThe best part of the film where the performances of the different actors making the film therefor quite believable. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams really succeeded in giving a good-to-watch-performance. The old Noah and Allie (Tim Ivey and Gina Rowlands) had an important role and gave a extremely believable and absolutely brilliant performance.\n\nEven though I don\u0027t think Rachel McAdams (young Allie) was the right actor for her role, I found her to be quite good and believable. Especially when she was acting a teenage girl. Ryan Gosling I a different matter, I think he was just the right choice for his part. He did really well in acting a teenager and the later a more mature man. Brilliant work from both the actor Ryan Gosling (young Noah) and the director Nick Cassavetes.\n\nI personally watch tons of movies and I often like them even though many might say I sucks. I don\u0027t actually even like love stories that much, but the Notebook brought to my mouth these words; This movie has been done out of love towards movies. \n\nMy opinion is still quite simple: It\u0027s mostly just a good-old, ordinary love story with a nice touch to it.\n\nThe film succeeded in being the film that it was suppose to be. Well made and worth a watch at least from DVD, TV or cable..", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
