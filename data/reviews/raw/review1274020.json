It certainly did mine. After all, since when was Pamela Anderson known to be a comedic attraction? I mean she HAS been an attraction for many years now, but not once for humor-related reasons. Many times, it\u0027s very difficult for humans to let go of prejudgments or prejudices, and I am no exception. To be honest, the first moment I heard Pamela Anderson was in a sitcom I thought, \"Hmm, I give it a week\". Hopefully, and very hopefully, this is nowhere close to what will happen. If audiences give Stacked just one chance, I feel the show will stay on the air for a very long time. And that\u0027s the first reason to be excited about this show: it\u0027s a lot, lot better than you thought it would be. Forget your prejudgments. Forget anything about Pamela. This show is very funny. It\u0027s very, very funny. It\u0027s no \"Scrubs\" yet, but it\u0027s surely on the right path. That\u0027s the first reason to be excited about this show: it\u0027s funny, a lot funnier than you would expect it to be. From the very first few episodes, the show steered clear from the usual cliché\u0027s that many new shows have to start with as some sort of much-unneeded TV ritual. The show is a bit original in its plots, which is hard to say these days. Case in point: the episode about being a \u0027groupie\u0027 and being \u0027passed around\u0027. Interesting, and funny.\n\n(2) The second reason to be excited about this show is that Elon Gold, one of the primary cast members, finally has a show to star in. If you\u0027re not familiar with Elon, I advise you not to miss any chance to see his standup comedy routines. I\u0027ve seen him only ONCE on the Tonight Show and he had me rolling on the floor with laughter. His material was excellent and his impersonations of David Schwimmer and Jeff Goldblum should not be watched by those who had any recent abdominal surgeries. I feel he\u0027s going to be a major comedy star one day. And this is the perfect start to spring from.\n\n(3) The third reason to be excited about this show is a \u0027new\u0027 cast member I\u0027ve never seen before: Brian Scolaro. This is the first time I\u0027ve ever seen him, and I would be surprised if someone blamed me for prejudging sitcom newcomers as mostly amateurish, predictable and overly self-burdened with one cliché after another. This guy is totally awesome. He\u0027s an amazing deadpan comedian. Personally, it\u0027s slightly annoying if a sitcom comedian smiles as he/she delivers the line. A serious face (especially when delivering an annoyed, sad or fearful line), a deadpan face, that\u0027s good comedy. And he makes you laugh with his deadpan face (since he\u0027s annoyed and harassed most of the time by the unfairness of life, the old guy, and other things) as much as he does with his well-written lines (a classic already is the last line in the \u0027Groupie\u0027 episode).\n\nMy advice to all you TV, comedy, sitcom, whatever fans out there: watch...this...show. You\u0027ll be pleasantly surprised." }
