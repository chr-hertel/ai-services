Unlike the original with Hayley Mills, there is deep conflict in this film between Russell and Stevens who battle over controversial ideas.\n\nI loved the song that is played throughout the film. It\u0027s the title of the movie. I enjoy the syncopation that arrives with the word follows.\n\nVan Johnson, Arthur Godfrey, Milton Berle and Robert Taylor briefly appear before and during the trip of the students and faculty of St. Francis to an inter-faith youth rally in California.\n\nToo bad that the rally itself is never shown. It would also have been nice to see Hayley Mills in this sequel.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
