However, while watching it one Christmas, (at about age ten or eleven) I experienced an epiphany of sorts, and came to realize just what a wonderful telling of Dickens\u0027 tale this rendering, in particular, actually was. I have watched it every Christmas since.\n\nChristmas is many things, tradition being among them. It is like a warm, wonderful dream in the middle of winter. This film has the age to establish tradition and the real sense of another time, and it\u0027s black-and-white, less than perfect visual qualities help to make it dream-like, working in it\u0027s favor, from my perspective.\n\nI have heard Addinsell\u0027s score on the radio. The music is able to stand apart, on it\u0027s own merits. I don\u0027t think that this could be said of any other (excepting, perhaps, the musical) film version.\n\nAnd then, of course, there are the actors. The story is set in nineteenth century England. Native actors would thereby seem the best choice for believability. Besides, nobody does character roles as well as the British. George C. Scott seemed wooden when he played Scrooge. Reginald Owen, a caricature. Alastair Sim, on the other hand, WAS Scrooge. His portrayal was not only realistic, but emotionally complete and satisfying. I loved Leo G. Carroll as Topper, but as Jacob Marley\u0027s ghost, he was flat. When Michael Horndern played the role, you felt his torment. He was wonderful. And so may the same be said for the rest of the cast of the 1951 British version.\n\nAn opinion similar to my own seems to be held by virtually everyone with whom I have discussed \"Scrooge\". A hundred years from now, people will still be deriving the same pleasure from it that I have. This is the true test of what may truly be called \"a classic\"." }
