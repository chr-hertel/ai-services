Its neither a right or a privilege for writers or critics.", "reviewBody": "Trust the Man finds an audience for romantics who want a refreshing breather from sensationalism, graphic content,crude language, and critic bashing. Freundlich earns its trust with sensitive glimpses of life, love, and adult humor. Critics fail to recognize that many viewers like feel-good endings, and the \"predictible\" reality of couples who try to make relationships work. Freundlich writes with heart and sensitivity and knows the difficult task of earning trust. The films stellar cast plays off their different strengths and weaknesses. Maybe writers,critics,actors,audiences and studios could also play fair game where respect, professionalism and trust should be earned and equal to the price of admission.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
