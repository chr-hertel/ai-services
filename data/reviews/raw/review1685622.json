Even when i first saw the poster of this movie, i didn\u0027t really interested in it. But, when the trailer comes out, i expected it would be great. And when i saw it, i realize that it\u0027s more than great. It\u0027s amazing.\n\nFor people that wasn\u0027t really \"Transformers\u0027s\" fans, i think, as long as you like fantasy-action movie, you\u0027ll like this one too. Like me! The point is this movie can take many new fans, not only the \"old\" fans. And when some people say only boys will like it, they were totally wrong. Even if you\u0027re a girl, you will still amazed by this movie.\n\nIt\u0027s also amazing how they can manage to combine the computer work and the real work. The actors are also amazing. It\u0027s amazing how they can act like the robots are really there, while they weren\u0027t.\n\nIt wasn\u0027t really surprising to know that this movie is amazing. Why? Because it directed \u0026 produced by two of the greatest director \u0026 producer i know, Michael Bay \u0026 Steven Spielberg.\n\nI highly recommended this to any Tranformers fans or non-fans, especially a fantasy-action movie fans. I think if you like movie such as Power Rangers or Star Wars, you\u0027ll like this movie too.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
