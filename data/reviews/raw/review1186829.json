The cast features many fan-favorites, including Nao Takagi (Sailor Uranus), Asami Yuhka (Sailor Neptune), and Hikari Ono (Demand). The songs chosen for the musicals are some of the more popular songs, including Innocent Demand, Tuxedo Versus, FIRE, and Set Me Free ~Hitomi wa Sore He~. The story line is simple and easy to follow (not like some of the other musicals). The acting, singing, and dancing is one of the cast\u0027s best performances. If you\u0027re looking to get into the Sailormoon musicals, this is a good place to start. I would also recommend checking out some of the first stage musicals, such as Gaiden, Dark Kingdom Fukkatsu Hen, or Eien Densetsu.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
