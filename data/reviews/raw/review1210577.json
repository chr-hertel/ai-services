It features Emmeline Pankhurst, great militant suffragist and leader of the English Forces. Harriet Stanton Blatch, President of the Women\u0027s Union, New York City, and her co- workers for the \"cause\" have all taken an active part in the presentation of their work to gain political equality.\n\nA campaign film for the \"Votes of Women\" movement which surveys everything which is wrong with society and which guarantees the elimination of all social evils if women are granted the right to vote.\n\nThe political boss, his control over the courts, and the necessity for a young lawyer to follow his dictates are clearly shown. You see the way that elections are won by fraud, the packing of the ballot boxes, and the registering of \"repeaters.\"\n\nA rather slight story background shows a young lawyer who does not see the justice of the campaign and tells of his sweetheart who works with Emmeline Pankhurst and other leaders of the cause.\n\nAn intriguing story of love, intrigue and clever detective work, in which the power of a modern political boss is challenged by the \"fair suffragette,\" and after a hard fight, in which her lover is involved, she succeeds in defeating the political gang. This is a picture with punch that although filmed in 1913 still leaves a big impression.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
