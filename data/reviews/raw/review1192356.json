This legendary film was filmed in 1994. During filming, Brandon Lee died on the set. I felt sorry for him. He extremely made the character Eric Draven. He put all his emotion into this role. This movie is very violent, but it is really touching at the end. I remembered at that time in the movie theater, over half people cried for the ending. Sometimes, sadness can be beautiful. This dark-Gothic-style in this movie is excellent. The director Alex Proyas did an excellent job, even better than that in his latter movie \"I, Robot\". After 6 years, I understood that this movie actually came from comic book. I think this could be the best movie adapted from comic book I have ever seen, even better than another movie I like \"Spider Man\". Actually, this story is an ordinary revenge story. However, the excellent setting, great directing, touching music and -as everyone knows- the extraordinary acting by Brandon Lee make this film become not merely a movie. I know there are lots of people crazy for this movie. Brandon Lee totally dedicated himself to this role, to this movie. This is the movie I can see again and again. This is a beautiful sad story. The is the best movie adapted from comic book during the 90\u0027s." }
