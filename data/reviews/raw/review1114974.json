WHOA! \u0027That is a must-see crappy movie!\u0027, I said. And indeed it was. Only a lot lot worse. It is very difficult to see all the movie - stuffed with some religious thoughts, ridiculous zombie-like monsters, who serve Satan, all the idea of a plot set in some forgotten community, which represent whole mankind - it is a load of Christian fundamentalist\u0027s wet dreams.\n\nI\u0027ve nothing against Christianity, even in the movies, but this one lacks taste, it lacks almost everything that connects with a common sense, c\u0027mon, Chuck Norris playing an ANGEL, whose job is to look after little town, where Satan lives?!?! The whole plot is so damn straight and boring, not mentioning its silliness (yes, it\u0027s not stupidity anymore, we\u0027re talking silliness like... like a retarded child\u0027s joke) make altogether terrible movie, made as far as I suppose for elder people very much devoted to Catholic Church, because young viewers laugh at almost every scene. Technically it\u0027s incorrect, the fx are worse than the ones you\u0027ve seen in early 90\u0027s in TV series, the plot seems VERY stupid, actors could be easily exchanged to cardboard stands, not mentioning the music which as far as I\u0027ve heard was played on a childish toy piano. I\u0027ve seen a lot of movies, even the worst ones (the ones from the IMDb bottom list) like \u0027Space Mutiny\u0027 or \u0027Manos - hands of fate\u0027 BUT believe me nothing compares to this ridiculous, terrible, horribly acted quasi-movie which brings some students\u0027 prank movies to my mind rather than regular production. Avoid it. At all cost avoid it. There\u0027s even nothing to laugh at. Chuck Norris has officially finished his movie career.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
