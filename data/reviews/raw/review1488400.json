I\u0027m not sure why since there\u0027s none of the suspense, mystery, atmosphere or other qualities that made the series such an enduring hit. There is, however, a rather delicious irony (no pun intended) that comes to a humorous climax in a slow forward dollying shot ending with a big close-up of Bel Geddes. Hitchcock himself directed the show and that same dollying technique is repeated to great effect in the final shot of Tony Perkins in Psycho. \n\nAnyway, my favorite part is where Allan (Rocky) Lane tells wife Bel Geddes that he\u0027s leaving her. Her face suddenly registers a complete blank as she goes into denial that this could be happening. It\u0027s a rather inspired little moment and a tribute to Bel Geddes\u0027s acting skill. Notable also for presence of hawk-nosed Harold J. Stone as a senior cop and ex-cowboy star Lane as the faithless husband. Otherwise, it\u0027s a routine episode, at best." }
