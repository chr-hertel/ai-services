Now, this is obviously not some all time greatest movie of all time or anything like that, but it really is a well made film, and a good horror film. Considering that I only watch horror movies, and every review I\u0027ve done on IMDb has been extremely negative of really horrible horror films (hence my name) this being the first positive review I\u0027ve given is really saying something, at least for me anyway :) In The Final Conflict, our hero (or rather not I guess, since he IS the anti-Christ) Damien is all grown up and using his demonic ways to basically take over the world for Satan. The one melodramatic scene where he gives his little speech to his father Satan is pretty stupid and could have done without (although the scuptlure of Christ in that scnece is actually a pretty amazing work of art), but other than that this is a fine horror film. The atmosphere is great, decent performances. His scene with the president (played by Mason Adams) makes you chuckle and ties in so well how all politicians (as well as everything to do with politics) are so deeply in league with Satan.\n\nA couple shocking violent scenes, really creepy atmosphere, great cinematogrpahy - this film is clearly from an analogue age, before digital anything was in use. Perhaps this is part of the reason many don\u0027t like this movie, today\u0027s horror films are a lot easier to make due to digital advances (which is a good thing) so they appear to have high production quality, but are really terrible made, written and directed. The final conflict is well made, and of course the score by Jerry Goldsmith is excellent and adds much to the film, definitely would have been a worse movie without his score, I can\u0027t say enough how good it is. The mix of very old musical ideas with modern ones, (as well as a few tritones of course) really makes the movie in many ways for me.\n\nSo see The Final Conflict if your a horror fan.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
