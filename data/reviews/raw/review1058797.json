His rude personality is a laugh as he attempts to save the battling restaurants from closure. The show appears to be aimed at reality TV fans that may have an interest in food and beverage and the Hospitality Industry.\n\nI think the show provides an interesting insight into what happens behind the scenes at restaurants including the stress on the staff and the common mistakes made by the kitchen staff particularly. I feel that the show expanded my knowledge by highlighting the importance of teamwork in a restaurant and what can happen if this is not done. Since a lot of the show is filmed during busy hours of the restaurant the viewer gets to see how the kitchen operates and how fast passed everything is.\n\nWe Lent about the importance of communication within the workplace in class and Ramsay\u0027s kitchen nightmares provided an educational link by showing students how any restaurant could be a disaster with out efficient communication. My conclusions of the show are very good. It\u0027s great to see a new type of TV chef that doesn\u0027t just stand in front of the camera cooking meals all the time. Gordon Ramsay has a very rude personality that is stereotypical or the \"grumpy chef\", but it makes for a very entertaining show." }
