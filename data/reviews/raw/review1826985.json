I became a fan of Sweeney after seeing the wonderfully amazing 2007 version (I WILL review that), and this was the 2nd Sweeney I\u0027ve seen, and I\u0027ve never been disappointed yet except for the atrocious camera work in the 1979 version.\n\nNow you guys already know the plot, so I won\u0027t give anything away. But anyways, here\u0027s my breakdown of some of the cast: GEORGE HEARN as SWEENEY TODD: Awesome!!!!! He was much better than Johnny Depp... and Depp\u0027s my favorite actor (Depp did an amazing job in the movie though, keep in mind). I couldn\u0027t believe my eyes and ears. His singing is perfect, and so is his acting! PATTI LuPONE as LANDLADY MRS. LOVETT: The best Mrs. Lovett I\u0027ve seen. She did an amazing job. Throughout she kept me captivated, and I loved it.\n\nNEIL PATRICK HARRIS as TOBEY RAGG: Good performance, especially in \"Not While I\u0027m around\".\n\nDAVIS GAINES as ANTHONY: Great performance! Especially when he sings \"I have sailed the world and seen its wonders...\", that\u0027s when you know he\u0027s awesome from the beginning.\n\nVICTORIA CLARK as the BEGGAR: Great!!!!! I felt like they actually used an actual beggar for her role.\n\nI will leave the rest for you to see, but I was amazed by this Sweeney adaptation. Watch it!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
