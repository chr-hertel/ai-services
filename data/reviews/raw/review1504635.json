This documentary revolves around the excellence of Ruben\u0027s life and his poetry as well as the outstanding band that he leads -- Seis Del Solar. It begins with Ruben at his Harvard graduation and gets better and better. As a absolute fan of this master, I was impressed by the choice of visual landscape, he shows his accomplishment, his parents, his town in Panama, the city life in Panama while cutting to his performance of songs from his landmark album \"Buscando America.\" This album helped me return to listen to the fabulous musical arrangements and lyrics of Latin music. I did not appreciate much of what was being done in the early 80s in Latin music, but this man\u0027s words turned me around. He reads (in English) the lyrics to songs like \"Todos vuelven,\" and \"Buscando America\" and they read as lovely in English as they sound in Spanish with a melody. I can only aspire to be as gifted and talented as this man and my son is now a great fan. We love Ruben and I\u0027m surprised I just got around to seeing this fabulous documentary. If you love Ruben, are interested in learning more about his incredible life and dedication to human causes, his poetry and music, then you MUST CHECK THIS OUT. I am more inspired and am searching for everything else that may be out there by him. I write this as I listen to Mar De Sur from the Tiempos album, another masterpiece!!! (Sicarios is chilling!! -- hoy cambiara su vida!!!) Love you Rube!!! You make us all proud!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
