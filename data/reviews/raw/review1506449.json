Unfortunately, one of my selections happened to be Red Riding Hood.\n\nFirst and foremost, the music in this film is quite possibly the worst I have ever seen used in any motion picture, mainstream or independent. The director had selected a 2 minute long show tune musical number that repeats the same lines at least a dozen times throughout the movie. It\u0027s as if he has an effeminate brother-in-law aspiring to a Broadway career. Absolutely terrible and pointless... by far the worst use of music in any motion picture that I have ever seen.\n\nThe repetitive and annoying music would have been bad enough on it\u0027s own to ruin a good movie, but Red Riding Hood is FAR from even being a halfway decent flick. It stars a little girl who may one day may grow up to be a decent actress, but as of the filming of Red Riding Hood, she has a long way to go before she sounds like anything above what you would expect at a middle school play. The grandmother delivers a good performance, and is just about the only watchable character you\u0027ll find. As far as my tastes, I can handle the bad acting. It\u0027s the predictable and boring plot that ruins this one for me.\n\nIn the interest of not posting spoilers, I won\u0027t talk about the \"twist\" at the end, if you can call it that, but I will say that the only way you won\u0027t see it coming by the first 20 minutes is if you have fallen asleep from boredom. Death scenes are unimpressive and one scene of violence is lifted directly from Misery.\n\nMaybe it wasn\u0027t quite 90 minutes long, but sitting through this movie felt like an eternity. I want at least 90 minutes of my life back... possibly more for the time it took me to explain to others just how bad this movie really is.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
