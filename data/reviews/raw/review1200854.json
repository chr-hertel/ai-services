The introduction to the squad was promising with names with \u0027Reaper\u0027 \u0026 \u0027Destroyer\u0027. But the film manages to go directly to the dumper. We are immediately subjected to low budget corridor creeping with the actors ineffectually sweeping their guns around and waiting to be carried off by monsters unknown and uninteresting. The beginning is thus sort of a low budget Aliens sequel. The film goes from bad to worse as the producers decide to add a plot twist to a movie with little plot. The set design is either ugly, uninteresting, or (practically) non-existent as little creative effort was put into it or the writing. The actors try their best but the whole film is a failure. This is definitely one film which should not have taken itself seriously. The least they could have done is change the name when they decided to make such a poor film.\n\nThe good news is that any future remake couldn\u0027t possibly be worse than this, that is, if anyone goes to see it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
