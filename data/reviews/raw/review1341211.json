If not, then I\u0027m baffled. As my friend said, \"There went ninety minutes that I\u0027ll never get back.\"\n\nThe best part of the film is the title sequence, which was very slick and set the right suspenseful mood. After that, things went quickly downhill. The acting is workmanlike, the script is full of clumsy dialogue, and the direction is riddled with embarrassing clich√©s. (For instance, during the final showdown, which of course takes place in a dark house during a thunderstorm, we are treated to a flash of lightning suddenly revealing the silhouette of someone on the doorstep -- twice!) \n\n\"Keep Your Distance\" tries to be a character-driven suspense film, but the problem is that the characters are insubstantial and unlikable and there is no suspense. I knew who the culprit was from the beginning, simply due to Ebert\u0027s \"law of economy of characters,\" but I didn\u0027t know why. At the end of the film, I still didn\u0027t know why. The clues that we are given, when they are finally deciphered by the characters, turn out to be mostly irrelevant.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
