It seemed inevitable that he would eventually star in an \"Exorcist\" spoof. What makes \"Repossessed\" especially eye-opening is that it\u0027s got Linda Blair spoofing her own famous role. So, as they just want to be as goofy as possible, much of the humor revolves around projectile vomiting (you\u0027d better have a strong stomach for this one). Aside from that, they poke fun at what were then current events, namely with Ned Beatty as a Jim Bakker-resembling clergyman; there\u0027s also Oliver North having a memory problem, Sean Penn having a short temper, and a little something about Morton Downey. Oh, and of course they admit that they\u0027re in a movie at one point.\n\nYes, it\u0027s basically low humor, but they\u0027re not afraid to do whatever they want. You gotta love this one. And the next time that someone asks \"May I?\", you know what to say.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
