It is such a fun, cute, heartwarming story of NYC kids taking competitive ballroom dancing in their schools. I hope it wins an Oscar for best documentary!! It is so great to be able to go to a movie that is interesting and fun and doesn\u0027t contain violence, sex or craziness. I didn\u0027t think they made movies like this anymore. I hope that everyone in U.S.A. hears about MHB and goes to see it. It would be especially good for teachers of kids 11-12 years old to take their class to. I highly recommend that. The audiences have been clapping, cheering, laughing and at the end, all are standing watching the ending trailers. It\u0027s really great. Good Luck Mad Hot Ballroom!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
