You also need to know something of Mexico\u0027s culture, and be able to understand it. If you\u0027ve never been further than 10 miles from your home and went to the same school for twelve years, you will not like or understand this movie. I have lived in Mexico for two years, and I understood and loved the movie. This movie is in no way prejudice, as it is a COMEDY, and it is for the use of entertaining more than persuading. I also think that one needs to be accepting of the movie, and wanting to give it a chance before they will like it. This is why I enjoyed this movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
