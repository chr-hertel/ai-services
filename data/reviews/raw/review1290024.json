Though critics often prefer the earlier \"My Pal Trigger\" to \"The Golden Stallion,\" fans may prefer the latter. Dale Evans adds just the right touches as the sweetheart Stormy. Both Roy and Dale show their deep love and affection for horses which makes this one a must for kids of all ages. Roy and Dale, though having other mates earlier in life, were made for each other. No married couple in the entertainment field except possibly Burns and Allen were so compatible and so loved by their many fans. For me, this is the best of the Roy and Dale films.\n\nPat Brady, who replaced a young fellow in the musical group The Sons of the Pioneers named Leonard Slye when he became Roy Rogers, is around for the laughs. Pat had a winning personality and was a great singer but not really much of a comedian, though he did have a funny moniker this go around as Sparrow Biffle. His jeep Nellie Belle upstages him. When an inanimate object gets the most laughs, a comic should take notice.\n\n\"The Golden Stallion\" is in Trucolor which this time adds to the overall beauty and highlights the golden in the title. Even non-Roy Rogers fans should enjoy this cinematic gem.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
