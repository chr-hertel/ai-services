I really love Brittany even in her other films like Just Married for me she\u0027s one of Hollywood\u0027s Gem because in her portrayal as the nanny of Dakotta she is absolutely Adorable and worth crying for. Dakotta have also done impressive acting, she is amazing, very great performance.This is truly an excellent Heartwarming Comedy!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
