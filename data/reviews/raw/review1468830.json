The only thing that keeps your attention is Sharon Stone\u0027s hot 50 year old body --which you don\u0027t get to see until the final few scenes. The movie ends so ridiculously that you wish you hadn\u0027t watched it to begin with. This movie is about as good as the first which doesn\u0027t say much. It\u0027s nothing to be remembered except for a 50 year old\u0027s body who looks like she\u0027s 30. Need plastic surgery or a cool haircut? Rent this movie. Want to watch a good movie? Don\u0027t rent this. It\u0027s a waste of 4 bucks and even a bigger waste if you buy it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
