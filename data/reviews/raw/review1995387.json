So - about comedy aspect - there is none... or one. I had something similar to a laugh just once while watching the movie, once!! this is a new anti-record for these type of movies. I am really waiting in excitement what will be the next BIG THING that Hollyywood will bring in this terrible-parody sub genre (i am not kidding, for real!) So that\u0027s about the comedy aspect of \"Disaster Movie\" (this is where it got it\u0027s 0.5 mark out of 10). \n\nnow to the positive thing i mentioned in the headline - this movie can be used as a reference guide to the top hit movies of this year and those that can be put on to-watch list. It\u0027s more like an hour long ad, than a movie. And some parody scenes are quite good example/interpretations of pop-life based events for the last-and-past years. And this is where it gets another mark - i even give one whole point out of 10 (now totaling 1,5/10).\n\nThrully disastrous movie, but it\u0027s what you asked for if you wanted to watch it ;)\n\nPS. where did it get the last 0.5points? for the ending song which is a rather good parody for the default pop songs that engulf the charts.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
