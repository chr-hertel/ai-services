James Spader conveys this curiosity and channels his quest to discover the gate\u0027s secrets to the audience. Lindfors is also very good as an elder scientist who feels Spader is the answer to all the questions. Kurt Russell\u0027s range as a military officer is limited here; he\u0027s introduced as suicidal due to his son\u0027s recent death, but is quite stoic and just grim throughout. He\u0027s obviously a \u0027can do\u0027 soldier and leader, but also anticipates his later robotic fighter in \"Soldier\" 4 years later. After the action moves off Earth to what\u0027s on the other side of the gate, our anticipation to find out what\u0027s there is rewarded by little more than a variation on \"Dune\"(84) done in more formulaic style.\n\nA formula is what partners Emmerich and Devlin present, as is always the case in their movies - successful formulas, to be sure, but nothing to get surprised over. Even if you know nothing about one of their films beforehand, about 20 minutes in you may have it all figured out. Here, the expedition finds a \u0027desert\u0027 world and are soon expected to help the natives against an alien tyrant (Jaye Davidson, his unusual persona taken advantage of). Are we all surprised by such a plot? Of course not. The special FX are pretty impressive, especially the shots of the huge flying pyramid and some of the landscapes. They also have some impressive crowd shots which add to an epic scale of storytelling. But, there\u0027s very little emotional attachment to the unfolding struggle - it\u0027s all by the numbers and even Spader can\u0027t inject much feeling into any of it. The next project, \"Independence Day\" was probably more successful because our own cities were being destroyed, not some far-off planet we care very little about.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
