I need to get out of here!\" As I don\u0027t make a habit of renting movies that don\u0027t have action, gore, nudity etc, you know, a GUY\u0027S flick! However she put the film on, and I really couldn\u0027t be arsed getting out of my chair, and I had a cold beer with me, so how bad could the film be? Not too bad as I found out! It made me laugh and reminisce about how much of a Garfield fan I used to be when I was an 8 year old kid, way back in the 80\u0027s. I think I may still have a few of those old books...\n\nBut I digress. The film is engaging, funny and heartwarming. Bill Murray does a great job as the voice of Garfield (remember the guy who was the voice of Garfield in the 80\u0027s cartoon movies? I always liked that voice), and the human actors do a decent job too. But, it must be hard to play second fiddle to a big fat CGI cat!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
