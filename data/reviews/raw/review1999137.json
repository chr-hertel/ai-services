There are certainly many stars in this one. Jack Black, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, and Angelina Jolie just to name a few. But that doesn\u0027t always been a good movie. It has to have a good plot and this one actually does.\n\nLooking for the \"Dragon Warrior\" (yes, very clich√©), a furry animal warrior is sought. And Jack Black\u0027s overweight panda is found. With no kung fu experience, he is looked down upon by others. But yet a miracle takes place.\n\nThis actually is somewhat of a fun movie. I know many CGI films that just bust, but this not only had star power but a good plot as well.\n\nSo overall, its good. \"B\"", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
