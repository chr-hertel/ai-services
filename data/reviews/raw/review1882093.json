When he sees some Marines enter the bar with no money he buys them a couple of rounds of drinks. He is motivated to do so, he tells them, because he only lasted a month in the Marines before being discharged due to hayfever; although he cannot go home because he has told his mother that he is overseas and fighting in the war. The marines decide to help him out by returning home with him, pretending that Woodrow has returned home due to injury, thus protecting his mother\u0027s feelings. However their plan runs away from them when the whole town is out to greet them and lies are piled on top of lies.\n\nIt was the five stars allotted it in the Radio Times that drew my eye to this film and the general consensus of opinion among viewers seems to back up that this is a brilliant classic. I would love to agree and maintain the status quo because it would mean fewer abusive private messages about me \"sucking\", however for my money this film was not brilliant, although it was certainly good. The plot sees Woodrow\u0027s lie spiralling out of control as various groups in the town act in ways he did not predict, whether it be him becoming the pride of the town or the politicians who see capital in his achievements and so on. Ultimately the film takes us to a heart-warming conclusion of values and community in the Capra sense of things. In doing this it provides a roundly amusing story that leads to a happy ending and at this level I enjoyed it and found it flowed very easily.\n\nThe problem I had with it was how it is held up as a great piece of satire and I really don\u0027t think it is. This is not a failing in my perception because the film does have this edge where it holds up for ridicule the attitudes of the different groups to a war hero. This aspect is so-so I\u0027m afraid because it is not set up to be sharp, judgemental or anything other than gentle digging. Maybe this was all the subject could stand up to in the way of criticism at the time but looking back it is as fierce as a kitten toying with wool.\n\nThe delivery now appears to tend more towards the comic content, which is enough to carry the film if not enough to justify the \"classic\" label. Sturges has a good feel for the comedy in the characters and dialogue and he does really well in bringing this out. The cast had me waiting for a second because they seemed quite basic in their turns, quickly though I had been won over by the tight focus of their performances on the comedy within their characters and they did well for what was required. Bracken in particular plays Woodrow right for the comedy and it is not really his fault that he doesn\u0027t have that much chemistry with Raines. She is likewise OK apart from this failing. Walburn, Demarest, Conlin and others all play their parts well within the story and certainly there are no clunkers in there.\n\nI would like to praise Hail the Conquering Hero as many others have done if for no other reason than avoiding those that think swearing is the same as discussion but I cannot. For what it does well it is an amusing and quite jolly little film with a morally upbeat ending but the satire is soft to the point of being toothless. Enjoyable but not as good as its reputation would suggest." }
