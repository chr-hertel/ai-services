This movie is a textbook example of the \u0027Hero Story\u0027 as defined by Plato.\n\nFirst, show that your character is a hero. In the first ten minutes, Danny (Jet Li) amazes the audience as he uses every part of his body to inflict pain and injury to every part of the bodies around him. He goes from one scene to another, moping along in a daze. Then, his collar is removed and he explodes with a bloodthirsty fury. Of special note are the lack of wire-work scenes. Jet Li has been using a lot of wire-work in his recent movies, but this one is far more realistic.\n\nSecond, give your hero a crippling problem. In modern hero stories, the crippling problem is usually emotional. In Top Gun, the hero loses his partner. In Rocky, the hero has to choose between winning or his woman. In Star Wars, the hero has to deal with the fact that his father is the enemy. In Unleashed, the hero has a collar. It isn\u0027t as emotionally deep as other movies, but it works.\n\nThird, give the hero incentive to fight the odds. Danny has no reason to fight his master, Bart (Bob Hoskins), until he befriends Sam (Morgan Freeman) and his step-daughter (Kerry Condon). These two characters are too sweet. It is like finding a pool of honey in your three-bean chili. Honey is good, but it can easily be out of place. The primary fault comes in placement. This is the third part of the hero story, but it is placed well before the halfway point of the film. There is only one part of the hero story left and half a movie to do it in.\n\nFinally, the hero wins. Danny has to defeat Bart and save his new friends. Of course, he does it in a feast of violence.\n\nWalking away, I thought that I will eagerly pick up the DVD if and only if it contains loads of deleted action sequences. The plot is formulated and simple, even though the acting is outstanding for this genre. In fact, I really didn\u0027t mind the mistake of starting the third part so early because it gave Morgan Freeman a lot more screen time. My only problem is the premature ending. I longed to see Danny and his new friends in New York, looking across the water to the Statue of Liberty. Then, a thief tries to snatch the girl\u0027s purse and Danny grabs his arm. You know he could kill the thief in a matter of seconds, but he just tells him \"no.\" That would wrap up the story, letting you know that the hero has overcome his problem completely.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
