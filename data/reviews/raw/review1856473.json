It has an engaging plot, excellent casting and the characters are very well formed. This must have been an \"indie\" because we had not heard of it previously. There are notable performances by Chris Penn, Virginia Madsen, Jim Belushi and Tom Sizemore. The story takes place in a small Pennsylvania town and revolves around the wedding of two of the characters.It has a very genuine feel and a some good comedic moments. If you liked \"The Brothers McMullen\" or \"Diner\", you will like this movie. The plot has just enough twists and turns to keep the movie interesting without overdoing it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
