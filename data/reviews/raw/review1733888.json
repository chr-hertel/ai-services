It\u0027s an early work by Michael Powell. And the guy knew something about noir: How about \"Peeping Tom\"! Patric Knowles is perfect as the central character. He is a bit timid. He\u0027s genuinely attractive; so we understand why the ladies like him. He has a gentle quality that makes us care what happens to him.\n\nThis movie, like much film noir, involves a mercenary woman. There\u0027s a good woman, too.\n\nIt\u0027s directed smoothly and moves along quickly. I can\u0027t think of anything to fault it for. It\u0027s not a great movie. But it\u0027s an extremely skillful presentation.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
