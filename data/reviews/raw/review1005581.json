  "reviewBody": "I didn\u0027t even know about this movie until I chanced upon a trailer of it and then realised it hadn\u0027t even made it to the cinemas. I wondered why so I searched on IMDb, most comments are mixed but I reckoned I should give the movie a watch but couldn\u0027t get hold of the DVD until now. Only then did I know why it never made it to the box office nor even near any cinemas in certain countries.\n\nLet\u0027s face it - we go to the cinemas to forget our problems and not be reminded of them which is precisely the reason why movies like these don\u0027t make any money but others do. Most movies about injustice and persecution always have the good guys win in the end but this movie doesn\u0027t. In fact, we\u0027re introduced to the startling reality of the lives of volunteer workers and what they have to go through with all their good intentions in place. We are also introduced and/or reminded of the ugly side of humanity as to why certain countries will never be able to have peace because people are just too selfish fighting out their own agendas to spare any thought for another person.\n\nClive Owen was superb in this movie and whilst I would\u0027ve liked to see him paired up with Catherine-Zeta Jones (the original choice for the female lead), Angelina Jolie was pretty decent as well. It could\u0027ve been worst coz the behind-the-scenes commentary said their original male lead was Kevin Costner. No offence but I don\u0027t think he would\u0027ve pulled it off. He\u0027s too \u0027The Bodyguard\u0027 if you know what I mean. \n\nThe love story is just a sub-plot and was so subtly done and there are no mushy lovey-dovey sequences to make your eyes roll. It\u0027s just a simple story about two people bonded by their common passion but whilst one chooses to act it out whole-heartedly, the other keeps a silent but burning fire for it. Now, that\u0027s love! \n\nOne commentator here said that this movie doesn\u0027t do any justice for the refugees and the victims but I must say that no movie can. Even if you do visit these places to see for yourself what really goes on, you have a choice - you can leave whilst these people don\u0027t so unless you are in that exact same position, I think nobody should ever try to comment about it because it\u0027s something I don\u0027t think none of us in developed countries can ever truly understand. Besides, this movie is about the volunteer workers and what they have to go through and the love story between the two leads as the backdrop to distract us from the painful realities depicted in the movie. I don\u0027t really agree with some inaccurate plots in certain movies but I don\u0027t know the 110% truth about this movie so I just accept it and then find out more about it if I want to. It\u0027s something you can\u0027t expect from movies anyway coz movies are not supposed to educate but just to entertain and maybe enlighten us a little. You want a 100% accurate show, then go watch National Geographic.\n\nAll in all, the filmmakers of Beyond Borders deserve some credit for trying to tell a story different from the rest of the junk playing in the cinemas nowadays. Some of you might have felt they didn\u0027t really succeed but I still think they gave it their best shot. Now, you have to give them at least that!"
