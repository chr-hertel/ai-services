Between the music and the sight gags, somewhere in here you are going to have some big laughs and/or smiles.. (If not - if you can\u0027t laugh at this - why are you watching cartoons?)\n\nOh, man, is this the 1950s or what? Dig the modern furniture in hear and the \"hip\" jazz and Dixieland numbers. This will really be nostalgic for anyone around 60 years of age and older, but people of any age should laugh at the dancing bear. He\u0027s a cool bear, having escaped from the circus, and he just wants to eat and dance to some fast music.\n\nHe gets plenty of both at Tom\u0027s house (there are no humans around) with the jukebox in the living room. I won\u0027t say more, except this is a fun cartoon, fun for the eyes and the ears.\n\nThis is presented in the widescreen CinemaScope and is part of Disc 2 of the Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection Volume Two DVD.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
