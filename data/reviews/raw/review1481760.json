The fight sequences and action are absolutely amazing! I grew up watching the good days of Jackie Chan and Samo Hung, so I\u0027ve seen good fight movies before. Trust me, Van Damme wasn\u0027t on my list of good fighting movies. Knowing beforehand that this is a fighting (martial arts) movie I would find it nearly impossible for anyone to be unsatisfied. The only negative comments probably came from unhappy girlfriends who lost the coin flip and had to see this film with the boyfriend instead of some dumb $hit like the countless teeny bopper films targeting dumb high school kids. Just my 2 cents.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
