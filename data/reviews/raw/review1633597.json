These kids are not the spoil brats you may see in them. these people are just ordinary kids just being themselves not always the rock family attitude. I just got through watching the episode when Gene \u0026 Shannon had surgery on their faces. When Gene came back Nick was glad to see him but Sophie looked sad and you can just tell from her face she was about to bawl her eyes which just goes to show you she\u0027s human too. At first you see this young child very strong like her mom but she does have feelings too and seeing her dad in bandages really showed it all" }
