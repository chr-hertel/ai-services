Even though it\u0027s the twenty-first century, the director wants us to know that a lot of workers across the world have not benefited from the advancement in technology. First, we\u0027re off to Ukraine to learn about the work of some coal miners. Their work conditions are just unbelievable. Then, the director brings us to Indonesia to show us the hard work done by the sulfur miners (I didn\u0027t know nothing about this line of work). We are then transported to Pakistan, where we are shown the work of ship-breakers. Again, I was unaware that ship \"cemetaries\" of this sort still existed today. The open slaughterhouse of a Nigerian city is next. Animal activists beware: don\u0027t watch! I was just fascinated by the chaos that seems to reign in that place. Finally, we are shown the working conditions in the steel industry of China. \n\nAll those segments are presented without real context. There\u0027s no narration. But it\u0027s easy to follow, to get the point. And the images say a thousand words. Beautiful cinematography and very good camera movement. Some times, the camera moves with the subject, Some times, subject and camera are not moving. It\u0027s like a photo shot. One thing is for sure, you always feel like you\u0027re in the middle of the action. Even though, you see the despair, you can also see hope in what most of these workers say. Watch it. It\u0027s a great eye-opener.\n\nSeen at the Toronto International Film Festival (at the Cumberland Cinemas), on September 17th, 2005.\n\n87/100 (***Â½)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
