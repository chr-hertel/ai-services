Tough question...I have spoken to others about how much I love this movie, and then they have viewed it and asked me, \"What the hell was so great about it?\" All I can say is this is the kind of movie I love...it just has an overall feeling and flow that I enjoy. Also, it was filmed in Pittsburgh, and the exteriors of that steel town REALLY give this film a great look. Sometimes, you just don\u0027t want to see yet another movie filmed in Los Angeles! I would also say that if I were to recommend this to anyone, it would be to an artist, preferably a writer. There are great moments of the self-imposed torment that some writers put themselves through on a daily basis.\n\nI really love this movie.\n\nMilo Janus", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
