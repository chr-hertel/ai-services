Considering \"Anne of the Thousand Days\" is one of my favorites, I should have known better to think this could be just as good. The characters were not believable, not meaning the abilities of the actors, but the dialogue for each character. It felt weak from the first five minutes. Parts of the movie made me feel like I was watching a Renaissance fair, not a period piece. A bit repetitive as well concerning the \"birth\" scenes. Don\u0027t waste your money on this one, instead rent \"Anne of the Thousand Days\" (not on DVD, only VH). \"Anne of the Thousand Days\" is a beautifully written movie with believable characters and phenomenal performances, unlike \"The Other Boleyn Girl\"." }
