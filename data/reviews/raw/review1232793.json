It\u0027s based on a novel by Ken Kesey. This movie stars Jack Nicholson as Randall Patrick McMurphy, a man pretending to be insane to avoid going to jail. It co-stars Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched and people like Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd as mental patients. This is the movie in which they got their starts. Also starring Brad Dourif as B-Billy B-Bibbit. A bit of a touchy subject sometimes dealt with controversy, it still a great find. It won Oscars in all the main categories, the first film to do so in over 30 years. With great acting and a great twist at the end, Cuckoos Nest was is and always will be a hit with everyone.
