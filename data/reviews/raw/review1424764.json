To observe the delightful manner in which he almost distorts the language, while playing a puppet is always a joy. The added charms of Silvia Fine\u0027s skill at twisting the words while allowing her husband to remain twisted in the puppet strings is fun. Only Danny possessed the tongue to deliver such new-fangled words. Watch out, did you recognize Gwen Verdon? She is there all right! Those legs can not be missed, although her beautiful voice is dubbed right out of the movie. The best line of this film has to be, \"Mnnnn\" with the impersonator unable to say either yes or no to the business mogul\u0027s demands, thus increasing the bid ever higher. Did Gene sleep with her husband or with the actor? To this day, I still don\u0027t know, and that was a sexy idea to develop. Three cheers for it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
