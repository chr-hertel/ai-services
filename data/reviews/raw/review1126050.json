Even though I haven\u0027t seen this show since it originally aired on TV (in Australia, where we\u0027re oblivious to the US Network changes), those early episodes with the original 4 sliders sliding to different \u0027what-if\u0027 scenarios was an addictive formula with a great potential from a sci-fi perspective. After the professor left (Rhys-Davies), boy did this show begin to STINK!\n\nThe change of show format was too unsettling. Since I have repressed memories of the show when it truly began to \u0027slide\u0027 (pardon the pun), I can only say the show declined greatly due to these factors -\n\nWhen the boring Kromags began playing a more prominent role in the series. The show also began to take itself too seriously. \n\nWhen Kari Wuhrer was a cast member. Big boobs \u003d so what?\n\nThe dullness of Charlie O\u0027Connell, fortunately he only lasted for a year until replaced by the soporific Robert Floyd - however, I can not even vaguely remember this character or what he looks like, which gives a good indication of how bad and unmemorable (and ultimately, in light of how good the show was, sad) the last season was.\n\nAnd lastly, the change in theme - from one of \u0027what-if\u0027 to a show about battling the boring Kromags with characters that are not interesting especially since they replaced superior characters. \n\nIt would be interesting to watch the whole series again, from the superior first half to the wretch of the second half. Even though I saw the last season, I can not simply recall any of the episodes (was it really that bad?), except that one one original cast member (Derricks) was left, accompanied by bland cast members.\n\nTo cap my review off, a great show reduced to rubbish :(" }
