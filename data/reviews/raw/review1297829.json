Very different than other espionage thrillers, not only because it contains deep reflections on our reality but also for being accompanied by reflections and mind stimulations. Acting\u0027s convincing, clarity in telling facts is total and plus it\u0027s more detailed than any other geopolitical flick I\u0027ve ever seen. It aims at showing the marriage of global business and politics, together with US interference in every dirty affair. From top to bottom a must-see movie..", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
