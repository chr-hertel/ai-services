It made me laugh, cry, jump out of my seat in amazement. Joss Whedon has crafted a masterpiece here which doesn\u0027t fail to check all the boxes - flawed, human, good guys, an almost angelically evil bad guy, breath taking sets and backgrounds and an attention to detail which shows this was a real labour of love. It\u0027s great to see a movie which really engages the viewers intelligence - sci fi doesn\u0027t have to be brylcreemed good guys firing lasers and monotonous bad guys. You can\u0027t help but love all the characters, even when they are doing wrong. They seem to integrate into a seamless whole even when their personalities seem to be pretty incompatible. Joss Whedon\u0027s skill as a storyteller shines through when you see how all the characters have new facets which are revealed as the film progresses, bringing a surprise in every scene. Even when something happens which is predictable you are made to feel as though you were meant to predict by understanding the characters involved. One of the best things about the film was the way all the characters were introduced for those who hadn\u0027t seen Firefly, in a way which wasn\u0027t annoying for those of us who have. A great movie, Mr Whedon you are a genius!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
