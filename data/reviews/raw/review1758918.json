Zanuck teamed his two leading adult stars in the forties, Tyrone Power and Betty Grable co-star in A Yank in the RAF. I think the title explains all in terms of the location.\n\nPower plays one of his patented hero/heel types, a lot like Dion O\u0027Leary in In Old Chicago. If you\u0027ll remember Alice Faye was being courted by the two O\u0027Leary brothers, sober and industrious Don Ameche and devil may care Tyrone Power. \n\nNow it\u0027s Betty as an entertainer over in the United Kingdom to entertain and otherwise help out in the war effort. She meets Ty who is also over there as an American volunteer in the RAF. Ty\u0027s someone who really isn\u0027t that crazy about military and other kinds of discipline, but he\u0027s one charming rogue and Betty can\u0027t get her fill of him.\n\nTaking the Ameche part is very British and very stiff upper lip John Sutton. He\u0027s totally flipping out over Grable and who could blame him. Still it\u0027s Tyrone who powers the Grable engine.\n\nJohn Sutton would co-star again with Ty Power after World War II in a vastly different part in Captain from Castile. He plays the cowardly and malevolent Diego DeSylva and that particular part from him might have been his career role. In my book it\u0027s one of the most evil villains the screen has ever had.\n\nReginald Gardiner and a whole flock of other British actors from Hollywood\u0027s British colony lend support. The RAF flying sequences were shot over in the war theater and were nominated for Best Special Effects.\n\nBetty sings some forgettable tunes as an entertainer by Leo Robin and Ralph Rainger. But heard throughout the film is the standard These Foolish Things. That song, as popular in Great Britain where it originated as in the United States, is one of the best ballads ever written. Why Zanuck didn\u0027t have Betty sing it is a mystery. \n\nIt\u0027s by no means clear who Betty winds up with in the end. I could make a case for either Power or Sutton. You\u0027ll have to see the film and make your own mind up. One thing for sure is that Ty is far from reforming. You\u0027ll have to see the film to see what I\u0027m talking about there.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
