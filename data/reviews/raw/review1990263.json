I LOVED IT! It makes you laugh, cry and makes almost all of your other emotions come out within the movie. Here are my ratings.\n\nPerformance/Acting: Shahrukh Khan : 10/10; Anushka Sharma : 10/10; Vinay Pathak : 10/10; Direction : 9.5/10; Production : 10/10; Everything else : 9.5/10 (The script took the marks down a little) OVERALL : 9.8/10\n\nSynoposis: This movie is about a simple man named Surinder Sahni or Suri, who is played by Shahrukh Khan. At the start, him and his \"LOVE\" Taani (Anushka Sharma) get married. Actually, Taani, at first, is scheduled to marry someone else, who is not shown at all in the movie. Taani\u0027s \"future\" husband dies in an accident on the way and Taani\u0027s father gets a heart attack after that. He asks Taani to marry Suri. They both agree. Taani says to Suri that she\u0027ll be his wife, but will never \"love\" him. :( She then finds a poster about a dance competition and she wants to participate. Although Suri is a simple guy, he agrees.\n\nSuri goes to Bobby Khosla (Vinay Pathak) and Bobby does a complete makeover of Suri and turns him into a cool, bad boy Raj. Raj and Taani first meet at the Dacing Jodi Competition (Raj is Taani\u0027s partner). At first Taani thinks that Raj is an awful guy, but she later changes her mind. Suri now wants to know if she loves Suri or Raj. He keeps on disguising as Raj.\n\nJust about at the end, Taani asks Raj to run away with her. At her last day (competition day), Suri and Taani go to the Golden Temple. She asks god for one thing. That is to see god in a person and turns out that it\u0027s Suri. She decides not to run away with Raj. Raj doesn\u0027t show up at the competition, but Suri does. Suri and Taani get 2 free tickets to Japan and spend their honey-moon there. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY! :) Bye", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
