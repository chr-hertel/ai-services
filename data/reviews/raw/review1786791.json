Its greatest achievement, in my mind, is that it doesn\u0027t rely on the usual rogue\u0027s gallery of talking heads that consume three-quarters of most documentaries. \n\nDepending on your mood, \u0027Who the Hell, etc.\u0027 can be engaging and even dazzling. Some of the cinematography, particularly around Havana\u0027s iconic Malecon seawall, is spectacular. When I discovered that Mexican director Carlos Marcovich is a music video specialist, why was I not surprised? The film is loaded with signature cinematography that appeals to the MTV mobs: panorama shots, razzle-dazzle hand-held work, fast cuts and clips, alternating black\u0026white/colour, faces that suddenly appear and speak, five different locations (we\u0027re not sure at one point if we\u0027re in Mexico City or Havana), and a \u0027story line\u0027 that is often confusing.\n\nJuliette is, in 1995, a 16-year-old Havana prostitute who is a study in contrasts. Her mother died violently when she was two years old, and her father left for the U.S. a year earlier. She is a child of the streets who can be be endearingly playful yet often irritating; she mixes delightful youthfulness with a maturity beyond her years. Toward the end of the film, she finally goes to Mexico City to visit her father Victor, whom she has not seen since she was a year old. Needless to say, it\u0027s an awkward reunion.\n\nThis can be interesting film, particularly when the often-impish Juliette tries to explain her philosophy of being. In the end, we can answer the question \u0027Who is Juliette?\u0027 by saying, \u0027We\u0027re not really sure because she doesn\u0027t know who she is herself, but she\u0027s trying\u0027.\n\nA huge let-down on the DVD extras is a 2006 update on Juliette, replete with footage of an ailing Fidel Castro. But it\u0027s entirely in Spanish, with no subtitles, and my rudimentary knowledge of the language left me befuddled. It was a huge -- and insulting -- mistake by the distributors, who had no trouble providing full subtitles for the film itself. This often happens with extras on DVDs -- crucial subtitles are missing. It\u0027s inexcusable.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
