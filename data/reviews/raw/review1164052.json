Sophie Scholl was a member of the White Rose, who distributed pamphlets against Hitler at the Munich university in 1943. That was of course suicide. Gestapo got them.\n\nThis is not only a recapitulation. Far from it. There is also a small but strong mini drama between Scholl and the Gestapo interrogator and despite the situation and what in the end can\u0027t be avoided, it\u0027s not clear who really wins that battle.\n\nVery good acting by Julia Jentsch and Gerald Alexander Held here. A real nightmare and a perverse situation, but still taken out of life. This is not only drama. It is also possible.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
