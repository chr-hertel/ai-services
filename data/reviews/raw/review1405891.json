I think I fell in love with Frank Langella because of it - OK, OK, so I was much younger and more impressionable at the time but, well, he was beguiling. As suggested in one or two other commentaries on this, I felt it was as effective a version, if not even a tad better than the 1940 one - perhaps because of both the eponymous hero\u0027s sexual magnetism and the charming, intelligent and spirited Anne Archer\u0027s Teresa. From what I remember, the film was to a large extent faithful to Tyrone Power\u0027s vehicle, and added a J-ne-sais-quoi to it.\n\nDashing as Power undoubtedly was, to my taste Langella\u0027s rich chocolatey voice, commanding height and seductive gaze made this viewer long to be the object of his affections. I admit it, I\u0027m shamefacedly still a bit in love with the character!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
