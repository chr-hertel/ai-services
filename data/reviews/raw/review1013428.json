The gorgeous women of the cast all wear short skirts and we get plenty of opportunities to see up them. The rape scenes are as graphic as possible within the rating category. The opening sequence, in which a pretty young maiden is kidnapped, raped and dismembered, is a real keeper. Also worth noting is the music and sound design.\n\nThere is a gleeful amorality about Lai\u0027s films, a nod (intentionally or unintentionally?) to Japanese \"violent pink\" cinema of the 70\u0027s and 80\u0027s.\n\nThe modus operandi of rapist Roy Chen Chih-Lai does not really wash, but that is not the point of this film. The point is gleeful sensationalism of gutter-level subject matter.\n\nThere is a strong erotic undercurrent and leading lady Jade Leung is pretty damn cute and pretty damn feisty as a police detective on the rapist\u0027s blood-spattered trail. Miho Nomoto, a Japanese actress who plays Jade\u0027s sister, turns in a terrific masturbation scene that pushes the boundaries of the rating.\n\nAlthough it doesn\u0027t maintain the style and pace its opening stanza establishes, it is still righteous, unapologetic sleaze.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
