It has a plot that is interesting to follow, and the action is intense and believable. Mel Gibson displays his romantic and heroic side in a way that really touches me. He is truly talented and is very remarkable in this film. The entire supporting cast really brings a lot of belief into the movie as well. One aspect of the movie that held my interest is how we are able to see William\u0027s character as an innocent child and as a grown man whose fate becomes that of a hero. This is a widely viewed movie, but if you haven\u0027t seen it yet, I encourage you to check it out and see if it appeals to your taste. It\u0027s serious, emotional, and powerful!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
