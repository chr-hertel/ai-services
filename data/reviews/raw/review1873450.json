The story was unique and entertaining, while remaining unpredictable. The filming was very well done. I enjoyed traveling along with the characters and watching the scenery. \n\nThe female lead plays a mistreated woman who\u0027s ready to take over the power in this twisted relationship. I think there is a lot of truth to her situation and most will find it very relatable. Thank you to the makers of this film, I really enjoyed watching it.\n\n\"chuol\"", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
