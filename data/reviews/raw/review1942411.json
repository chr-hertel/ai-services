I enjoyed watching this movie 2 times in the cinema now. 1st time I-max in Amsterdam 2nd in the local little theater. My girlfriend is a big fan of this movie (yeah women definitely enjoy watching this movie also) But, this movie went #1 within a week on IMDb. That means it surpassed all the movies registered on world\u0027s largest Internet Movie Database. I\u0027m sorry but am I the only one who thinks that the movie owes this success to Heath Ledger\u0027s death? Not that he didn\u0027t act marvelous in this movie, he did. But I could name lots of movies which are better, or more entertaining, or more complex. I didn\u0027t even had to hold my breath in this movie.\n\nNormally I\u0027d give this movie 10 stars but since everybody blindly does that I must give it 1 star.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
