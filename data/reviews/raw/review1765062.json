This was an excellent film in every aspect. The acting, cinematography, editing, musical score, story and locations were all top-notch. I enjoyed this film more than I did Saving Private Ryan(also gave a 10 star rating).\n\nI was intrigued by how much Colonel Hal Moore(played by Gibson) really cared about his soldiers. You can really see the pain he endured when his \"BOYS\", as he called them, were getting killed off during the battle in the \"Valley of Death.\" \n\nThe final attack of the film to finish off the Vietnamese was brilliant. Incredible movie with an incredible production team behind it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
