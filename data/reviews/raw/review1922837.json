The \"scientific backgrounds\", however naive to the scientists\u0027 minds, gave a lively support for the Batman\u0027s sophistication.\n\nThe Nolans were simply gifted, every character got a new story to tell: Joker, Two-Face both had new meanings. They were no longer simple, hilarious, funny or stupid characters. And indeed I think Heath Ledger did his role better than Jack Nicholson.\n\nIt was enjoyable to see this movie, it is definitely the very definitive guide to the future Batman movies.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
