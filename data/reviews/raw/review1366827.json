The accounts given here on the thread are mostly lauding it, but I will add a few I recall.\n\n1) A television history program that is pompously mis - announced as \"FROM HYPOCRITES TO EINSTEIN.\" Then a small, slightly timid voice - like the owner does not want to embarrass the announcer - stating, \"That\u0027s \"Hippocrates\".\" The announcer, unfortunately sounding embarrassed, quickly says, \"As I said, \"FROM HIPPOCRATES TO EINSTEIN\". What followed was supposedly the story of various great events of the history of western man to be shown on this series, ending with the voice announcing, \"and finally, and not least, that greatest moment in modern exploration: STANLEY AND LIVINGSTON.\" We see two men wearing pith helmets who rise out of neighboring garbage cans and shake hands!! \n\n2)The adventures of an eccentric, thin elderly man with a ridiculous long chin whisker and eyeglasses. He is the manufacturer of that remarkable automobile, \"the Midget - Widgett\" motor car (which looks all of four feet in length).\n\n3) The adventures (narrated by the anti-hero) of a high ranking Nazi officer (Eric Von Stroheim) hiding after the war - successfully for a time - as a ventriloquist, until betrayed by his dummy.\n\n4) The story of the 20th Century\u0027s greatest predictor of the future - whose record is tarnished to all (but the announcer, apparently) by the fact that he never gets anything correct. I recall that at one point he is sent films of the German army in the field in 1914-15 and writes a letter to Kaiser Wilhelm II, stating that after viewing the film he is certain that victory is assuredly for Germany. He then sends the letter and the film home to Germany...on the Lusitania.\n\n5) The story of the hitherto unknown fifth and youngest Kennedy brother, who is upset that his four older siblings (including the dead Joe Jr., apparently) have outstripped him in prestige and public attention. So he takes his society friends with him from Hyannisport to the south seas, and hunts for a famous pirate treasure. And they find it too - unfortunately they are robbed of it at gunpoint by the villain: the sixth and youngest Rockefeller brother, upset that his five older siblings have outstripped him in prestige and public attention.\n\nIt was consistently amusing, and had the added plus of Hans Conreid as it\u0027s host. I am glad that it is now out on DVD (if the other comments on this thread are correct). Well worth watching indeed.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
