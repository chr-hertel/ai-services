Cheesy? Sure. Silly? Of course. But you have to suspend a certain amount of disbelief: this is live-action anime...with a premise, characters, dialog, outfits and weaponry that share more in common with girl manga and anime than with typical teen movie fare. The whole art direction of the thing is comic-bookish in the best way. Just as Quentin Tarantino paid homage to anime in his way with Kill Bill (well, and to Hong Kong action movies and spaghetti westerns, etc.), so, too, Angela Robinson has paid homage to the genre in her way with D.E.B.S. This film has the feel of serial anime. It makes me want to see the next episode in the series. Loved the character of Lucy Diamond. What if there was a whole movie(or anime or comic book) just around her....?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
