The narrative never lacks, with the whole concept of danger keeping you on the edge of your seat all the way through. Not necessarily scary, but it will definitely play on your mind. The ending with the new stadium felt like a marketing promotion, but was still good to watch. The plot has action, suspense and drama, to make an ultimate thriller, with plenty of gory blood encoded for dramatic effect, which is helped along by stunning direction.\n\nDanny Boyle\u0027s direction in 28 days was superb, unusual and different, particularly the opening sequences as the central character is alone in England, with the character a little man in a huge city.\n\nFresnadillo\u0027s direction in this sequel is equally impressive, using similar shots to create the lonely and deserted effect. In contrast Fresnadillo\u0027s direction is faster and less focused, especially when the infected are involved, conforming brilliantly to the horror thriller genres. These films wouldn\u0027t have had the same impact if this style of direction hadn\u0027t been encoded, and is a film where you can really appreciate the atmospheric view of the situation.\n\nHaving Robert Carlyle (Trainspotting) star gave the film the extra credit it needed, with a fine performance as Don. He did exceptionally well, and gave a different and intriguing portrayal as a struggling family man. Carlyle is helped along by stunning performances by all cast, but in particular Muggleton and Poots, who play Don\u0027s kids, two of the best young performances you will ever see in a British film, only behind Tom Turgoose in This is England.\n\n28 weeks later is a fine sequel, fast and flowing, and though not necessarily scary, is a thoroughly entertaining British film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
