What could have become merely a talkative short portraying a guy whining about his love life instead becomes a rousing film that combines several genres into a truly satisfying sixteen minutes of viewing. The savvier of the two men has an unexpected and challenging quandary. The smart lad is into two women named Megan, who are polar opposites: one has a sensitive healing personality, whereas the other has an ambitious kinky nature. What should a poor guy do, since neither fulfills his needs? The surprising results are purely satisfying, and make this short that is stocked with clever dialogue and strong visuals feel less like a little film and more like a teaser for the not-yet released feature destined for cult status.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
