This movie is perverse, it provokes a feeling of sick to your stomach and not in a good way- I\u0027m not even conservative when it comes to these things. It also has no plot except to make you want to vomit. It is one long cheap gag and not worth even putting on for five minutes. If you like movies with substance or at least some kind of plot or real scare do not watch this if you are however, looking for something to scream at this is perfect for you.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
