The very fact that it has been picked up for broadcast by television stations around the world and is on this very website is a credit to everyone who had a hand in making it. \n\nYes there are flaws in the film, yes the actors are green, but don\u0027t you think there is something inspiring in seeing something that was made out of pure passion and love as opposed to the majority of big budget films constantly being spued out from Hollywood?\n\nAnd one last thing, the director is a very accomplished theatre and FILM professional, what have you done to qualify your expert opinion?" }
