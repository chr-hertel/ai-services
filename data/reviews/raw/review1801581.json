As a serial killer movie, it is - in my opinion - number one, with Se7en a hair behind it. I don\u0027t have to go on about it\u0027s fine points, and if there is one flaw, it\u0027s constant breaking of the fourth wall, something I\u0027m not a fan of. Still, this isn\u0027t enough of a detraction to mar the film in the slightest. It\u0027s a masterpiece. Nuff said.\n\nHannibal was really well done if vastly different to the book, even if Jodie Foster didn\u0027t return to reprise the role of Clarice Starling. Gary Oldman was creepy as f@#k as Mason Verger, and Ray Liotta was amazingly slimy as Paul Krendler.\n\nRed Dragon was, I thought, a very solid film considering it\u0027s director is not known for making emotionally intense films. It followed the book faithfully, and had an amazing - some would say TOO amazing - cast. Hell, even Manhunter, Michael Mann\u0027s take on the same book was a great flick. Which leads us to Hannibal Rising.\n\nSigh.\n\nWhere to begin? I must admit that this review may be a little biased as I couldn\u0027t stomach more than the first twenty minutes of the film. I turned it off, and if I hadn\u0027t hired it, I would have burnt the disc. It was abysmal. It was the Batman and Robin of the Hannibal series. It took a great franchise and butchered it beyond the point of recognition, to a point that made Mason Verger look like a pretty boy. And I\u0027m being polite here.\n\nFirst of all, Gaspard Ulliel as Hannibal. WTF? I\u0027m not saying he\u0027s a bad actor, not at all, but could they not have cast someone who wouldn\u0027t have had the problem of performing in a movie not written in their native tongue? Not that I think non-English speakers shouldn\u0027t appear in English spoken films, far from it, it\u0027s just Hannibal has been well established as having an English - or if you want to be picky with Anthony Hopkins\u0027 heritage - Welsh accent. Ulliel has a very strong French accent. Now call me petty if you will, but wouldn\u0027t it bug the hell out of you if when Vader spoke his first words in Revenge Of The Sith, he was voiced by Hayden Christensen? \n\nNext, we have certain elements of the story to contend with. I haven\u0027t read the book for Hannibal Rising, but if it\u0027s anything like the movie, then I\u0027m very disappointed in Thomas Harris. Young Hannibal as some sort of half-hearted Samurai apprentice? Come on, that has to be the lamest idea I\u0027ve ever heard, up there with at least half of the plot of X-Men 3. And trying to humanize him by showing his first kill as being motivated by some sort of loyalist chivalry towards his adopted aunt...Jesus wept!! \n\nAvoid like the plague, particularly if you\u0027re a fan of the first four films. Stinks worse than Jame Gumb\u0027s woman suit.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
