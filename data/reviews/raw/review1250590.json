This director is a god-damn genius. The script is so funny and the love story so on the money. Everyone talks about Kingsley, and he\u0027s great of course (he got the Oscar nod but lost to Broadbent) but the truth of the matter is the whole ensemble is terrific. Dee Dee, and H and Teddy, these characters are all time greats, And Winstone...forget about it, he makes Kingsley powerful. Winstone\u0027s got him by a hundred pounds but you believe he\u0027s afraid of Ghandi..I love him. I\u0027d walk a mile on my hands and knees through broken glass just to have him pee on my toothbrush. If you haven\u0027t seen Birth yet, check it out. This guy Glazer scares me he\u0027s so talented check out the Radiohead videos while you\u0027re at it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
