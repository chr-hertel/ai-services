His belief was based on mysterious happenings at the Paris Opera House (including the kidnapping of singer Christine Daaé, the disappearance of the Vicomte de Chagny, and the murder of his brother, Count Phillippe), and a letter Christine had written before her disappearance. Some believe the the opera ghost was responsible for all three crimes. Some believe that the Vicomte \u0026 his brother were vying for Christine and the Vicomte murdered his brother. Some believe that after their disappearance Christine and her Vicomte lived out their lives together in some secret unknown place. All this intrigue has very little to do with Leroux\u0027s novel nor with the theatrical productions based on it.\n\nA subterranean lake does in fact exist in the lower levels of the Paris Opera House. It was discovered during construction. It was one of the factors that delayed completion of the opera house for almost fifteen years. It was decided that the best thing to do was to leave the lake there and work with it.\n\nI had the good fortune to visit the Paris Opera House many years ago, and in the movie theater yesterday I felt like I was there. I\u0027m quite sure that it was not shot on location, so I\u0027m impressed.\n\nAs far as the casting of the lead roles, I defer to the taste of Andrew Lloyd Webber himself. At first I was disappointed in the Phantom\u0027s voice, but as he becomes more angry and violent, his voice matches the drama. I find it interesting that Webber would cast the former lead singer in a rock band for his Phantom - but Webber\u0027s phantom is in essence a rock star - sexy, intriguing, edgy, and dangerous. He\u0027s the archetypal man your mother warned you about.\n\nThe first time we hear Christine sing, her voice is soft and hesitant, as one would expect the first time a child is thrown unexpectedly into the limelight. In her first song we hear her voice grow to what I can only describe as amazing for an eighteen-year-old actress. She was perfectly cast - a young, innocent girl, living a sheltered existence, knowing very little of the real world (the opera house is her world). She\u0027s frightened of and yet helplessly pulled in by the overpowering predatory personality of the Phantom, and finding true love at the same time with Raoul.\n\nI loved Raoul from the moment I saw him on screen.\n\nA few things bothered me. Raoul had to be at least twenty years younger than Mme. Rémy, and yet in the black \u0026 white scenes they appeared to be about the same age.\n\nThe audio often didn\u0027t sync with the video. The most glaring example of that was at the beginning of \"Masquerade.\" For an entire line the singing was exactly one beat off from the lips. They had to have done it on purpose - perhaps they thought the dancing fit the music better one beat off, so they decided to just edit it that way and hope nobody noticed. I guess they didn\u0027t want to set up the scenery, costumes, etc. and re-shoot just to fix 5 seconds.\n\nThe other instances weren\u0027t so glaring, but they were still disconcerting, and makes me think that for such an elaborate production they were in an awful hurry to get it out of production and in front of the public. I really wish they had taken the time to get it right.\n\nOther than the technical problems that at times were disconcerting, I was supremely entertained, as I was when I saw the play. So much has been made of \"The Phantom of the Opera,\" but when it comes down to it, it\u0027s just great fun.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
