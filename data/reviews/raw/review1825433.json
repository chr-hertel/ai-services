The story was great, and there\u0027s only one murder!(unusual for Midsomer Murders). Consequently, there was no need for those preposterous explanations as to why a lovely old lady had to kill 3 or 4 times in order to protect her son or some such nonsense. Lately, I\u0027ve been watching MM for the love of beautiful images only. But this episode is believable and dramatic - the way Midsomer Murders used to be.\n\nAlso, I enjoyed the great chemistry (and relationship of trust) between John Nettles and Siobhan Redmond(Dr. Plunkett), and the intimation of something that \"might have been\". Great insight into Barnaby\u0027s soul.A devoted husband, a doting father...but not only.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
