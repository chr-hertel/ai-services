I don\u0027t know much about Polish cinema but this is probably one of the best Polish movies. It\u0027s very entertaining crime comedy. The budged of this film is pretty low but the plot, acting and directing compensate it. There isn\u0027t much jokes but the ending was really funny. It\u0027s also good as a crime movie. I liked the dialogs between criminals and also the way they planed bank robbery. If you get a chance to see this movie, don\u0027t waste it because it\u0027s really interesting (althau it may appear a little boring in the beginning). I also liked the style of these gangsters - the way they talked and worked reminded me of some Hollywood crime movies.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
