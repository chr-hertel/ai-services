The script is good, the performances are good. The storyline needs to be told. However, the extreme complexity - mentioned in just about every comment - is really unnecessary. There are five or six separate convergent threads which demand some very careful attention to detail from the audience. I dare say these threads help to solidify the book (which I haven\u0027t read). But in the movie, there\u0027s too much. At least one, maybe two of the threads could have been cut entirely without missing the point of the movie. My vote would be to cut out Matt Damon\u0027s family issues from the movie - ditto for Jeffrey Wright\u0027s character. However, if you are prepared for very complex, intellectually stimulating political thriller, this is for you.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
