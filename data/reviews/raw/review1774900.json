I loved the clever philosophy all the way through. If there was a big-budget remake - and there deserves to be one - the baddie would be a gimme for Jack Nicholson. The atmosphere was good, the special effects were great and very cleverly used to create shocks. Every plot twist was well thought out and all the way through you\u0027re wondering what \u0027The Club\u0027 actually is.\n\nAnd then, slowly, you realise......!! Find the film and realise for yourself - I\u0027m not going to spoil it for you. Forget the first comment about it, that guy didn\u0027t \u0027get\u0027 it. I\u0027ve seen it about 4 times, it\u0027s worth it." }
