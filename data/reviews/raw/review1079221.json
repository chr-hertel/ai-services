Although being that Priscilla was a big part of Elvis live after his momma died you would\u0027ve thought they would\u0027ve gotten somebody prettier to play her. Rose McGowan was good but not great in the role of Ann-Margaret, and Robert Patrick as Vernon was definitely a mistake in casting. Anyone else expecting to see him morph into a Terminator? I would give Cameron Manhiem kudos for a wonderful portrayal of Gladys Presley \u0026 Randy Quaid made the Colonel so incredibly controlling that we hate him even more today after watching this movie. I hope this is going to be available on DVD, because its one my list as a keeper!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
