Although the movie starts in media res, the plot is linear. Zekeria Ebrahimi plays Amir, the privileged son of a powerful father (Homayoun Ershadi). His friend and servant, Hassan, played by Ahmad Khan Mahmidzada, is Amir\u0027s constant companion and de facto bodyguard. (Amir is creative and intelligent, but not brave.)\n\nFor complex reasons, Hassan and his father leave the household and return to their native village. Amir and his father escape the Russians and move to the United States.\n\nThe film follows the historical turmoil of Afghanistan--invasion by the Russians, and then conquest by the dreaded Taliban. Parallel to these historical problems are the personal problems between the two boys, and the complex relationship between Amir and his father, both in Afghanistan and the United States. Khalid Abdalla plays Amir as an adult, and the lovely Atossa Leoni portrays his wife, Soraya. They are both excellent, as are all the actors. I was particularly impressed by the work of Shaun Toub as the family friend, Rahim Kahn.\n\nEven at two hours, the movie couldn\u0027t encompass the entire plot of the novel. However, the material left out wasn\u0027t crucial to plot or character development. A few seconds of gunfire have been added, but that\u0027s understandable also. \n\nAlthough this excellent film will stand on its own, I think it would be more enjoyable after you\u0027ve read the book. We saw it on a large screen, which is always preferable, especially for a movie that has repeated shots of harsh mountain landscape. However, it should work well enough on DVD. It\u0027s really a great movie, and definitely worth seeking out in whatever format you can find it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
