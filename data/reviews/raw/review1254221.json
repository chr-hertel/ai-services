She looks great in this movie. She sure has won me over. Who want\u0027s coffee and a piece of bunt cake? Erin\u0027s hand goes up right now and Ed says they have to go. Erin quickly straightens him out and he says \"I love bunt cake\". This movie is better the second time you watch it because it does\u0027nt drag and is fun from start to finish. Didn\u0027t care too much for George. Kind of hard to believe a biker would be such a great family man and would want to be a baby sitter. Don\u0027t think he would have volunteered if the lady would have not been a beauty queen. It\u0027s always fun to watch an intelligent women lead a man around by the the nose. Seen it many times and enjoy it every time. Fun to see David beat Goliath. It was also fun at the end to see Ed finally shut Erin\u0027s mouth. It was really neat to see the real Erin Brockovich and Ed Masry in the diner scene. As for Julia Roberts being a great actress, in the scene where Pete Jensen is throwing rocks at P G\u0026E in the middle of the night we then focus on Erin in the house with Donna. Donna sobbing asks Erin to go get them. Erin is looking at Donna and couldn\u0027t say a word lest she would start weeping. The look on Erin\u0027s face and the nod she gives Donna speaks volumes without saying a word. As Tony The TIger would say \"greeeeeeeeeat\"! She is the greatest right behind Sandra Bullock.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
