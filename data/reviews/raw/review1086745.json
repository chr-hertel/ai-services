Nobody becomes a master overnight; oh no, the movie jumps ahead 12 years to show that it damn well takes time to master a decent kung fu style!\n\nThe fight scenes are nothing less than stupendous. This is old school wireless fighting at its best, helmed by Hong Kong\u0027s premiere martial arts choreographer, not to mention the stellar fighting skills of the great Ka-Yan Leung.\n\nThe story is also good, although the end, with the entire national honor of China at stake, perhaps stretches credibility a bit. But the yarn is structured very well, so the audience is engaging their emotions in the story, right up to the end.\n\nIf you\u0027re looking for a really good, classic kung fu movie with lots of action and lots of intensity, you can\u0027t do much better than this.\n\nMy rating: 9 out of 10.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
