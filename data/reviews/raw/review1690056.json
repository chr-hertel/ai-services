Colette was already a star in Australia, though unheard of elsewhere, but both of these amazing actresses demonstrate in this film the qualities that have shown them to be among the most accomplished and versatile actresses in film and television today.\n\nOne more thing, I caught Toni Colette doing a star turn in the Broadway musical \"The Wild Party.\" This woman is a great musical performer. I would be willing to bet her band is terrific.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
