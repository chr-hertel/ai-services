Matt Damon did good, Leonardo Dicaprio did great, Jack Nicholson did awesome, but being that he was barely even there, Mark Wahlberg did the BEST! This drama film almost turned into comedy every time he spoke.\n\nThe film held an excellent story line leaving you waiting for more till the very, very end and yet leaves you wanting more. It\u0027s a who did, when, what? kind of movie that leaves the audience at the edge of their seats to puzzle piece ever thing together.\n\nI\u0027d definitely keep this movie in my collection to watch again, and again. Leo is hot, so why wouldn\u0027t I? Can\u0027t get any better action this this. I\u0027d put 3 thumbs up if I had an extra, but I guess till then, I\u0027ll give two thumbs up to the sky!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
