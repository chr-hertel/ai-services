Although what was then considered pornographic would pass as PG-rated today, there are those in the senate who even today feel the same as the senators depicted in the film. Mol projects an alluring mix of sensuality and wholesomeness as the confused girl from Tennessee who rebels against her strict upbringing by boldly going where few women during that period had gone before. By filming in black and white, Harron conveys the feeling of a documentary, although it shifts to color at times in a somewhat random fashion.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
