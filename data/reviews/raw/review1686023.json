The only aspect of this episode worth bragging about is the Soprano-esquire scenes between Stewie and Brian, and the revenge Brian gets at the end (only because I know a few people that I\u0027d like to do that to). It was stupid singing, stupid dancing, and the ever-homo-sounding voice of Tom Brady. If you were going to do an episode involving the Patriots, make fun of them, because there\u0027s nothing in the department of humor that the Patriots can contribute (if you don\u0027t believe me, watch SNL when Tom Brady hosted it; Peyton Manning had more humor in the introduction than Tom\u0027s entire show).
