Hence I went for a sneak preview at the theatres where then Saw II caught my eyes till the end . It is one the best thrillers I have seen in years . The movie ended with an awesome climax which literally attracts all cinema lovers to watch this movie again and again . This is a film that keeps us glued to our seat till the end of the film . The story has been written very well and Leigh Whannell Receives a salute from me to him for his awesome job . I really await the third sequel which i believe would be more heart-pounding . And \" Oh yes , there was a lot of blood \" . A salute to the whole Saw Team .", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
