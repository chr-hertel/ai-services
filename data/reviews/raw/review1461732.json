The character who played wolverine,Eric Von Sydow , was right on the money ,he\u0027s the one that should of been in all the x-men movies. Yea, there was a little prob with some of the voice overs not matching the mouth movements ,but that all quickly went away in the movie. You have to understand ,that this is not a big budget release ,so imagine if they had a a big budget to work with,The results would be incredible. The story line went a little too fast for me. Other than that ,the effects were pretty good ,characters were good.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
