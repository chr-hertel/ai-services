I\u0027m not sure who this film was meant for. It had high school type of science with elementary/junior high humor. I\u0027m not sure yet, but I don\u0027t think I liked this movie at all. There were a couple parts I kind of went \"hmph\" in a laughing matter, but nothing that deserves a 5.8 rating on IMDb. What\u0027s with that by the way? I mean I see pretty decent movies on IMDb that are low, I mean like cute little comedies like Mannequin or Simply Irresistible that just make you feel good at the end. But somehow \"Evolution\" got a 5.8? I\u0027d just like to know how? It\u0027s really not that good of a movie. If this was from \"X-Files\" fans, wow. I really hope it\u0027s not, because there are more deserving movies of a higher rating. This has no structure, good acting, or actual comedy to it. Please, just review the film one more time before giving this film any points higher than a 3.\n\n2/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
