A great family film. I think it covered all bases, romance, action, comedy, mystery. If you have anything against violence, be warned it has some fight scenes. They are not bloody. I don\u0027t remember hearing any swearing. There is a lot of potty humor. This of course was a big hit with the youngsters in the crowd. Be careful how much you eat before seeing this if you have a weak stomach. Haha just kidding, it is not THAT gross. The children were all very funny and had very different personalities. I think any parent could relate to at least one of these children." }
