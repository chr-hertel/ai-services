So what if the dubbing is bad or the cinematography isn\u0027t up to snuff. These were meant as entertainment and should be judged as such. Were you entertained? Yes? Then it\u0027s a good movie and shut the f up! This particular movie\u0027s got a little bit of everything. Strippers, bad guys who dress like Bing Crosby, Lung Fei\u0027s worst hairdo ever, Angela Mao lookin\u0027 hot in a metallic jumpsuit, and Bruce Li sporting some major badass swagger. Oh yeah, and did I mention that the fat dude from Robin Williams\u0027 Popeye is in it. I won\u0027t tell you how he croaks, but let\u0027s just say that they don\u0027t make \u0027em like this anymore. And the theme song . . .the theme song ROCKS! I had it stuck in my head for days. If you\u0027re a fan of the late 70s / early 80s kung fu genre, then you owe it to yourself to check this out.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
