I think the movie is made in such a matter that it keeps you wondering what is going to be next and makes you forget about the little things: why did he kill the dumb guy when he was a professional killer? why when the gun was pointed to the kid\u0027s head it showed the bloddy house\u0027s background? why don\u0027t things add up?it\u0027s at half...who is the real Slevin?and so on...it is so absorbing that makes you forget...and I usually anticipate a lot. I think Slevin was given a role that is really matching with Bruce Willis\u0027s roles in other movies...ironic, funny and bad...especially tricky. All in one...what a hit. And where do we put that the Kansas City Shuffle was on us this whole time! Hat\u0027s off to the producer.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
