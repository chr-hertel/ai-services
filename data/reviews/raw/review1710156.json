It was quite obvious something was very wrong with the science and logic about halfway through. No legitimate science writer would be so incompetent, especially with the apparent high production values. Usually with so much money too burn you only hire the best writers and scientific advisor\u0027s. Alas when I did some research it turned out too be INTENTIONAL.\n\nNow a lot of science programs tries too replace Sagan\u0027s presence and prose with flashy graphics and music and even succeed. But one essential ingredient is the awe and wonder of accurately portrayed modern science, so predictably this fells flat, there really is no awe and wonder in mysticism and pseudo-science.\n\nAlso the narration by John Rhys-Davies is quite pleasant and quite apt, he is famous for his roles in fantasy and sci-fi films, which this film is just one of many.\n\nThis will get only one star if it wasn\u0027t for the eye-candy CGI and John Rhys-Davies.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
