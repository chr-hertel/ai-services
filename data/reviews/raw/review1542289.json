The general opinion in those days (1968)ridiculized Mussert, the man who stood on the wrong side during the war. Mussert being a brilliant engineer, made many improvements to the dutch infrastructure (Valleikanaal, improving the water-household in the central part of the Netherlands and more). Actually, when Mussert would not have made the decision of going into politics, the Netherlands, at least in the central part, would have looked totally different. The film itself is one of oral history, one of the most important resources of truth. It shows Paul Verhoeven in one of his outstanding qualities: being an honest man looking for the truth.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
