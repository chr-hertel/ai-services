Sure, there are a few funny lines in this movie, but I strongly disagreed with the people I attended with regarding the comedic level of this film. My friends were repeating lines and such afterwards, but I was thinking about how disappointed I was that I spent $8 seeing this, due to that equaling about 2 gallons of gas in this time period. The movie is sooooo inconsistent. For every funny moment, there were 3 awkward moments in which you knew a joke had just occurred, but it either A) Didn\u0027t deserve laughs, or B) Was laughed at because WIll Farrell said it and he\u0027s supposed to be funny, or C) Was laughed at because someones friend was laughing because Will Farrell is supposed to be funny all of the time. \n\nThe acting was \"hit or miss\" at times as well. It\u0027s easy to go into a film like this one and stop paying attention to the deliverance of lines, etc... Many times throughout this movie, it seemed as if the characters were reading off of cue cards.\n\nI am a very open-minded person when it comes to comedies - however, it seemed as if this one was just very sloppily put together. I think many of the new era comedic writers could learn a lot from the master of jokes, one liners and word play - Mr. Mel Brooks. \n\nThat\u0027s the best I could do without giving anything away.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
