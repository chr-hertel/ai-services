A few stunning sequences also appear, as a brilliant snowfall sequence set against the ebb and flow of some fantastic foreign ocean soon transitions into a surreal scene involving a beached whale and the erotic mysteries dwelling therein.\n\nWith the full moon shining brightly and the tide rising quickly, the two orphans are accompanied by the city\u0027s shadowy prime-mover/prisoner as they sail away at dawn. \"Fortunately, order and silence don\u0027t always prevail in the end\"...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
