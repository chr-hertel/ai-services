The idea is not super original by any means, but I think the performances made it seem refreshing. I thought that all of the actors played their parts well, especially DW Moffett. He made me cringe with annoyance and feel bad for him, which is no easy feat.\n\nI thought the storyline moved at a nice pace, but I feel that this film would have been improved by fleshing out more the relationship between Sonny and his son. I think that Trevor Wright is a great actor and that his talents were a little wasted in his small part.\n\nFor a first time feature for Mr. Phelps, I say congratulations as this film was very good and he really directed the performers well and wrote a script that is true to life. Well Done!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
