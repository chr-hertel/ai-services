His \u0027Body Of Lies\u0027 is an intricate complex thriller set mostly in Amman. What could have easily been clich√©d and stereotypical is instead carefully directed by Scott. He tries to balance the Arabs and Americans by showing both the bad guys and good guys such as the Jordanians are equally determined as the Americans in catching the bad guys, only their methods are different. At times the film is difficult to follow but the viewer manages to quickly catch up. At times the movie does remind one of Tony Scott\u0027s \u0027Spy Games\u0027 but then again the stories take different turns. The twists are clever and believable. The pace is steady and the background score is energetic. Leonardo Dicaprio again delivers a great performance. Though it has shades of the characters he played in \u0027Blood Diamond\u0027 and \u0027The Departed\u0027, it is in the end a role that he successfully pulls off. Crowe takes a different turn in playing a jerk of a boss and does an equally solid job. The supporting cast is strengthened by Mark Strong who plays Crowe\u0027s Jordanian counterpart and a charming Golshifteh Farahani who plays the love interest. In a nutshell, \u0027Body Of Lies\u0027 is an interesting thriller with enough sensible twists and suspense to engage the viewer and it successfully includes all the ingredients to be a successful movie experience." }
