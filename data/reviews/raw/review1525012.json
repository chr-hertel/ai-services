A intriguing story, of deception, death, the after life, and greed. This is a great film, with character you care about, suspense, romance, and a fresh script. Never saw a horror film that was so touching, so caring and so close to my heart. My wife and I really enjoyed it and I felt like these kids belonged to me and I had some sort of responsibility for them.\n\nVery well written story and a great cast make this little adventure a real treasure among horror films. The mix between horror and heartfelt compassion is surreal but gives the picture something Picasso-and-Dali-esquire (if there is such a thing as in film). Emotions usually not put together within the same context, this film creates something new, something not see - and more: not felt - before. Almost like a horror film for kids, I wanna say. But that wouldn\u0027t be correct either. Maybe more like a horror film for kids for adults, kinda. Anyway the point being is that the story is great, the acting is great, and the entertainment is great. It makes you feel feelings you\u0027ve never felt together before. We really liked it!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
