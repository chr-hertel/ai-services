To those who are saying that it is to violent, to much sex content, let me say this, that is what our world is coming to so deal with it. This could very well be the future of a major city even a country such as Cuba, note the similarities such as technology, situation and other things like that. However if you 2 dimensional critics get out of your little boxes, you would see that this film is great in its artistic style as well. The camera angles, the effects, the acting every thing is superb. I do not consider this a perfect film, but I do rank it a 10 out of 10, and I do believe future film makers will want to see this film and take many of its contents to use in their own films. I recently read Rodriguez and Miller are already planning what will be Sin City 2 and I cannot wait to see that one and I am sure it will be something artistic as well as innovative.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
