On Wednesday nights, I use to watch \"The West Wing\", but then that moved to Sunday. I started to watch \"Head Cases\", but to my great disappointment (though not surprise) that was cancelled. So, on a whim, I tried out \"Criminal Minds\". I have never made a better TV decision.\n\nCriminal Minds is a psychological thriller that keeps your undivided attention. Like Law \u0026 Order, no one character gets the direct star treatment. I have seen seven episodes, and I still do not have a favorite character (which is highly unusual for me). I love them all. Every single week, this is the only show I can hardly wait for.\n\nIf you like plots that keep you thinking and guessing while having plenty of physical and mention action, this show is definitely for you." }
