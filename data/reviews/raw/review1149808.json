Django sets up shop one day at the local whorehouse of a veritable ghost town set up between the two warring factions of Major Jackson (Eduardo Fajardo  Nightmare City, Oasis of the Zombies) with his red hooded militia and General Hugo (José Bódalo  Companeros) with his Mexican ex-patriots. Django\u0027s no nonsense style quickly puts him smack in the middle of the fun as secrets are revealed and sides are played against each other.\n\nSergio Corbucci (Super Fuzz) directs this classic Italian spaghetti western. The script (while being pretty typical of the genre) manages to make Django a classic antihero thanks for the most part to Franco Nero\u0027s portrayal. The script\u0027s lack of originality doesn\u0027t stop it from having some clever set-pieces, nasty violence and even a bit of dark humor (some of my favorite sequences: the clearing of the whorehouse \"Don\u0027t Touch my coffin\", the \"ear\" scene and the Mexican skeet shoot). The music is wonderful (topped of by a fun theme song sung by someone trying to channel Elvis). The cast of Italian regulars nail their parts with mucho gusto. Any fan of violent westerns Italiano-style should belly up to the bar and give Django\u0027s coffin of wonders a watch. But don\u0027t mess with it", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
