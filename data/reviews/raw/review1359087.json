It also does not help that this movie came on the heels of Prisoner of Azkaban, which is so far my favorite of the films, and was masterfully directed by Alfonso Cuaron. I felt that this movie contained almost no character development. It seems as if the characters hardly ever even converse. The movie also felt very rushed, as it offers practically no justification for what happens in it. I know that it can be difficult to cram a 700 or so page book into a two and a half hour movie, but it has been done before, and there must be a better way than this.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
