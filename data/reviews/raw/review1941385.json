She plays a journalist, Lauren, who goes to a Mexican town to investigate the murders of young women. The numbers are reported to be in the hundreds but are actually in the thousands. The government wants to hide it. A young woman survives one of the attacks and Lauren wants to interview her but certain people want to prevent that from happening. She gets help from a guy who runs a local paper. She begins to find out that some important, rich people may be connected to the murders. She sets herself up as bait and gets a terrifying experience. But in the end the whole story remains unsolved.\n\nThe story was somewhat interesting and easy to follow.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: If you like Lopez, then you\u0027ll like this. If you come across it on cable, it\u0027s worth watching.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
