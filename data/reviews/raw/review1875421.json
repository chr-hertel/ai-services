That will mark her whole life and her relationships. She lives obsessed by death.\n\n\"I am Dina\" has a powerful and promising beginning, but as the story advances everything turns a little bit confusing. It looks like a second rate Bronte sisters tale, and it gets much worst as the ending approaches.\n\nNot even that red-head beauty called Maria Bonnevie makes the movie a little more attractive. Boring (big time)\n\n*My rate: 4/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
