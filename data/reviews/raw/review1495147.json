In this one, Richmond is some kind of advertising man who comes up with a concept for a women\u0027s clothing campaign (I think, based on the drawings we see) called THE THREE SPRINGS. Soon, various eccentric gangster types and crooked businessmen start expressing an interest in the campaign, feeling as though Richmond is actually making a reference to something else with the title and they are trying to cover that up. I won\u0027t give away the plot and say WHAT they think he\u0027s referring to with the ad campaign because that is the device that puts the plot, such as it is, in motion. Studios needed to churn out a certain number of b-movies per season, and often a project that might have sounded good on paper gets locked into the production schedule and it gets made even though it doesn\u0027t fully gel. That\u0027s what the problem is here. Each scene, on its own, is entertaining. Richmond--a kind of square-jawed, self-deprecating leading man who probably best resembles George Clooney among today\u0027s stars--is always a pleasure to watch. The top-billed star here Stephanie Bachelor--who was in films for a brief six year period, and who seemed to get leading roles mostly at Republic--as Richmond\u0027s girlfriend. She looks great and delivers the arguing-couple romantic banter well, but there\u0027s not much depth to her character. As for Adele Mara, she\u0027s given a thankless role here as a kind of femme-fatale, but we\u0027re not really sure how deep is her involvement with the bad guys, and the way the film disposes of her character cannot be excused. Unless my copy of the film is cut (and it\u0027s the Hollywood Television Service print, so it may be), I can\u0027t believe this script made it past ANY editor. My wife and I looked at each other as the \"End\" credit appeared, and asked, \"What about Adele Mara\"? We know what happens to her, but it is never resolved. WHAT??????? On the good side, this film is entertaining in pieces--the supporting cast (with such fine performers as Gerald Mohr and Gregory Gay) is colorful, there\u0027s a lot of witty romantic banter between Richmond and Bachelor AND Richmond and Mara. It\u0027s just that the plot doesn\u0027t hold together, the events in themselves don\u0027t command attention, and there\u0027s a rushed feel to many scenes as though the attitude was \"let\u0027s get this in the can quickly.\" Some of the fights are the most phony I\u0027ve seen in a Republic film--a studio known for its excellent stunt-men. Richmond and the bad guys seem as though they were just instructed to pull the punches because the stunt men couldn\u0027t make it today. Still, it was not an unpleasant way to kill 60 minutes and b-movie and Richmond fans will enjoy it. Bachelor and Mara are both wonderfully attractive and witty leading ladies. Just don\u0027t expend much energy or cost in trying to find a copy.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
