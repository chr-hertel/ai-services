A guy, called \"Doc\", finds her plans and try to avoid the destruction of the human race. \"Carnosaur\" is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is impossible to write a summary of such a crap. The story does not make sense, the characters are horribly developed, the \"special effects\" looks like one of those dinosaur \"Made in Paraguay or China\". When I saw the name of Diane Ladd in the credits and a production of Roger Corman, I imagined a big joke with \"Jurassic Park\", since Diane Ladd is the mother of Laura Dern. But the movie is so cheesy that never works. I like trash movies, like \"Braindead\", \"Tromeo and Juliet\", \u0027Bad Taste\" etc... But \"Carnosaur\" is not a trash, but a crap Movie. If I can give an advice, I would say: Do not waste your time watching it! My vote is two.\n\nTitle (Brazil: \"Carnosauro\" (\"Carnosaur\")", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
