It appeared to me like another action film about hit-man. I many times heard other people talking how great this film is and I couldn\u0027t understand how this movie is different from others. Now after few years I\u0027ve watched it again, and now I realised it. Back then I was into action movies, so I\u0027ve watched movies only to see some action, I didn\u0027t care much about a plot. This movie has some impressive action sequences, which were so beautifully filmed, that every minute of it was very enjoyable. But action isn\u0027t the most important thing about this film. What\u0027s important is an original story about unusual relationships between contract killer and a teenage girl. What else is good about this film is the colorfulness of it. Jean Reno was typical Jean Reno and that\u0027s good, he made a pretty original hit-man. Even more I liked Gary Oldman\u0027s performance, he always plays bad guys in movies so well, I think the movie would be much worse, if Stansfield was played by other guy.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
