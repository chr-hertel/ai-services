The storytelling technique is plain even by the standards of 1911, i.e. camera set-ups, editing, and acting are \"pre-Griffith,\" but the result is earnest and workmanlike. The story concerns an indisputable injustice and aims squarely at the viewers\u0027 emotions. This is the sort of movie that could have been easily understood by all audiences, including new immigrants still struggling to learn English, for pantomime carries the day and title cards are sparse and simple; beyond that, the basic scenario is applicable across cultures and is still relevant today. Only in the Way is an examination of the friction that can arise between the generations when an elderly parent comes to stay with family, and although the film ends on a note of hopeful reconciliation this is the sort of conflict that seldom works out so smoothly in reality.\n\nOur story centers on Marie, a little girl who lives with her parents and walks with the aid of a crutch. When Marie\u0027s paternal grandmother comes to stay she is delighted, but it quickly becomes clear that Marie\u0027s mother is hostile to the old woman and unhappy that she\u0027s moved in. To all appearances Grandma is a sweet lady: she brings her granddaughter a kitten and seems affectionate and mild-mannered. But when she proves to be clumsy around the house Marie\u0027s mother gives her husband a harsh ultimatum: Either She Goes or I Go. Marie\u0027s father, who is something of a wimp, promptly knuckles under and escorts his mother to a \u0027Home for the Aged,\u0027 where he leaves her. Little Marie is distraught about the situation, so she takes her kitten and hobbles off to find her grandmother. Ultimately, the little girl brings about a rapprochement between her mother and grandmother and all ends happily.\n\nIn a film running only 10 minutes or so there isn\u0027t much time for \u0027back-story,\u0027 so we have to assume that Marie\u0027s mother has some unexplained reason for the instant hostility she shows her mother-in-law, something stemming from past events. And in the finale, her sudden cheerful turn-about is just as swift and unexpected as her earlier enmity appeared to be. To put it mildly Marie\u0027s mother comes off as emotionally unstable, but that\u0027s probably because the film\u0027s brief running time didn\u0027t allow for a deeper exploration of the family dynamic. As it stands the central theme of Only in the Way is the close bond that forms between children and grandparents. It looks like a pretty good illustration of the quip attributed to comedian Sam Levenson, i.e. that the reason children and grandparents get along so well is that they have a common enemy!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
