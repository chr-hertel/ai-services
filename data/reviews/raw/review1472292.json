If you\u0027ve seen one Bergman film, you\u0027ve seen them all. The poor man put a lot of effort into exploring life\u0027s BIG issues but never seemed to get any closer to an answer about any of them. As I\u0027ve become a more sophisticated movie watcher, I find Bergman\u0027s style nearly intolerable. His films are airless and stifling, and hopelessly pretentious. It\u0027s been a long time since I\u0027ve seen \"The Seventh Seal,\" and maybe I would have a better opinion of it on a second viewing, but frankly, I would rather watch \"Snakes on a Plane\" than watch this film again.\n\nOne of the famous images in this film is the shot of the Reaper leading a dance of death across a stark hillside. Woody Allen aped it in his 1975 film \"Love and Death.\" \n\nGrade: B", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
