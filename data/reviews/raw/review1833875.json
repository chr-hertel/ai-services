Caine and Robertson look like men, not wimpy little effeminate preppies which we\u0027re served and rammed down our throats en masse nowadays. Michael Caine participated in the Korean war as a soldier, while Denholm Elliot spent several years as a Japanese P.O.W. in WW II; what\u0027s the toughest ordeal Casey Affleck ever had to go through? A broken nail? And it partially shows on screen, of course.\n\nThe main drawback is the length; I saw no reason for this plot to use up over 2 hours of screen time. A minor problem was the occasional mumbling.\n\nOne of the things I liked here is that there was a more realistic way of looking at World War II. In recent decades we\u0027ve had U.S. liberals and other clueless Leftists tell us how \"valid\" and \"noble\" that war was, as opposed to other wars that came later, that were supposedly totally immoral, unclean, nasty and vile. However, there is no such thing as a \"pure\" or \"sanitized\" war. The lack of discipline, morality and even courage among some of the British troops in this film is a refreshing break from the kind of silly over-glorification of WW II - especially the way this stands in contrast to the over-vilification of wars fought by America in the decades after that.\n\nJudging by Caine\u0027s memories (from his autobiography) related to filming TLTH, a documentary on the making of the film would have been fascinating to watch." }
