I think any one from any culture can relate to it. We\u0027re all dealing with cultural fusion and as we encounter diverse cultures and fall in love, we all have to stretch ourselves and gain appreciation and understanding of each other.\n\nI found it sweet, charming, funny, engaging, and it\u0027s beautifully filmed and performed by a dynamite cast.\n\nDoes Scott Bakula EVER age?! He looks great, as always. It\u0027s nice to have him and Robert Beltran in one movie--two of my favorites. What a treat! \n\nOther great movies in this vein: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" and \"Catfish in Black Bean Sauce\".\n\nThe DVD commentary about the \"making of\" is also engaging. This film is a \"Mom and Pop\" venture, with the lead\u0027s real-life son as her movie son. That relationship adds a wonderful dimension to their scenes together.\n\nThe Latino community pulled together to get it made, so it\u0027s really from a grassroots effort straight from the heart of a community that needs it voice. Bravo!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
