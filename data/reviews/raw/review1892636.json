This one was fantastic. It basically re-invents the Hulk franchise. There\u0027s a nifty little nod to the Hulk TV show opening also. Ed Norton scores as Bruce Banner. Liv Tyle is good as Betty and Tim Roth is awesome. Why isn\u0027t this guy a big star? This is a non-stop adrenaline rush...cool chase scenes with Bruce Banner and amazing Hulk action set pieces make this Hulk a truly entertaining and promising start to another big Marvel franchise. There\u0027s a few cool surprise cameos in the film too. I wont give away the surprises...although one of the TV spots does (!!!!!)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
