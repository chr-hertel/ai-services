How wrong they were!", "reviewBody": "I could not agree with you more that the raters of the Looney Toons movie just missed the boat, the train, the point, and the punchline! But I think they were looking for more sex, blood, violence, thrill, profanity and nudity. They reflect the times when more people would rather see these things than watch a wholesome family-oriented piece such as this. This movie is rated PG for one reason: Yosemite Sam\u0027s mouth. And even there, the worst he says is our old favorite replacement for the F-word, \"Fragnabbit.\" \n\nSo what\u0027s wrong with this movie? In a word, it\u0027s too family! It\u0027s fun for all ages, and cute without being too cutesy. Even Steve Martin plays it to the hilt, and I never was a fan of his character.\n\nSo I\u0027m with you 100% that the reviewers who dissed and doused the Looney Toons movie need to get a life and a funny bone transplant... FAST!!\n\nThis movie is 92 minutes of side-splitting laughter, and well worth the chest plasters and rib stitches! Most of all, it\u0027s a movie the whole family can enjoy without all the politically correct under-rated adult content that makes most of today\u0027s PG movies too old for our children. For the young, it\u0027s high entertainment that doesn\u0027t stoop to too much violence. For the emotionally young, it\u0027s worth the stroll down memory lane with our favorite Looney Toons from bygone times. I think every WB character ever created appears in this film at least once, and long enough to be recognized.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
