Which this failed writer takes his social misfit friend before he gets married. But along the way, they meet two attractive woman Maya (Virginia Madsen) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh). Which they return their interest. But Miles has tough time with Jack, since he\u0027s cheating around before he\u0027s getting married and their week together isn\u0027t as well planned as he thought it was. While Miles tries to have an relationship with Maya, who\u0027s return his affections.\n\nDirected by Alexander Payne (About Schmidt, Citizen Ruth, Election) made an excellent, laughter-filled dramatic comedy with superb performances by the cast. Church and Madsen were Oscar nominated for their roles. Director Payne was also nominated for an Oscar for Best Director. It was also nominated for Best Picture. This is an intelligent comedy for the adults. Sadly, Giamatti didn\u0027t received an Oscar for Best Actor for his brilliant comic/sad role.\n\nDVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an fine-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an humorous audio commentary by the actors:Giamatti and Church, Deleted Scenes, Behind the Scenes featurette and more. Director Payne and Screenwriter Jim Talyor (Jurassic Park 3) won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. Which the picture is based on a novel by Rex Pickett. This exhilaration movie is a smart, funny and touching. This was one of the most critical acclaimed films of 2004. This is worth seeing.
