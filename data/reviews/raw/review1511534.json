They just took the same basic story and changed it. In this one the mummy is named Kharis (Tom Tyler) and was buried alive while trying to revive his dead lover. Now it seems her tomb has been found and is going to be opened. Kharis is revived by an evil high priest (George Zucco) to kill the desecrater\u0027s of her tomb...\n\nGood mixture of humor (some of it actually funny) and horror. The film moves quick and Tyler is actually pretty good as the mummy. Some of the closeups of his face are pretty frightening (the eyes and mouth were optically darkened by the studio). They also used some very impressive sets from another movie. This is also the first movie to introduce Kharis and start up the legend of the tana leaves (which give Kharis his strength).\n\nThe acting is OK. Dick Foran plays the strong handsome hero, Wallace Ford plays the goofy sidekick and Peggy Moran is the love interest. This is basically a quick, fun and (sometimes) scary monster movie--easily one of Universal\u0027s best. Worth catching--it\u0027s only 67 minutes.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
