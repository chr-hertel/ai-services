Check. Inciting Force? Check. Conflict? Check. etc.", "reviewBody": "A \"popcorn-drama\" is what comes to mind. This comedic-drama exhibits all the essential theatrical-elements to create a \"good story\". That being said, it seemed much of the storyline was \"forced\", meaning, several scenes seemed to happen for-the-sake of exploring that particular \"literary element\". The result of this is an exhaustive view of each character, making them seem rather one-sided, which isn\u0027t necessarily bad, but I prefer deeper, more dynamic characters..\n\nThe story itself was well-told, dialogue was entertaining, acting was decent, but I had higher expectations for this one. To sum it up, this movie was, simply, \"simple\".", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
