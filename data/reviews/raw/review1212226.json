They plan on a Caribbean cruise instead. Their neighbors and co-workers treat them like Mr. and Mrs Scrooge and just as they are about to leave, the daughter calls and says she is coming home for Christmas. OMG!\n\nI never have seen a movie where the first half was a total disaster and the second half, while not all that good, actually saves itselfÂ….barely. The first half was like an eight-year old getting a Brownie movie camera and deciding to make a movie. No, wait. That does a great injustice to the eight-year old, who I am sure would have made the first half of this movie a lot better. The first half was completely dumb. And, there was room for it to be great. \n\nJohn Grisham wrote the book Skipping Christmas, which is a far better title than what we have. I am sure Mr. Grisham is seeking his lawyers for his reputation being besmirched with this disaster. He didn\u0027t write the play-script and should have. \n\nTim Allen knew this was bad and he played it straight as did Ms. Curtis. In fact everyone did okay acting-wise. It was the script itself that was bad. Yes, and the direction was bad too. This all turns around, somewhat, when the news of the daughter returning is announced. What helps this turn-around is guess what? The music. Christmas music has a way of not letting you see the bad things. You sing along and everyone is happy. Cheap shot, I say.\n\nFunny moments were few. Luther Krank making his front yard a virtual ice rink so the neighbors can\u0027t stand on the lawn and harass them. Here the neighbors slipped all over the place and that was funny and the scene should have lasted longer. There were laughs here, but the scene was cut too short. Don\u0027t we laugh when someone slips on a banana peel or ice? Sure we do. Don\u0027t we want to keep watching someone slip on a banana peel or on ice? Sure we do. We could watch it all day long. Cheech Martin as a policeman with dead-pan humor gave us the rest of the laughs. He should have had a bigger part.\n\nDan Aykroyd looked like Tom Hanks with a fuller face. Can you see the resemblance?\n\nYes, it is a disaster and if it weren\u0027t for the music and some pretty good dialogue in the second half, this would not have saved itself. But it did. \n\nDo we still have the Peace Corps?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
