It seems this pair have done something rare these days--specialize in making independent shorts. And they have made many--mostly of very good quality. Now it\u0027s hard to really review this one very well because the film is only about 2 minutes long! This is short even for one of their films.\n\nThe film opens with a guy eating some cereal and he finds a screw in the package. The film then cuts to the factory where it was made and you see that construction is going on all around the place. Later, he\u0027s eating a different cereal from a different company, though I won\u0027t reveal what happens next.\n\nEntertaining, mildly funny and also mildly gross. It\u0027s the sort of film that teens will love and immature adults (like myself) will also get a kick seeing.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
