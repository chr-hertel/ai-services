Some of the 3D computer shots actually looked like real pictures of real people. I definitely recommend the movie, and it was entertaining, but it did not follow the original story all that closely, which was a bit of a disappointment for me.\n\nAlso, the first half of the movie seemed a little odd to me. It really seemed to me that the Grendel was like a person who had noisy neighbors. Ya know? Like, have you ever had neighbors who played loud music at all hours of the night? And all you wanted to do is sleep, but they are partying all night long and you can hear them, so they keep you up? And you just get to a point where you are so frustrated with them and you want them to just shut up, so you bust down their door and start biting all their heads off? That is pretty much how the first part of the movie plays out. And then, after the Grendel kicks everybody\u0027s ass and kills the party so he can finally get some peace and quiet, he leaves kind of like, \"Keep the music down or I will come back again and kill you all!\" I\u0027ve had neighbors like that, so I totally understood where the Grendel was coming from! But Beowulf is a great hero and it is good to see a good movie about one of history\u0027s greatest heroes.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
