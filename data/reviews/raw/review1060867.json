Not an epic, more of a short story... not unlike an actual nightmare...\n\nThe acting was very natural, and low key, certainly not \"bad\"... Very Good actually, in its simplicity... I thought the dialog as well was believable and unusually natural...\n\nThe videography/cinematography whatever, was creative, not irritatingly amateurish as some here have accused...\n\nIt was if they simply had a professional videographer documenting their circumstance...\n\nTheir ordeal being one of my fears, I was pretty stressed...\n\n7 out of 10...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
