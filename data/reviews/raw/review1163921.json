The visuals on this movie was just mind blowing!!! The actors are amazing, the visuals and special effects are amazing!!! The only problem with this movie was the story line. I\u0027m a HUGE MARVEL FAN and they had the story all wrong. The story was similar, but just not correct enough. First of all, in the real story Spider-Man could not make his own webbing from his body. He had to create web cartridges with science!! Plus, the way uncle Ben dies is Drastically incorrect!!! In the real story, uncle Ben dies when a robber breaks into their house, and this robber was a man who robbed the manager of a TV station!! Overall however, this movie blew me away!! I got over the incorrect story line because everything else was simply AMAZING!!! TRUST ME ON MOVIES!!! IF YOU WATCH THE MOVIES I COMMENTED AND READ MY COMMENTS, YOU WILL AGREE!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
