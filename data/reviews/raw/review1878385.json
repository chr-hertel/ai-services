My 7th favorite movie ever. I love this movieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. Du du da da du da da du du du da du du da da da du da du da du da du da du. Great movie. Steven Spielberg\u0027s best. Indiana Jones and The Raiders of the lost ark is the best of the series. I have yet to see the new one but once I see it I will review it. Raiders is a greaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat film. It is a film that most people have seen. It has a very big cult following. I am a fan of the series and I think Raiders Of the Lost Ark is the best of the series. It is a fact. If you hate these movies, then I will try to track you down and have a whip with me and whip you(just kidding, we all have different tastes). This is a great film. It\u0027s beginning is infamous. What more? Harrison Ford is perfect for his role. All I have to say.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
