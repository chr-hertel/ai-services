Roman Holiday is in my top three movies of all time. I love Italy. This movie is putrid. The reason? It is a god awful story, horribly constructed, and utterly unbelievable. In order for any romantic comedy to work, you have to believe why the two characters love each other, you have to believe that they were meant to be together. This generally works best when the love is slowly built up, even if the time period covered is very short (as in one day for Roman Holiday). With this film, we\u0027re supposed to believe this woman is in love with a man because of a name? Give me a break! We\u0027re supposed to have sympathy for this ditz who\u0027s willing to leave her fiancé in the lurch because of a name? We\u0027re supposed to believe that Robert Downey, Jr. falls in love with her in 5 minutes, when this woman clearly has psychological problems? This doesn\u0027t even get into all the clichés, Tomei\u0027s bad acting, etc. Best part of the film is the glimpse or two of Italian scenery. I\u0027m shocked Jewison even agreed to direct this film with such an obviously flawed script. I guess he thought he had \"Moonstruck in Italy,\" and that he could make it work.\n\nWrong.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
