Not an action western.", "reviewBody": "TAOJJBTCRF is a long dramatised documentary of what the title says. Some people here didn\u0027t catch the suspense that runs through it - basically who will die next? - and weren\u0027t seduced by the top-notch period recreation. Some picked up on the feeling that it might be bit of a Brad Pitt vanity project, allowing him to play a pantomime villain for once. He certainly does Jesse James like a cross between a young Burl Ives and a Midwest Tony Soprano. But for me, it worked. It sagged when the gang members became hard to distinguish, the casual disappearance of Frank James was a bit well, casual, and as others have said the pistol shots seem strangely muffled (a period detail?). To be honest you do get to the point where you feel \u0027I\u0027ve watched two hours, I might as well stick with it\u0027, but if you take it at face value as a historical psychological study - of Bob Ford and of Jesse (and how the legend was what people wanted), and don\u0027t take it as seriously as it occasionally takes itself (the voice-over is a flaw in that respect), you\u0027ll be able to enjoy how beautifully made it is. It\u0027s epic without having a huge cast or massive number of setpieces, and rewards concentration, a bit like a long stage play put on screen. If you \u0027get\u0027 Ingmar Bergman movies, or liked Deadwood, you\u0027ll probably enjoy it. If not, move along, nothing to see here.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
