He was incredibly funny as he talked about the hassles that he had to go through to get this film made.\n\nIt was definitely worth it. This film really cuts to the core of human relationships. It deals with love fidelity, and the value and pitfalls of secrets and honesty. Yes, it challenges society\u0027s mores, but in a sweet and very funny way.\n\nThe casting and writing are both fantastic.\n\nThe only major drawback is the graininess of some of the digital photography.\n\nThis film may end up being portrayed as a gimmick movie, but that is really an afterthought to the humanity of this fine film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
