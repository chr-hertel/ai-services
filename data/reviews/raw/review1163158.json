What\u0027s the saying...\"Laughter is the best medicine\"? While the show isn\u0027t hilarious, I think it takes a very serious subject and lightens the mood around it a little. I really feel that people take themselves and their \"problems\" a little too seriously most of the time.\n\nThat\u0027s just my humble opinion...I\u0027m sure someone out there without a sense of humor will take offense. Too bad! I mean really, now. There is famine in, what, 2/3rds of the world, hurricanes and tsunamis are destroying parts of our planet and killing thousands, and there are actually people getting upset over a stupid TV show. Here\u0027s an idea: if you don\u0027t like what \"Starved\" has to say, don\u0027t watch it, but don\u0027t act like it\u0027s supposed to be some show like Intervention that is helping people. And, I think that saying that people with eating disorders would be offended or possibly even cause them problems is saying that people with eating disorders are stupid. As I previously said, I have an eating disorder and I am much more offended by people assuming that I am too dumb to realize that this is just a TV show...not real life!" }
