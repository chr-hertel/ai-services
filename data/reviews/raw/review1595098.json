Veber is the mainstay of conventional French screen comedy. He wrote the Cage aux Folles screenplays and directed The Dinner Game/Le Dîner de cons and The Closet/Le placard (the latter starring Daniel Auteuil and Gérard Depardieu) and lot of others. The only trouble is, Veber has done so many of these things now their action is routine-ized. You can see the jokes coming well ahead, especially the visual ones. And some of the jokes are so clunky. A doctor who has to be treated by his patientscome on! Is that really funny enough to carry on to scene after scene? This time Veber\u0027s every-guy character François Pignon (here Gad Elmaleh) gets pulled into a scheme by megabucks CEO Levasseur (Auteuil) to extricate himself from charges that he\u0027s been cheating on his wife Christine (Kristin Scott Thomas) with his mistress of two years, \"top-model\" Elena (Alice Taglioni), which obviously he indeed has. A paparazzo has snapped Levasseur in a compromising scene squabbling with the beauty, but Pignon was walking by and his face is also in the background of the tabloid picture. If Levasseur can make it look like Pignon is the boyfriend (don\u0027t look into that too closely) he\u0027s in the clear.\n\nPignon has just been shot down after proposing to his childhood sweetheart Emilie (Virginie Ledoyen). His roommate and fellow parking valet (voiturier) at a posh restaurant, Richard (Dany Boon), has just moved out. His girlfriend is 32,000+ Euros in debt at the bookstore she\u0027s recently opened. Levasseur talks Elena into moving in with Pignon and pretending to be his girlfriend for the paparazzi to get himself off the hook. Pignon is asking only the 32,000+ Euroes as payment, but Elena has been promised a whopping 20 million Euro guarantee that when this is over, Levasseur will eventually marry her. If Christine were to divorce Levasseur she could take 60% of his company\u0027s stock with her. He doesn\u0027t really want that. His trouble is he doesn\u0027t really want to give up Elena either. He wants his dough, he wants his company, he wants his wife, and he wants his mistress. He\u0027s a pretty greedy guy. A snag is Christine has detectives carefully sussing all this out. He hasn\u0027t really fooled anybody, except a few paparazzi, who could care less.\n\nVeber uses glitz to liven things up and moderates that diet with niceness. As in Hollywood, moral virtue wins out against the ravages of raw capitalism and somewhat against everyday experience. Of course bad guys do get caught, but not as easily as this. The fancy cars the valets get to drive dazzle us just as does the top-model\u0027s beauty (and a Chanel-Lagerfeld runway show happens with the elegantly cadaverous Lagerfeld himself on hand). Kirsten Scott Thomas adds impeccable class to her minor role as the wronged but unflappable wife.\n\nIf these were all poor people none of this would happen. This is a case of Money Makes Funny.\n\nThe joke-message is money doesn\u0027t really matter (I guess). Elena would rather ditch Levasseur than get his 20-million-Euro bribe. She actually likes Pignon  he\u0027s a decent fellow and he\u0027s got those big bright eyes  and she gradually builds up his ego while getting a lesson in decency from him, in case she needs one. (One would think she would, but that isn\u0027t gone into.) Pignon\u0027s girlfriend Emilie relents and accepts his hand and in this process Elena becomes a sort of fashion star fairy godmother.\n\nVeber doesn\u0027t engineer a splashy finale. Things end not with a bang but a whimper  Pignon telling Levasseur off and leaving him on a lonely road in his car.\n\nRichard Berry as Maître Foix, Levasseur\u0027s lawyer who arranges all the \"stand-in\" business, gives one of the film\u0027s juiciest performances, with all-black outfits and tight close-ups to highlight his efficient, plummily amoral manner. It\u0027s a nice moment when he asks Levasseur \"May I speak to you as a friend?\" and Levasseur quickly replies, \"No.\" Auteuil, with his polished lack of affect, is perfect for his role.\n\nThis isn\u0027t as ingenious as The Closet or The Dinner Game (and other earlier Veber comedies) and maybe that\u0027s why we can see the wheels turning so clearly. It\u0027s entertaining but lacks wit. There is a great French tradition here but it lies in shreds and tatters. The timing is good (if obvious) and the acting is polished and, where it has room to be, appealing. But this is like doing a crossword puzzle. When it\u0027s over, you\u0027re done with it forever.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
