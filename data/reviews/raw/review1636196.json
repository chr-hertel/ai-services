I was so supremely impressed with this at the time I saw it on PBS that I have no trouble now remembering the title immediately, along with the names Rosalind Chao and Chris Cooper, even after all these years. So, I just had to come here now while I\u0027m thinking of it and register my approval.\n\nIf this were available on DVD, I\u0027d buy it today. But it seems to me that what America really needs, entertainment-wise, is an American Playhouse anthology on DVD. If The American Film Theatre can put out a fourteen-volume anthology (in three sets), and if we can get \"Fifty Years of Janus Films\" in one giant collection, why not American Playhouse?" }
