Why he would decide to do a remake of the original \"Halloween\" is anyone\u0027s guess. Granted his original works have been far from masterpieces, but with such innate skill, one wonders what Zombie would be able accomplish as a for-hire genre director. Instead he continues to wallow in the muck of the horror film gutter and debase his audiences through the display of his own sick obsessions.\n\nThe actual remake portion of the film (the last 45 minutes) is fairly well done and probably would\u0027ve worked had Zombie not made the three teenage girls stalked by Michael Myers such annoying and unsympathetic characters. The \"chase\" scenes are well staged and Zombie throws in some decent scenarios not found in the original. The climax is an entertaining combination of classic 80\u0027s style horror where you are screaming at the female lead for being so stupid and modern horror grisliness where you feel sick to your stomach after enduring it.\n\nZombie leads up to this with 45 minutes of wildly offensive exposition giving us details on Michael Myers\u0027 life we never cared to know. Part of the thrill of the original was the mystery behind Myers\u0027 insanity. Zombie plays up the \"tortured childhood\" aspect in his signature white-trash-nightmare style and makes the adult Myers too superhuman to be truly feared. It\u0027s a calculated gamble to add this new layer, and it doesn\u0027t pay off. In the end, \"Halloween\" is perfectly watchable for horror buffs, but why would anyone waste their time with Zombie\u0027s monster of a movie when they could just sit down with the original?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
