For those who have seen it you should know what I\u0027m talking about, for those who haven\u0027t, do the following- 1) Go and borrow/buy season 1 and watch all the seasons chronologically otherwise some moments in the more recent seasons will have no impact on you whatsoever 2) Go watch it now, stop going on about \"oh, Lost is so great, it\u0027s all about these people who are lost and they don\u0027t know where they are cos they\u0027re lost, it\u0027s great cos it goes on for ages but never really gets anywhere\" because quite frankly Lost is not good enough to kiss Kiefer Sutherland\u0027s backside.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
