It\u0027s a far cry from the massive epics that Lean is best known for, although there are links between the early Lean and the later Lean. The focus couldn\u0027t be much more different, but just like Laurence of Arabia nearly twenty years later, Lean (or rather Coward, since it\u0027s his play) is here telling the story of historical events through the experiences of individual, well-defined characters.\n\nOne thing that\u0027s always struck me about these early David Lean pictures is how similar his technique was to that of Alfred Hitchcock. His subject matter was vastly different, but you could say this is what it would look like had Hitch made dramas. You can see this right from the opening shot, as the camera pans over the Thames then homes in on one house, echoing the beginning of many a Hitchcock thriller  like Hitch, Lean is here saying \"this could be any home, any family\". He shows similarities with Hitch in the way he arranges the actors in a shot, and there is some fairly classy handling of characters emotional states  a more gentle take on Hitchcock\u0027s aim to always show character psychology.\n\nIt\u0027s a mystery to me why this was made in colour. For a start, Technicolor was not easy to get hold of in Britain at this time (for example The Archers had to delay making A Matter of Life and Death til after the war was over). There\u0027s nothing about the subject matter that really demands colour, and to be honest Lean doesn\u0027t make that good use of it (he was to demonstrate great skill with black and white in subsequent films up until the mid 1950s). The only reason I can think of is to inject more realism into it. Also, in spite of its small focus, the picture does seem to give itself the airs and sweep of a \"big\" picture, what with the grand orchestral score and the location shooting.\n\nThere\u0027s some good acting talent on display here. Stanley Holloway and Frank Mills are great in their supporting roles, but the real standout is Celia Johnson. Her performance is both powerful and naturalistic. She may not have had the looks to be given many lead roles, but she really was one of the best English actors of her generation.\n\nThis Happy Breed was probably quite something for the British public at the time of its release. It wasn\u0027t that common to see a film depicting a normal, average family having normal, average experiences, particularly where these were related to events in recent memory. However, it hasn\u0027t aged well, and looking at it now I\u0027d say it probably says more about the inside of Noel Coward\u0027s head than it does about the British people or the British experience in the inter war years. The dialogue is full of meaningless waffle about Britain or the British character. There are some rather obvious attempts to represent a variety of political standpoints through different characters, although This Happy Breed is extremely subjective in its portrayal of actual historical events.\n\nAnother clue as to why This Happy Breed was such a major success at the time is its bolstering optimism. David Lean is often said to have captured the post war mood with his late-40s output, and here in 1944 he seems to be looking forward to the end of the war. This Happy Breed starts with the end of the last war, and ends with the beginning of the then-current one, and there is that air of \"we took it before, we can do it again\". But unlike the superlative war and post-war films of Michael Powell, or Lean\u0027s own Brief Encounter, no matter how timely it was in its day, this is no great picture here and now.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
