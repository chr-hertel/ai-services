It\u0027s suppose to be a student film, but the story, acting and cinematography is better then I have seen in a while. And I have seen some bad production in student films, but not this one they must have had some dough to pour into it. I read the review and I have to agree the acting was flawless. I was wishing though that I could see more of the back-story of all the characters, cause how do people get to that point? I loved all the characters but especially creepy Ben, that guy was a freak in disguise. This movie made want to see every film noir I could get my hands on. It\u0027s not for sale cause it\u0027s a student film but if you get a chance to see it do it. Its weird 6 people in totaled voted before me and 5 people gave it a 9 or 10, yet it\u0027s score is 1 star, crazy. GREAT FILM!
