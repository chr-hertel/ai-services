The story is being told through the eyes of a little girl, but Richard Gere, Brooke Adams, and Sam Shepard are the stars of the film. It was directed by Terrence Malick, who has made only a handful of films, but each one is unique and is a gem. This movie is no exception either. It is more or less a love story between two men in love with the same woman. The movie uses this story as a backdrop for its stunning and memorable images. Many scenes are likely to stay in the viewers\u0027 minds for a long time.\n\nWhat is lacking in the movie, though, is a strong screenplay and complete character development. Many scenes leave left me empty simply because there was not enough dialog, and the characters seemed passive. Maybe the movie was supposed to be that way, but those two aspects are its main flaws. If it had better dialog and characters, it probably would have been one of the best films I\u0027ve ever seen. Nonetheless, \u0027Days of Heaven\u0027 is often a beautiful journey to another place and another time. The movie is depressing, but that time period and place was one of great struggle and misery.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
