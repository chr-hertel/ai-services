I wish I could recall the name of the original, but it is seen far less than this remake. Michael Maltese also wrote the original. The book gag is in the original, only Porky throws \"The Falcon\" and gets clobbered with \"The Falcon Returns.\" I believe (not 100% certain), that Sylvester\u0027s 9 lives singing the \"Sextet from Lucia\" at the end of \"Back Alley Op-roar\" is a straight dub from the original\u0027s closing gag.\n\nThere are some great gags here, and tho\u0027 maybe overused, I\u0027ve always enjoyed where a singer takes in a little alum, tries to sing, and then we watch his head shrink to the size of a pin while his key goes up several octaves!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
