Brigitte Bardot was, of course major eye candy then, and that is the major charm of this film. It seems like the plot from the movie based on \"The Odyssey\" is obviously supposed to parallel the relationship between Paul and Camille. Or, more likely, the relationship is the model for the re-interpretation of Homer. A little interesting are the brief scenes which refer to the pistol Paul carried. I suppose it must have just been mis-direction, as it eventually had no bearing on the denouement of the plot. If it were a more modern movie, or one where the director was not in complete control, I would have thought that the film was focus-grouped, and an alternate ending inserted. Some of the direction was a bit bothersome. The art-film snobs think that this shows mastery of the craft, but I find it off-putting. I don\u0027t know why people raved about this film. It was OK, but worth watching mainly due to Bardot.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
