Al Lewis is clearly much older than he was when he was making The Munsters in the mid-60s. He did have a renaissance with this character in the mid-to-late \u002780s, so I suspect that\u0027s when it was really produced.\n\nAs far as his name goes, on The Munsters he was known as \"Grandpa\"; so I think changing it to \"Grampa\" got them around the copyright law. (Funny, though that his pet bat on the TV show was also named Igor; I suspect that you can\u0027t copyright a real name.) It\u0027s hard to say which is worse--the inane dialogue he\u0027s spouting or the trailers from the actual movies. But a job is a job, and you can tell that Al Lewis is a veteran pro, and he does a splendid job with what he has to work with. The movie trailers are ridiculous, which makes them enjoyable in their own way: we get to see how many different methods monsters of various persuasions used to destroy the earth a few decades ago." }
