It quickly transpires that the researcher was on the trail of immortality and what she knows could be worth a great deal of money in the right hands.\n\nAnimated using some of the best motion capture I\u0027ve ever seen this is a film of 98% stark black and white. Grey exists only in a window reflection and they\u0027re are two blips of color. Think Frank Miller\u0027s Sin City only harsher. The whites hurt the eyes especially when viewed on a really good TV. Its an intriguing experiment that will either thrill you or annoy the hell out of you. I\u0027m somewhere in the middle, finding I love the individual shots or sequences, but also being bothered by the effects of the color(less) choice on my eyes- things just look odd. What do I mean odd? weird shading of faces and places. There are also so some odd effects produced as people move in and out of light and dark. I know the frames would look okay but in motion its a bit strange (often brick walls).\n\nThe plot isn\u0027t all that great, its a bit circular for no real reason, with moment about an hour in where suddenly you know whats going on and how its all going to come out simply because its \"film noir lite\" with more than a tad predictability to character and situations. Granted if you haven\u0027t seen many film noirs you may not see the final twists coming so you may like it more than I did. (Also it didn\u0027t help that I saw the film of James Ellroy\u0027s Black Dahlia the night before. Ellroy was an inspiration to the filmmakers and its clear that they stole more than a riff or two from the master.) The movie as a whole isn\u0027t bad. Its a good but unremarkable thriller that has a plot that doesn\u0027t live up to its unique visual style. \n\nIt does have some incredible visuals of a Paris of the future not to mention a couple a marvelous action set pieces (the car/foot chase through the streets comes to mind) that would be the envy of any film animated or live action. Its worth seeing, just keep in mind that its visual promise is mot kept by its run of the mill story.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
