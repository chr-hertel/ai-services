The marriage arrangement based on an old promise seems like it might hold the solution to the greedy Gut\u0027s money problems, but when the prospective groom\u0027s financial situation doesn\u0027t live up to Gut\u0027s expectations she sends him packing after humiliating him and nearly giving her mother a stroke. The shunned groom then sets off to reclaim his lost honor with aid from a cursed hag, Jinx, even as Tung \u0026 Gut scheme to get back into their mother\u0027s good graces.\n\nMeanwhile, the father of the town beauty, Snow White (Rosamund Kwan), also seeks to marry her off. Unhappy with her prospects, she goes on the lam looking for excitement and is smitten by traveling magician Leslie Cheung. Snow White decides to trick her father into letting her marry the man of her choice. But complications arise when Tung decides he should be the one to make Snow White his bride.\n\nFilled with the usual anachronisms, a touch of gender-bender humor, mistaken identities, lots of silliness, singing and kung fu, it\u0027s yet another lunar New Year comedy. Still, with Sandra Ng, Rosamund Kwan and a tricky Leslie Cheung in the cast there are more than a few laughs to go around.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
