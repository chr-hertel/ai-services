When he\u0027s framed for murder, Dr. Thorndyke must confront his own psychiatric condition, \u0027high anxiety,\u0027 in order to clear his name. An homage to the films of Alfred Hitchcock; contains many parodies of famous Hitchcock scenes from THE BIRDS, PSYCHO, and VERTIGO.\"\n\nThis is a Mel Brooks movie which also stars Mel Brooks, but Cloris Leachman steals the show! As Nurse Diesel, Cloris Leachman dominates every scene in which she appears, as the lusty Dominatrix who has made Harvey Corman her love slave. That is the sub-plot, and it cranks into high speed about half way through the movie and shows a side of Cloris Leachman we KNEW was beneath those three-layered skirts worn by the Frau Blucher (Young Frankenstein).\n\nThis is wonderfully entertaining, and is perhaps one of the most horribly under-appreciated, and underrated of Brooks\u0027s wonderful spoofs. It is one of Brook\u0027s best, in my opinion, but I love Hitchcock, as well. If you\u0027re not a fan of Hitchcock\u0027s exponential style, you probably will not appreciate this, either, which probably is the heaviest contributing factor to this movie\u0027s under achievement. That is a real shame, as this is a highly entertaining venture.\n\nThat having been said, this work is great, if you\u0027re a Hitchcock fan. Otherwise mere Brooks fans may not be able to experience full appreciation of all the wonderful gags.\n\nIt rates an 8.4/10 from...\n\nthe Fiend :.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
