To absorb the complexity of the reams of information packed into such a \u0027short\u0027 space of time, as well as appreciate the art of the filmmaker, you need to see it at least half a dozen times. Oliver Stone mixes fact and fiction, real and imaginary events and characters, with such panache that it is sometimes very hard to distinguish between what is and is not true. But, at least, he stirred up some strong emotions in film goers, as well as reawakening people\u0027s interest in the assassination of John F Kennedy, which resulted in thousands of previously classified documents relating to that event being made public. And, to me, that can only be a good thing.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
