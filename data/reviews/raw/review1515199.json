Eagle Eye Cherry as the old lady\u0027s caretaker was awesome. The characters in Att göra en Pudel are sort of extreme but still authentic. A woman who dresses the the hair of dogs as the new age Cinderella is brilliant. Although it is hard to believe that a journalist who has bashed people for so long can really change into a compassionate and loving man, the message \"do good and good things will come back to you\" came across. I recommend this film to everyone who likes to watch romantic films with loads of humour. \"Att göra en Pudel\" is one of the best romantic comedies i have seen.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
