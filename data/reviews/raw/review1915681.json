If you don\u0027t know who Joss Whedon is, you need to get out more.\n\nThis short, internet film was made on a very limited budget-namely, Joss Whedon\u0027s own money-using friends and family to help him complete it. It was written and largely produced during the WGA strike. Why? Well, a man\u0027s gotta do, what a man\u0027s gotta do.\n\nThe vid is fun and funny, yes. It also has wonderfully appropriate, cleverly written songs. So, singing, jokes, and fun. Well, yes, and then again, Mr. Whedon can\u0027t leave anything as simply fun. It also contains tragedy combined with sufficient pathos and a touch of probing insight into the human condition. This qualifies \"Dr. Horrible\u0027s Sing-Along-Blog a bit more than a simple, goofball musical comedy exercise.\n\nOf course, it works just fine on that level, too. Be sure you watch it more than once.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
