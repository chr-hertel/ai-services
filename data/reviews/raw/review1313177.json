The careful housewife Edith (Naomi Watts) is married with the teacher and aspirant writer Hank Evans (Peter Krause) and they have a daughter. The two middle-class couples are best friends, visiting frequently each other. Edith feels neglected by Hank, and has a torrid affair with Jack. Terry loves Jack, but cheats him with Hank. And life goes on.\n\nI saw the trailer of this movie and I really expected a more conclusive story. I liked this provoking and complex film, mainly the intense interpretations of Mark Ruffalo and Laura Dern. The character of Naomi Watts is quite confused and even shallow, and the character of Peter Krause is very passive, almost a supportive character. The story shows infidelities, end of relationships, the preoccupation with the children before definitively ending the marriage and taking the step of a divorce, but something is missing to make \"We Don\u0027t Live Here Anymore\" an unforgettable movie. The motives for the adultery of Terry, who seems to be still in love with Jack, are not convincing. They have a crisis in their marriage, they do not talk any more, they have lots of fighting, but her affair with Hank is not well-explained. The motives for Jack are very clear, since he has a crush on Edith. The motives for Hank are also easy to be understood, since the guy is a cheater. But Edith seems to be a nymphomaniac, shagging with Jack everywhere, and totally dishonest with her best friend Terry. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Tentação\" (\"Temptation\")", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
