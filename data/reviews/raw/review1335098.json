However, I remained there, staring as if I was watching a car wreck on the side of the road.\n\nThere were some funny bits in this: The first human nest, for example. However, that wasn\u0027t about to carry the whole movie.\n\nThe cursing every third word wasn\u0027t necessary. The female lead was cute and actually played her role rather well. The sheriff\u0027s dry, almost bored, humor was realistic. Again, it wasn\u0027t enough to make up for the whole movie. At least she has the recurring role in the SpiderMan franchise.\n\nIf you must see one stinker for 2006, it might as well be this. The producers can be glad that Brokeback Mountain was released in 2005. That way Slither has no competition for the stinker award.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
