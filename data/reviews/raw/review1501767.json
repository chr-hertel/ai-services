The movie should be watched without constantly comparing it to the original with Michael Caine. Jude Law and the rest of the cast made an outstanding movie. I like the fact that it takes place in modern day Manhattan. The whole movie flows from the opening scene of Alfie\u0027s apartment to the end shot of him tossing flowers into the water. It is a remake and it is updated and it was done successfully so. The soundtrack is Fantastic! The photography of the movie mixed with Mick Jagger and Dave Stewart\u0027s genius soundtrack add up to a feast for the senses. I think this movie gets a bad rap, but I think it\u0027s great on its own. No apologies needed.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
