Before Davis co-stars with Leslie Howard in \"Of Human Bondage,\" she\u0027d been in over a score of movies. Legend has it that Davis was \u0027robbed\u0027 of a 1935 Oscar for her performance as a cockney-speaking waitress, unwed mother \u0026 manipulative boyfriend-user, Mildred Rogers. The story goes that the AFI consoled Davis by awarding her 1st Oscar for playing Joyce Heath in \"Dangerous.\" I imagine Davis\u0027 fans of \"Of Human Bondage\" who agree with the Oscar-robbing legend are going to have at my critique\u0027s contrast of the 1934 film for which the AFI didn\u0027t award her performance \u0026 the 1936 film \"Dangerous,\" performance for which she received her 1st Oscar in 1937.\n\nI\u0027ve tried to view all of Bette Davis\u0027 motion pictures, TV interviews, videos, advertisements for WWII \u0026 TV performances in popular series. In hindsight, it is easy to recognize why this film, \"Of Human Bondage,\" gave Davis the opportunity to be nominated for her performance. She was only 25yo when the film was completed \u0026 just about to reach Hollywood\u0027s red carpet. The public began to notice Bette Davis as a star because of her performance in \"Of Human Bondage.\" That is what makes it her legendary performance. But, RKO saw her greatness in \"The Man Who Played God,\" \u0026 borrowed her from Warners to play Rogers.\n\nI\u0027m going to go with the AFI, in hindsight, some 41 years after their astute decision to award Davis her 1st Best Actress Oscar for \"Dangerous,\" 2 years later. By doing so, the AFI may have been instrumental in bringing out the very best in one of Hollywood\u0027s most talented 20th century actors. Because, from \"Of Human Bondage,\" onward, Davis knew for certain that she had to reach deep inside of herself to find the performances that earned her the golden statue. Doubtless, she deserved more than 2 Oscars; perhaps as many as 6.\n\n\"Dangerous\" provides an exemplary contrast in Davis\u0027 depth of acting characterization. For, it\u0027s in \"Dangerous\" (1936) that she becomes the greatest actor of the 20th century. Davis is so good as Joyce Heath, she\u0027s dead-center on the red carpet. Whereas in \"Of Human Bondage,\" Davis is right off the edge, still on the sidewalk \u0026 ready to take off on the rest of her 60 year acting career.\n\nPerhaps by not awarding her that legendary Oscar in 1935, instead of a star being born, an actor was given incentive to reach beyond stardom into her soul for the gifted actor\u0027s greatest work.\n\nIt is well known that her contemporary peer adversary was Joan Crawford; a star whose performances still don\u0027t measure up to Davis\u0027. Even Anna Nicole Smith was a \u0027star\u0027. Howard Stern is a radio host \u0027star\u0027, too. Lots of people on stage \u0026 the silver screen are stars. Few became great actors. The key difference between them is something that Bette Davis could sense: the difference between the desire to do great acting or to become star-struck.\n\nTry comparing these two movies as I have, viewing one right after the other. Maybe you\u0027ll recognize what the AFI \u0026 I did. Davis was on the verge of becoming one of the greatest actors of the 20th century at 25yo \u0026 achieved her goal by the time she was 27. She spent her next 50 plus years setting the bar so high that it has not been reached . . . yet.\n\nHad the AFI sent her the message that she\u0027d arrived in \"Of Human Bondage,\" Davis\u0027 life history as a great actor may have been led into star-struck-dom, instead." }
