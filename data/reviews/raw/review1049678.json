Whilst the animation is sufficient to relay the story being told, i felt it didn\u0027t quite hit all the right spots. It contains all the usual characters now expected of animations; unsung hero, villain, comedian etc; but it doesn\u0027t quite have the same polish when compared to the more expensive productions of recent. I also felt some of the characters were a parody of a particular class of personnel associated with the British Airforce. My son really enjoyed it and also found it educational, once i had explained that mobile phones and computers weren\u0027t available in WWII and that the pigeons were actually used in the war. Go see it for yourself and decide, it\u0027s not a waste of money but it\u0027s also not Wallace \u0026 Gromit.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
