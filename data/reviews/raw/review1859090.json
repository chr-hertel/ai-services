Of course, I also enjoyed \"Ishtar.\" Could it possibly be that this couple will probably never get together? Lots of movie couples have a major obstacle that stands in the way of a genuine romance. But this is not an impossible situation here. And look at several mismatched TV couples (though on TV, we had years to anticipate the inevitable; here, just two hours minus commercials): Dave and Maddie on \"Moonlighting\", Joel and Maggie on \"Northern Exposure\", Lois and Clark in \"Lois and Clark\". In two of those three cases, we were actually better off without the couple being a \"couple.\" Here, I like the brother-sister dynamic with a hint of sexual tension.\n\nJennifer Lopez is a big reason why I liked this movie. Right from her first scene, her character is so nice, slightly flirty, and tough. Her standout scene is in a restaurant where several disagreeable young men are playing loud music. And toward the end of the movie, Lopez had me completely convinced that an unexpected plot twist came as a complete surprise. She appeared genuinely shocked (as if the script was changed without her being told), and her character seemed shaken up but still handled herself well.\n\nBut never mind her talent. Look at her! Great hair, great smile, great legs. And in her first scene she has on a low-cut top that shows off her tummy. But get ready--halfway through the movie J-Lo is doing yoga wearing almost nothing. And in the next scene she is in the shower, shown from the back from the waist up, at least on TV. Another incentive for straight guys to watch: one of the final scenes has dozen of babes in bikinis!\n\nI\u0027m not sure why I think of Ben Affleck as a respected actor. It\u0027s probably because of his association with Matt Damon, who has unquestioned talent. But Damon isn\u0027t here. And I\u0027ve also heard Affleck is considered a bad or mediocre actor. There\u0027s nothing here to support either position. He\u0027s not great, but not bad.\n\nJustin Bartha as Brian reminds me a lot of Dustin Hoffman in \"Rain Man.\" There\u0027s surely more dimension to Hoffman\u0027s Oscar-winning performance, but on the surface, Bartha appears to do a good job. In many of the scenes where he is wearing a colorful golf shirt (great shirt, by the way; where can I get one?) he lacks the ability to focus his eyes, which may be a symptom of his particular disability. On the other hand, his focus seems fine when he is wearing a t-shirt, and his ability to speak seems almost normal. I didn\u0027t even recognize him. There are a couple of scenes where his gibberish is completely unintelligible, but that may actually be accurate for this disability. A pretty good job overall; I found myself caring about this character.\n\nAl Pacino also does a good job as the evil boss. He\u0027s really worth seeing.\n\nAs for Louis: well, he\u0027s just plain mean. Lenny Venito is okay, but I certainly don\u0027t find myself rooting for him.\n\nIt\u0027s a nice little film if you get to see it edited for TV." }
