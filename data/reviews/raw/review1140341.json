I knew nothing about the Mcarthey era. I didn\u0027t live through the early post cold war paranoia. There were no outside influences aside from my love of movies. \n\nI have seen the film over 2 dozen times and believe it to be the best of the 50\u0027s generation, and one of the top 3 or 4 science fiction films of all time. With or without the prologue and epilogue.\n\nAll things are not what they seem. What if you woke up from a nightmare to find that you are still in it, and can\u0027t get out. The message is clear. A home, a car, and a career are all great to strive for in one\u0027s life. But love, compassion and emotion are the true gifts to keep living in the first place. Imagine a home without love or any emotion what so ever. None. Good or bad. \n\nOne by one, Kevin Mcarthy and Dana Wynter are confronted by the loss of neighbors, associates, and friends. The horror of the loss of everything they new. Early on, when a boy thinks his mother isn\u0027t his mother, and a friend doubt\u0027s her uncle is who he says he is. Doctor Miles is confused and doesn\u0027t know what to believe. So he goes with common sense. His eyes see there is no problem. But The evidence piles slowly and precisely. Soon it is not only what to believe, but who to trust.\n\nKevin Mcarthy is outstanding. Dana Wynter is absolutely gorgeous and the chemistry between the two seems real. The film will keep you glued from beginning \u0027til end. Simply one of the best!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
