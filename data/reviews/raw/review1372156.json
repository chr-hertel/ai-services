This was a movie I came across in my local video rental store while trying to find a horror movie a little more outside the mainstream.\n\n\"Bloodline\" is a story about Travis and his autistic brother, Henry, who take a camping trip with friends, only to have the trip end in a bloody massacre. While the twist of events that lead to this massacre are interestingly not disclosed until the end of the movie, the result is Henry running off to hide in the woods while Travis returns home with two other survivors, unaware of Henry\u0027s fate. As the movie unfolds, we follow both Travis and Henry as their lives move on beyond the tragic event, slowly learning new facts about what really led to the murders...and what really took place that night.\n\nDespite the low-budget of this movie, it is very well done, and has very professional look to it without the \u0027too glossy\u0027 Hollywood look. The charm is that it has an independent feel to it without coming across in any way cheap. It was clearly made by people who were fans of horror that really cared about what they were doing. The story was interesting and the acting, for the most part, was quite competent. I really enjoyed how expressive Henry (played by Bryan Smithson) was, despite the character\u0027s inability to speak. More interesting still, was the attention paid to the details. Specifically, I found the drawings and sketches that Henry had drawn to be very eye-catching and well-done. I paused the DVD a few times to get a better look at some of these drawings. \n\nWhile this movie may not be for everyone, it is certainly for viewers looking for a great independent horror film that doesn\u0027t have a straight-to-DVD look and feel. Don\u0027t let the DVD cover fool you (I found it a bit cheesy to be honest), this is definitely worth checking out if you\u0027re looking for something that doesn\u0027t stick to the typical horror \u0027formula\u0027.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
