My. Word.", "reviewBody": "To put it short, this episode is astounding. It\u0027s a classic tense horror story with a Doctor Who spin squeezed into 45 minutes. As far as scariness goes, Midnight ranks right up there with Blink and The Impossible Planet, but at the same time it\u0027s stunningly well written, brilliantly acted, and flawlessly produced.\n\nThe best thing about it is that it plays on everyone\u0027s fear of the unknown - there\u0027s SOMETHING knocking on the wall, but no-one\u0027s got any idea what, not even the Doctor. The tension starts about 10 minutes in and doesn\u0027t let up until 2 or 3 minutes from the end. While it might not have the flawless intricate detail of a Steven Moffat story, Midnight is so simple and so effective that it doesn\u0027t really matter, because it\u0027s so superb as it is that you\u0027re just transported to a world of fear where details don\u0027t matter.\n\nA special mention must go, of course, to Lesley Sharp, for a truly unbelievable performance. This episode wouldn\u0027t have been half as scary without her acting the way that she does - you\u0027ll understand why once you\u0027ve seen it. It\u0027s by far the best and the scariest \"human villain\" perfformance since Harry Lloyd in The Family of Blood last year.\n\nIt\u0027s episodes like this that make you a little sad that Russell T Davies is standing down, because this, along with Doomsday, is probably the best episode he\u0027s written. But at least he\u0027s being taken over by Steven Moffat. If the Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead double header hadn\u0027t been as good as it was, this would easily be the best episode of the series.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
