Initailly Creasy ( the Denzel character) is standoffish to the girl and tells her to shut up and let him do his job. But pretty soon he melts and becomes the kid\u0027s friend. That\u0027s the kind of corny schmaltz the movie could have done without. And the kid is so cute and sweet and innocent and that gets old real fast.\n\nAnyway, the kid gets kidnapped early in the movie and then Creasy springs into action and employs his formidable skills with guns and explosives to try and rescue the snot-nosed little darling . Lots of action and some really rough scenes as Creasy is more than willing to torture anyone with some information he wants.\n\nA very exciting and, in places, brutal show that would have been better without the kid from Disney. I have yet to see a movie improved by a 10 year old kid.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
