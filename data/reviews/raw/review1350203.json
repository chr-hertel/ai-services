The boy who plays the main \"hero\" is such a geeky wimp, it\u0027s an insult that this dweeb would have this power to stop the mighty Warlock!!! Like i said before, this film is a one man show, the scenes with Julian Sands are funny, entertaining and the way he kills off various people with lots of clever special effects makes it great fun to watch.\n\nBut overall i give this movie 5/10, coz all the other scenes were so dull.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
