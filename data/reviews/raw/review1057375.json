I fell in love with the character\u0027s \u0026 the story line, and at the end, I was in tears.\n\nThe movie is one of the greatest movie\u0027s that has not been publicised as much as any other. I was broken hearted like no other movie had made me feel. I love this movie dearly \u0026 i recommend it to ANYONE. I didn\u0027t think i would like it by the cover but don\u0027t let that deceive you.\n\nThis movie is excellent!.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
