The performances were great and i thought Elijah wood played his role very well too as he was casted in a good role for him. This film added another dimension to this genre for me because after watching The Football Factory, i was amazed, the film depicted the violence and made one understand the mindset of the individuals, this film in a more mainstream way achieved the same task, but even a bit better for me, although at times GSE is more exaggerating and far-fetched than The Football Factory, i thought it had some great themes, and issues dealt with which The Football Factory lacked. Both these films are successful in my eyes, very entertaining, well written and directed picture with great dialogues and characters. 10/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
