What many contemporary movie-makers seem to forget that high-school was an endearing time for almost everyone, and there are unique feelings that can be captured by a well-done, tasteful, artful film like Three o\u0027clock High.\n\nOne of the thing that sets this movie apart is its pacing. It is very deliberate and methodical, and it expertly builds the tension as the clock nears in on three o\u0027clock. Richard Tyson\u0027s performance is terrific; I don\u0027t recall any \"bully\" performances being anything like his. He is very menacing but introspective and intense. In a scene just before he fights another student, he is in the library reading a book. There are many subtle but illuminating bits like this throughout the movie.\n\nIn my nostalgic reviewing of 80s high school films, this is one of the few that seem even better now than they did then.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
