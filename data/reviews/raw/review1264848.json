The guy who plays \"Alex\" is pretty bad also. The way the production represents South Beach is cheesy, stereotyped, watered down crap. The sound design is also crap, as well as the directing. Its like watching a bunch of kids in an acting class and a film school throwing together a bad soap opera.\n\nThe only redeeming qualities about the show is that the music is O.K. and the actress who plays \"Ariel\" - Odette Yustman - is not only GORGEOUS and STUNNING, but also a decent actress (and it also helps her stand out that she\u0027s acting with possibly the WORST cast ever assembled for television).\n\nAnyway, that\u0027s my two cents - Don\u0027t watch the show - its CRAP!!!" }
