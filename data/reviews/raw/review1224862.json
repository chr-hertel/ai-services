I find it annoying that the screenwriter thought it was necessary to throw a few ethnic types into the mix of kids to give the storyline a contemporary twist. And why switch the number of children each parent had? In real life, it was the dad who had ten, the mom who had eight, and all of them were biologically theirs. Quaid and Russo are their usual likable selves, but can\u0027t salvage this unnecessary and egregiously unfunny slapstick version of life with the Beardsleys. If they were going to play fast and loose with the facts, they should have changed the names to protect the innocent and given the movie a new title, like \"His, Hers, and Theirs (But Who Cares?).\"", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
