Wasn\u0027t sure if I liked the Chris Tucker role on first viewing but now realise his comic element is a perfect balance for the sometimes serious subject. This movie has it all: comedy, sci-fi, suspense, thrills, adventure, drama, special effects and, most importantly, romance. The music was so good, (particularly \u0027The Diva\u0027) I bought the CD. A must see movie for anyone who doesn\u0027t take life too seriously-don\u0027t watch if you like \u0027believable\u0027 movies.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
