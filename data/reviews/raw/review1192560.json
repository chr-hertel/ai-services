Worth every penny!", "reviewBody": "For all the frustrations of this too-short film, Sir Georg Solti becomes our hero as we watch the progression of his great life. He is not too precious to include us. He is as fascinated by how things worked out for him as we are. As he warmly and poignantly narrates the drama of his struggles to develop and then his utter excitement and delight in his successes, we are allowed to share his joy. We are children having fun listening to our charming grandfather\u0027s stories about how he became Superman. Several times, others who comment on him admit to initial annoyance with Sir Georg which became affection and grew into love for he made us all better for having experienced him. --- It is a painful fact that this film is unfinished for more was planned when the grandfather maestro\u0027s heart stopped while he was vacationing in Antibes. Yet, someone so alive and so loved is always with us as are the composers he delivered to us in one great hall after another! Don\u0027t miss this DVD!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
