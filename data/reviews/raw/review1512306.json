In this picture there were only two professional actors hired to play certain key roles. This film has a very dark and deeply spiritual tale with antiques furnished in a very old French castle that was in ruined conditions and neglected, which made a perfect location. This is a very creepy slow moving film, but excellent for the year 1932.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
