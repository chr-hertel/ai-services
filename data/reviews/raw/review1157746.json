Have any of those nincompoops actually seen the movie?\n\nIt\u0027s certainly understandable if they hadn\u0027t, as it is EXTREMELY rare. More\u0027s the pity. This movie is a whoopee, stops-out, take-no-prisoners satire of absolutely everything: independent film-making, pop music, American mores, psychology, politics, family, education -- whatever popped into Downey\u0027s head. It\u0027s completely plot less and totally absurd, and it feels very much like a \"Monty Python\" episode made by New Yorkers in the \u002760\u0027s. \n\nIt\u0027s absolutely hilarious and I could go on for days about the performances too (why didn\u0027t Elsie Downey and Lawrence Wolf have huge careers beyond their films with Downey?), but let\u0027s just leave it at this: if you ever get the chance, SEE IT.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
