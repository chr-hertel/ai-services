Unfortunately it turned out to be a dull, boring, dumb pile of manure. Kelsey Grammar was just okay as Scrooge. All the other acting was awful. No one could get a proper English accent. I agree with one other person, Jason Alexander did remind me a lot of Danny DaVito as the penguin. And his musical number was simply ridiculous. They also really tweaked the original story to the point where it discoursed me. All the songs are simply bad. They are not memorable, and some were just down right boring. The ghost of Christmas past musical theater number dragged on and on and on and on and on and on and on to the point where I finally turned it off. I hope for everyone else\u0027s sake, that this doesn\u0027t come out on DVD.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
