Oh, to have been an adult in those days (\u002720s-\u002740s) when wit and education and intelligence were so prized! Parker, a unique talent who could write with pathos and humor, was surrounded by the likes of Robert Benchley, Edna Ferber, Charles Macarthur, Alexander Woolcott, Deems Taylor and Robert Sherwood. The sad thing is that if you\u0027re a young person and you happen to catch this film on the IFC channel, you won\u0027t have heard of any of these people. Nor will you be interested enough to look them up. People don\u0027t seem to have the intellectual curiosity they once did. I realize these are generalizations - just how general remains to be seen.\n\nThe atmosphere is set wonderfully in this film, which tells something of Dorothy Parker\u0027s sad life as she finds and loses love. Unfortunately, with possibly the exception of Campbell Scott as Benchley and at times Ms. Leigh, everyone is PLAYING Woolcott, MacArthur, etc. It\u0027s all a kind of let\u0027s pretend instead us showing us real people -- as famous as they all were, they were human beings. The script is uneven; the crazy, frenzied scenes at the Algonquin are the best ones, but we don\u0027t know these people well enough to be interested in smaller scenes.\n\nI had the great pleasure of seeing Jason Leigh on Broadway in \"Proof\" and she was excellent - she is a very fine actress with a broad range. But in her attempt to successfully have all of Dorothy Parker\u0027s externals, she\u0027s tripped herself up. I unfortunately only understood maybe 40% of what she was saying. Not only do I doubt that was true of the real Dorothy, I also doubt going that far with the voice was necessary - very, very few people who would see this film ever heard Dorothy Parker speak. It\u0027s a little like doing Eliza Doolittle - if you actually spoke pure Cockney, the audience wouldn\u0027t understand a word. Parker\u0027s droll tones channeled through Leigh\u0027s mouth don\u0027t work. She does, however, create a very real and very sad person who lived in an interesting time, wrote about it and who loved and drank her way through it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
