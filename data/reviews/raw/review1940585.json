A big jump from the third movie!", "reviewBody": "This movie is by far the best movie so far. After getting used to all the changes that were made in the 3rd movie, the fourth movie is a blast. The first thing I have to say is \"VOLDEMORT RULES!!!\" Whoever played Voldemort did an excellent job and you really learn to hate him (which is a good thing if you learn to hate the character and not the actor). The special effects rock and the acting is much better than I remember it being in the previous movies. I can\u0027t say much about the story because there\u0027s nothing new under the sun. As usual the director cut things, added things, and shortened things so as to make it not nearly as good as the books, but that\u0027s to be expected with all films that are based off of books. All in all this is a great movie that deserves to be bought off the shelf and watched over and over and over again.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
