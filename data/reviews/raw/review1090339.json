Call me naive, call me stupid, just don\u0027t call me ignorant when it comes to knowing a good action film when I see it. Forget about history, if I wanted a historical documentary, I would have watched one. This movie is about action, explosions, and submarine warfare. And I got plenty of it. I\u0027m bothered at how many reviews bash this film for it\u0027s historical inaccuracy. I really didn\u0027t care. If your looking for action, adventure, and GREAT surround sound, watch this film. There are LOTS of films that don\u0027t depict history accurately, that are great films. You don\u0027t see five hundred bad reviews for Braveheart because thats not historically accurate. I have yet to read a review about Saving Private Ryan that argues the fact that there was no Private Ryan to actually save. And I\u0027m pretty sure nobody ever complained that The Perfect Storm couldn\u0027t possibly be accurate, considering the entire crew died. This movie is good, no matter how you look at it. Enjoy it for what it\u0027s worth, and then go to you local library and learn all about U boats. Watch this movie with the volume LOUD, turn your sub UP, and watch the windows rattle at the depth charges. This movie will blow you out of your seat!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
