Not having seen it, and not having other choice, we decided to take a look, and quite frankly, it was a surprise. The film, directed by Melvin Frank and co-written with his partner, Norman Panama, shows two stars that endeared themselves to the American public at their best.\n\nThe story is just a pretext and a vehicle for the stars. The plot kept reminding us of \"A Guide for the Married Man\", but that\u0027s all the comparison, because one has nothing to do with the other. In fact, this is a film made in 1960 when nothing too risky would be tackled for the screen, yet, it presents two straying adults who suddenly find an attraction where dislike existed before.\n\nBob Hope was the surprise in the movie. He doesn\u0027t have a chance for uttering his one liners, as the script doesn\u0027t allow it. It was one of the best films in which he appeared, in our humble opinion. Lucille Ball was an excellent comedienne, and she shows it on this film.\n\nThe interesting supporting cast makes the best with the material they were given to play. The excellent Ruth Hussey is seen as Bob Hope\u0027s wife. Don DeFore, plays Lucille\u0027s husband. Louis Nye is also seen in the film.\n\nThe film is light and will charm anyone wanting to spend some time in the company of some of America\u0027s best comic talent of the past.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
