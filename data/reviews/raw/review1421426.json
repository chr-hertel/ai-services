Like most people I do not like to know the plot or, especially, the ending but I think most people coming into the movie without any prior knowledge would have a basic idea what the story is about and it seemed as if it would be the basic comic book story. Now don\u0027t get me wrong, I do like comic books especially the graphic novels but, like \"Sin City\", most target an audience which crave sex and violence. Despite the hype, \"Sin City\" was pretty poor and it seems as if this movie would be more of the same. But looks can be deceptive. There is sex and violence but what raises this movie above the ordinary is the story and the acting. Like all good movies it gets you thinking but without spoiling the plot by getting into to much detail there is a cause and effect for all the actions. The casting of the movie was also interesting. Viggo Mortensen is a very under-rated actor and this movie shows that he can still play \"Lord of the Rings\" but also superb characters like La-Ling out of \"Carleto\u0027s Way\". The movie also showcases the talents of Bello, Hurt and, especially, the superb McHattie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
