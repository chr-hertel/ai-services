Both are good flicks to watch, not the same old tripe, cranked off the assembly line. For the most part this picture (November) keeps you in the dark all the way to the end as to what\u0027s going on, it was to jerky. For example, I was not sure if the dinner scenes with mom were different days, or the same scene repeated in different ways. This leaves the viewer confused. And this happens over and over with most of the scenes in the movie. As I said before you should give The Machinist a look and see if I\u0027m not right on this, editing can make or break a picture.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
