Marquand\u0027s 1951 novel \"Melville Goodwin: USA.\" The book was about an Army general\u0027s affair with a prominent woman, and it was one of Marquand\u0027s most entertaining. Unfortunately, the movie retains almost nothing of the original story except for the names of the two romantic leads. In the book, the general is already married, and making him a bachelor in the movie simply changes everything. The movie even eliminates the narrator of the book, who supplied much of its humor. Readers of the book can watch the movie with no sense of what will happen next. The two are that different, and the movie is undeniably inferior." }
