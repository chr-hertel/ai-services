Although I think its down-tempo and simple story line are a little of a let down, the rest of the film is pure magic.\n\nThe movie is based on a great illusionist who re-encounters his childhood-friend/girlfriend. After that you know what... he tries to run away with her even though she\u0027s engaged to the Crown Prince. So don\u0027t expect complex and mind blowing intrigues.\n\nWhat I believe to be the appealing part of the movie was the plot around the boy chases girl thing. The great magic tricks along with a solid structure are what the film is all about. After all, a credible scenario along with intelligent and creative ideas are enough reasons to make it a good movie.\n\nHaving Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti amongst the cast is just a proof that the acting is top notch. You can\u0027t even complain about Jessica Biel as far as I\u0027m concerned.\n\nThe soundtrack sets the ambiance just right, so thumbs up for the whole environmental aspects of the movie.\n\nBasically a great film, although I recommend it when you\u0027re in a mood for a non-existent-action mystery/romance flick.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
