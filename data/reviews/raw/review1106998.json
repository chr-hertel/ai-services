How they went about creating the CGI of the mummy and interviews with some of the cast and crew are what this featurette is about. It goes on for a tad too long and the title is kind of misleading as they didn\u0027t build a BETTER mummy, just a different one, but I digress. The one thing everyone will be able to agree on is that John Berton, Jr. guy is one weird looking dude. This almost 50 minute long documentary can be found on disc one of the 2-disc Ultimate edition DVD of 1999\u0027s \"the Mummy\" remake.\n\nMy Grade: C-", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
