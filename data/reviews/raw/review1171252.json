The Phantom is eccentric and crazy but he is a talented musician that ends up tutoring a young soprano chorus girl, who he falls in love with over time. The love however drives the Phantom into further madness and despair when he realizes his love\u0027s heart belongs to someone else.\n\nOne of the great things the film has to offer is the beautiful and eye-catching visuals, which are truly amazing. Although, the lavish scenery might be too stunning for it\u0027s own good since it can become quite distracting. While, you\u0027re admiring the elaborate costumes, set-design and cinematography you might miss some important aspects of the film and story. Other things to admire are the exceptional performances especially from Emmy Rossum (plays Christine) the revelation of the year and Gerard Butler (plays Phantom). Emmy exudes such beauty and innocence; that you can\u0027t resist liking her. I was also surprised by her astonishing vocals, she actually sings better than many of today\u0027s musicians. Gerard Butler\u0027s voice was also a surprise since I heard so many people say his atrocious singing had ruined the film. Now his voice wasn\u0027t spectacular, but it worked, it was rough, powerful and passionate. You can tell he tried his best since he put a lot of emotion into his singing; he was able to convince us of his great love and obsession for Christine and might I add that he looked great as the Phantom, I really can\u0027t imagine anyone else for the role after viewing the film. Also, the last 50 minutes of the film were quite good since it became fast paced, entertaining and more action filled. The final piece of the film I enjoyed were three songs in particular. I really liked \"The Phantom of the Opera\" especially it\u0027s haunting melody and I also enjoyed the sweet and sorrowful, \"Think of Me\" and \"Angel of Music\".\n\nUnfortunately, I hated quite a few things about the film. I wasn\u0027t particularly fond of most of the music and songs. It was missing catchy and fun music like \"Moulin Rouge!\" and the entertaining upbeat songs from \"Chicago\". I also thought the lack of spoken dialogue throughout the film dragged it and it became annoying at some points listening to song after song without any breaks for long periods of time. I would have liked a nice balance of singing and spoken dialogue much like \"West Side Story\", \"Chicago\" and \"Moulin Rouge!\" managed to work with. The last thing I despised was Minnie Driver\u0027s (plays Carlotta) performance. It was extremely annoying and I understand her character is supposed to be annoying, but I felt like she went overboard. Seriously, every time she opened her mouth I wanted someone to slap her. But it doesn\u0027t stop there she also had an atrocious strong accent, which at times made it difficult to understand what she was saying, and don\u0027t even get me started on her vocal performance. Minnie singing voice was dubbed, but the person who provided her vocals was excruciating to listen to. I didn\u0027t think it was good, but it wasn\u0027t a bad film either. I could see myself watching it again if I had nothing better to do or watch on TV." }
