However, it\u0027s the comedy that makes the difference. In \u0027Fargo\u0027 the humour is more subtle and disguised as drama while in \u0027The Big White\u0027 the dialogues and situations are more obviously funny and that\u0027s what gives it its own charm. Another difference is that \u0027Fargo\u0027 is a black comedy while this one is more of a dark comedy that\u0027s not exactly black. Mark Mylod directs a splendid ensemble cast and tells the story at an initially slow but eventually steady pace. The actors are great. Robin Williams as the down-on-his-luck travel agent trying to make some quick bucks is wonderful. Holly Hunter is hilarious as the wife suffering from fake Tourettes syndrome (more likely a form of Munchausen\u0027s syndrome). She brilliantly balances humour and pathos. Both she and Williams share a good chemistry as do Giovanni Ribisi and Allison Lohman. Ribisi naturally fits the part while Lohman has a small role but makes the best of what she has and shines. Tim Blake Nelson and Earl Brown are quite funny too and Woody Harrelson, though initially loud, manages to give a more controlled performance in the latter reel. It\u0027s a dark comedy, so the humour is obviously dark but this is a fun film and I really liked it. The songs are very nice too especially \u0027I Want To Protect You\u0027 by Mark Everett. The cinematography is marvelous in the beginning but slowly settles for OK as the story moves towards the end. It\u0027s a pity that the film didn\u0027t even get a proper theatrical release and remains underrated and unseen by many. I\u0027m glad I caught it and it\u0027s definitely worth watching for those who like dark comedy. What\u0027s not to like? There\u0027s violence, romance, suspense, humour and it\u0027s a clever story." }
