I was waiting for this movie, everybody knows the book it\u0027s already a classic, Trujillo\u0027s era it\u0027s one of the bloodiest of all the dictators-ships that Latin America has suffer. Well, this movie is based on the book of the same name, but it\u0027s very difficult to top the book\u0027s magic in a two hours film. It\u0027s not a bad movie, but it\u0027s not what should have been. Nice cinematography in some scenes but the director fails in portray to us the strongest side of the characters. I give the movie a 6 out of 10, cause anyways, it\u0027s a good approach to the book, and the people that doesn\u0027t know about this story, i recommend this movie as the best out there about Trujillo and his \"nasty\" regime.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
