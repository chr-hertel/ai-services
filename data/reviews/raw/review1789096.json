There are films in which it has been done well; The Haunted Palace, for example, and then there are films in which it is not done well...this film for example. Superstition takes this horror clich√© and, aside from a few amusing death scenes, doesn\u0027t add anything to it; which makes watching it pretty pointless. The plot revolves around an old house. A new family moves in, blah blah, and then people start getting killed, blah blah and eventually we find out that it\u0027s because of a witch that was put to death centuries earlier. As mentioned, this film does feature some good death scenes and they are rather gory; the best one sees a circular saw break free and rip through a man\u0027s chest, and a strangulation in an elevator shaft takes second place. It\u0027s obvious that nobody wanted to give the filmmakers much money (wonder why...) however, as the entire film looks very cheap and this does affect the credibility of the death scenes also. Overall, this is pretty much a big waste of time; there are better films about witches coming back for revenge, so see those instead!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
