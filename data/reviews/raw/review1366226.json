However, the most enduring aspect of this film is the thought process it invokes. On it\u0027s surface, it seems to be a simple \"boo big government!\" film. However, you dig a little deeper, and you see that it\u0027s a warning piece that, though the source material could not have anticipated it, speaks out quite neatly against things like the Patriot Act; things that rob us of liberty for the sake of security, leaving us deserving neither (paraphrasing Ben Franklin there -- it\u0027s an old idea). And then, on yet another level, it is a film about the revolutionary spirit, differing perspectives on \"terrorism,\" etc....essentially, highlighting as many shades of gray as can be found in such an issue. To summarize the summary, if you like your films full of intellectual exposition and aren\u0027t too worried about \"genrefication,\" this is right up your alley. If you want nothing but explosions and gun/knife play, stay the ever-loving hell away.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
