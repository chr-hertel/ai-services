An unbelievable plot, characters that seem to have stepped out of a sit-com, and below \"TV movie\" quality production. Is it my imagination or are most films getting dumber and dumber, I guess Hollywood (or is it Toronto now?) is going for a 10 year old male demographic, or severely retarded adults. But it does have it\u0027s laughs (all unintentional). There\u0027s a great scene where Rachel\u0027s girl in peril character gets head- butted by Cilian\u0027s psycho character, and she passes out for a few minutes (funny stuff) and another where they fight, kick and wrestle in the plane\u0027s restroom. I guess if I could say one thing positive about \"Red Eye\" it would be that Rachel McAdams (\"Mean Girls\",\"Wedding Crashers\") is a total fox.... but she can\u0027t act! Cilian Murphy (who fought off zombies in \"28 Days Later\") gets to play one in this.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
