In fact, I was stunned by the animation style that I immediately checked around the internet to try to determine HOW they did this film. One claimed they were puppets with real sets but I couldn\u0027t get much more about it--and I really hope they release a film showing how they made it. The film is so unique, so beautiful and such an artistic triumph that you really cannot appreciate the look of the film until you see it for yourself. In light of this, I am not at all surprised that it\u0027s been nominated for an Academy Award--we\u0027ll just have to wait and see if it wins.\n\nAs for the story, it\u0027s best described as confusing and practically insignificant. It\u0027s as if the film is an artist\u0027s pallet and you watch and absorb the film--meaning and significance are really up to the beholder. Other than it\u0027s obvious Madame Tutli-Pulti has gotten on a very strange and surrealistic train, I really am not sure what it was all about and that, for once, is okay with me. You just have to see it to believe it.\n\nUPDATE---This is the day before the Oscars are announced for 2008 and I just got back from a special screening by our local film society of all five films nominated in the category of Best Animated Short Film. This film was among the five and I was surprised that my reaction to the film differed, somewhat, the second time. First, on a big screen, Madame and the other characters were significantly uglier and creepier, though the sets and effects were still amazing. Second, the story was still weird and incomprehensible! I predict that although this film is very different and likable, it probably won\u0027t win the Oscar as \"MÃªme les pigeons vont au paradis\" and \"Moya lyubov\" were among the nominees and seemed like better films.\n\nANOTHER UPDATE--2/24/08--The Oscar was just announced and the winner in this category was PETER \u0026 THE WOLF.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
