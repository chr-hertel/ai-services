Only for people who love hurting them selves or like feeling stupid. Watching this God awful show will make you wish TV was never invented so crap like this show never came into being. For those that do like this show, ask yourselves \"Why am I watching this?\" There is plenty of compelling quality TV on right now for your viewing pleasure. Watch Buffy or Angel or even Gilmore Girls. Shows that have thoughtful dialog and are actually story driven. Charmed only gets by because it has three hot women who unfortunately do not know how to act. The shows one saving grace was Cole and he vanished after season 4.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
