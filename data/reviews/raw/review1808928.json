I went to toystorymovies.com and it said that the third installment will be coming after the first two are \"re-mastered\". I wonder what it will be about since they left off of the second one but I have always felt disappointed that they never made a follow up to it and it looks like it finally will happen. I hope they continue logically because since Pixar has been taken over by Disney they might make it more Disney-er. Either way I am just glad that they are going to finish it up. Cant wait!" }
