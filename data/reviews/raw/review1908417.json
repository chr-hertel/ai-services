Rove without a doubt is America\u0027s smartest and most well informed political adviser for the way he knows history and demographics as this film tells of his start in Utah as a young man then away to college. Also it tells how he joined young republicans which would lead to his meeting with the Bush family and it was from that moment on he had his plans for a W. presidency! From reports of his clever times of bugging his own office during a Texas governors race to his alleged phone calls of dirty tricks against John Mccain in the South Carolina primary of 2000 in which helped propel George W. Bush to the top. Hey they always said politics is dirty laundry and strange bedfellows and with this master mind Karl Rove is living proof of it. Good documentary that\u0027s informative and educational.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
