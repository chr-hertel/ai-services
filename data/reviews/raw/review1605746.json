I was so looking forward to this. A nice cast, an intriguing premise and a director with something to prove. All the ingredients, but in the end we have no cake.\n\nFascinating facts and creepy images and coincidences involving the number 23 are just skimmed over. Instead we are given what feels like 80% set-up and 20% explanation. What\u0027s missing? The guts of the story, that\u0027s what! The set-up drags on so long it actually becomes boring. There is so little suspense and so few thrills and so little drama, I am not even sure what to label the film ... other than disappointing.\n\nI usually enjoy Jim Carrey in his serious roles, you know ... \"The Truman Show\" and \"The Majestic\". However, in this film he doesn\u0027t even seem like a real guy. Plus I couldn\u0027t help but think of \"Ace Ventura\" when we first realize he works for animal control. This film is just too dark and bland to allow his charisma to come through. Virginia Madsen is stuck in another thankless role. Can\u0027t someone please cast this charming, talented lady in a real movie? Support work by Danny Huston, Ed Lauter, Rhona Mitra (ex-\"Boston Legal) and don\u0027t miss Bob Zmuda in a brief role. Zmuda is Andy Kaufman\u0027s former sidekick.\n\nReally don\u0027t have much good to say about the execution of this one. Had high hopes and just feel let down. Not unusual for a Joel Schumacher film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
