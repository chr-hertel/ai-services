For this review, I\u0027d like to say that the cut, while not complete, does satisfy. It shows, as best as it can, what Donner\u0027s film would have been like.\n\nMost notably, the tone of the film more closely matches the first film. With comic book films, there is always a tendency to admit the joke and try to have fun with it... at the expense of the story, but Superman: The Movie\u0027s success rested on it\u0027s ability to bring in humor without camp and always take the material seriously.\n\nThe restoration of Marlon Brando\u0027s scenes is worth a viewing. There are also a number of scenes that have been restored which makes the film seem \"new\" even though you may have seen it many times before. The best addition is the overall feel of the film which has been changed back to the more \"serious\" feel of part one.\n\nWorth the money. You may kneel before Zod once again... for the first time.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
