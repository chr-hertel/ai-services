Ann Hui\u0027s finest of films", "reviewBody": "This is one of my favorite films, I\u0027ve seen it five times. A beautiful film by Ann Hui about a Cantonese girl Hueyin (Maggie Cheung) trying to be friends with her Japanese mother. Hueyin goes to Japan with her mother and there they get to know their differences and eventually understand each other. I think they understood each other the most when her mother talked of the Sino-Japanese war to Hueyin and how she and her father met. To me that was the one of the most well-acted scenes in the film. The music went well with each sad and reminiscent scene in the film, which I guess was mostly what added the drama to it. I hope Ann Hui makes more good films like this one.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
