While I admit the movie didn\u0027t bore me, I wasn\u0027t exactly entertained, which I should have been considering it was an action movie. The gun fights were high on pyrotechnics, but didn\u0027t make me feel like I was there. They didn\u0027t engross me the way the battle towards the end of MI2 did. The biggest problem with this movie was the underdeveloped plot. The love story felt underdeveloped and as a result I never felt like Cruise had a real reason to be fighting. This fault is worsened by the fact that the \"dooms day weapon\" was never really presented as such, this could have added a needed motivation.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
