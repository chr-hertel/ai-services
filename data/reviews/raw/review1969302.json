This was during the tenure of Lorraine Heggessey, who\u0027s other dubious decisions included recruiting Graham Norton to the BBC.\n\nThe good news is that the CDs of the Radio 4 broadcasts make great listening and perhaps even benefit from better comic timing than the TV series managed. The radio series retains the same cast as the television production.\n\nI also seriously recommend Andy Hamilton\u0027s other Radio 4 series, Old Harry\u0027s Game, also available on CD and well worth owning. The man is a comic genius.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
