In fact personally I would be embarrassed to have my name attached to this film. \n\nI won\u0027t go into detail because there is entirely no point.It\u0027s not even bad enough or tongue and cheek enough to be good.\n\nI\u0027m all for independent films and there are often some real gems, many of which are amongst my all time favourites which and easily outclass big budget movies. I\u0027m thinking of classics such as Pi, Primer, Man Bites Dog, Das Experiment, and The Magician, to name but a few. But sadly it is not the case here. This director is going to have to seriously up his game if he wants a career.\n\nComplete cringe-worthy clich√©d pooh from beginning to end.\n\nDon\u0027t waste your time.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
