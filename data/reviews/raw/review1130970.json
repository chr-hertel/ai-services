Much better. For a movie so dependent on special effects, there seemed to be absolutely no attempt to merge the actual footage with the special effects, seamlessly. I was so unable to suspend my disbelief for this film, that I spent the entire movie waiting for it to end. I\u0027ll admit, I liked the mermaids (although I was very annoyed by the very red hair. I understand that it\u0027s fantasy, but there is absolutely no excuse for that hair!), and Jason Isaacs played both of his parts well (although, in most productions I\u0027ve seen where Mr. Darling and Hook are played by the same actor, the director has enough sense to capitalize on this. Here, it just seems like a money-saver), as well as most of the adult actors. The children in the film were totally miscast, in my opinion. I felt that none of the actors were cut out for their roles, and, cute as he may be, Jeremy Sumpter just didn\u0027t pass as Peter Pan. While I can understand those who don\u0027t agree with me, anybody who expects a film to include good direction, acting, and editing will be disappointed (I would suggest the silent movie version, which I think was far superior to this one). But if you don\u0027t care, help yourself to this film.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
