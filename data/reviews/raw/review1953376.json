The bio has her being born in 1903. This episode from 1959 has her at about twenty!! Obviously a different person.\n\nI have written IMDb but have been ignored.\n\nThis episode, and Waco Williams are my all time favorite Mavericks. \"You sure he can count all the way to ten, Colonel?\"\n\nWonderful ENCORE TV is now showing all the Mavericks in order, every day at 6PM. DON\"T MISS A ONE!\n\nNow all we have to do is wait for them to come out on DVD.\n\nPlys all the other Warner Bros TV shows from the fifties.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
