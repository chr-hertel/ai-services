When he hears Andy mentioning trying to buy his girlfriend a fur coat for that amount since that\u0027s all he has, the Kingfish offers to take that money in exchange for Andy\u0027s going in the chinchilla business of making one from them. Then he gets Algonquin to get a couple of rabbits to pass off to Andy as chinchillas...This being the final episode of \"Amos \u0027n\u0027 Andy\", it\u0027s a shame the controversy over the character portrayals have carried to this day since compared to today\u0027s depiction of pimps and other street thugs, the characters here are less offensive in comparison. Anyway, this wasn\u0027t as funny as previous episodes I\u0027ve just seen the day before but it\u0027s amusing enough. Nice final look at a show created on radio by writers/actors Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll nearly 23 years before.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
