Obstacles such as: communication breakdowns, computer malfunctions, broken circuit board to launch the Lunar Lander off the moon (fixed by a ball point pen), low fuel, and perhaps the most incredible revelation was Buzz Aldrin talking about their craft being trailed by a UFO.\n\nThe program contains some wonderful color footage of the Apollo program, gripping first-person accounts from Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, Mission Control Flight Director Gene Kranz, as well as others instrumental to the successful Apollo 11 mission. To underscore the real risks and dangers facing the astronauts who were using a Lunar Lander (whose engine was only fully operational 50% of the time during previous space tests) the documentary illuminates the draft of President Nixon\u0027s memorial speech should the Astronauts be unable to leave the moon\u0027s surface.\n\nAnyone interested in the history of America\u0027s space program or who revels in humanity\u0027s ingenuity and spirit to triumph in the face of seeming insurmountable obstacles should enjoy this feature.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
