The premise amusing: A hard-boiled editor faces off with a journalism teacher.\n\nThe gender politics haven\u0027t aged well: Today, the Doris Day character would surely be an editor herself. In those days, though, being a nurse or teacher were what bright women did. And Day is a professor here (albeit in a night school.) She and Clark Gable, playing the newsman, don\u0027t exactly have chemistry. But they\u0027re not supposed to like or trust each other at first. They are both major movie stars in a system that was dying out.\n\nSpeaking of dying, this was near the end of Gable\u0027s career -- only a few films before more famously ill-fated \"The Misfits.\" And two of the major supporting players were to die at their own hands: Gig Young plays a brilliant psychologist Gable sees as a rival for Day\u0027s affections. (The scenes in which he\u0027s drunk are where it began, for me, to lose its charms a bit. They\u0027re slightly mean.)\n\nNick Adams, too, died of unnatural causes. He plays a promising up-and-comer at the paper.\n\nDay is stuck with a very unbecoming hairstyle. It sort of bridges the gap between her days singing with big bands and her greatest (popular, if not critical) glory days in the movies with Rock Hudson. She gives a sturdy, likable performance.\n\nMamie Van Doren is a nightclub singer of Gable\u0027s acquaintance. She too has a terrible haircut. (Please note: I generally don\u0027t notice actresses\u0027 hair but these two are notably unflattering.) The nightclub scenes recall \"The Awdul Truth.\" And if, as she sings, she invented rock and roll, the song she sings in the club certainly shows no sign of that.\n\nThe movie is long for a comedy. It could have been shorter and could have been better. Still, it\u0027s pure pleasure most of the way through.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
