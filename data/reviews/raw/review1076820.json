Everybody was happy there living off the fat of the land. Then one day a power company announced it was going to string a million-volt powerline over the top of it. The people didn\u0027t like the idea. But this is a modern industrialized society and powerlines are considered necessary, and the power company and the government wouldn\u0027t stop the powerline construction. The people sabotaged the construction. Somebody came up with a brilliant idea: they could construct a powerline tower over the Governor\u0027s house! Surely he would see things from their point of view then! Oh, will they construct it without getting caught? Oh, would the Governor indeed stop the powerline construction? Watch and find out, if you can ever find this movie. This movie captures the spirit of the 1970s Midwest at the county level. It was filmed in Ohio, but at about the same time, there was a similar situation near Lowry, Minnesota.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
