I have liked liked X-Men and similar movies, as I take them strictly as entertainment. I even enjoyed DareDevil!\n\nBut this Elektra movie was total disaster in every respect.\n\nThe movie really ends about 15 minutes before it is over, but they keep stretching to make it last about 1-1/2 hour long.\n\nIt probably would be OK as a Saturday morning 1-hour cartoon - for under three-year old\u0027s, that is.\n\nSave your money, and don\u0027t even bother with the DVD.\n\nI am forced to add more lines to my critique, but the movie doesn\u0027t even deserve the 10 lines that are required." }
