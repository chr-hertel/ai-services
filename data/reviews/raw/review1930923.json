The cinematography, script, plot, and characterizations are all done beautifully. This is not your half-comedic run-of-the-mill John Carpenter vampire flick. It\u0027s quite intense at times and not a movie you\u0027d want to watch alone on a dark night. The vampire portrayals are quite gruesome -- especially the leader (Marlowe?) and his girlfriend (Iris?). (She\u0027s the stunning vamp chick with the long nose.) Whoever did the make-up work for this movie deserved an award because it was absolutely brilliant. I highly recommend this movie if you like \"realistic\" no-nonsense vampire movies.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
