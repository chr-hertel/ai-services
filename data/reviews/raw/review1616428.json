I was skeptical at first. But I kept on reading about Reeker and seeing it pop up on top 10 favorite lists. Let\u0027s start by saying that the desert is an awesome horror setting. The killer or \"monster\" (the Reeker) -I won\u0027t give it away - but he is more than a super scary dude with a variety of nasty weapons. His appearing is anticipated by the sense of a putrid smell-sounds silly, but trust me, somehow it works and it makes this is such a fun movie!!! The characters are all interesting-unlike most shallow horror film stereotypes. (There\u0027s a guy who has an obsession, with finding the \"perfect song\" for every situation-which I thought was v.funny.) The acting is really good, especially Arielle Kebbel (Grudge 2, playing a hot BLONDE here), as a girl whose parents let her choose her own name (Cookie). The guy from the American \"Ugly Betty\", Eric Mabius, plays a threatening weirdo who turns out to be one of the heroes.\n\nReeker reminded me of slasher movies of the 80\u0027s. This movie DID NOT STINK!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
