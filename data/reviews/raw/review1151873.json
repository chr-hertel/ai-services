It contains stories of different people who all have to do with this theme. Some of them are the hunters, some the prey. Further in the movie the story lines get mixed up and every character comes to a point which changes his life. The movie shows in an amazing way how people get along with racism and how it can change their lives. Some of the destiny\u0027s are showing a happy end, some not. In the end you will get out of the cinema and just can\u0027t decide if you should be happy or sad. The film shows both sides of the medal and so it will become an experience you won\u0027t forget so fast.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
