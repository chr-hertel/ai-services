Sure, the whole dysfunctional family thing is incredibly similar to The Simpsons, and they ripped off quite a few jokes, but the style of comedy is generally different. Family Guy uses flashbacks and side-references, generally to effect.\n\nAnd yes, Family Guy can be stupid- but it\u0027s funny, isn\u0027t it?\n\nMy favorite characters are without a doubt the diabolical Stewie and Peter (although the talking family dog comes close).\n\nA very funny show that doesn\u0027t deserve to be labeled as a pale imitation of The Simpsons as it has. Check it out." }
