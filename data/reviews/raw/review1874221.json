This movie is what sells and what is good about our country, $10 at the theater and a costumed hero on a McDonald\u0027s super size cup. just like your imagination for buying into this is the equivalent of fast food. The yellow pictures being the established character and actors. Like having Robert Downey Jr. who\u0027s life would at least like to be a polar opposite in standards. I like him but please we cannot forget. So I find that amusing, along with the peppered script of good goody, gee gollies dialog. every one in the movie is a parody of the character, even Jeff Bridges whom I\u0027m sure only did this one to play a bad guy. half way threw the plot.\n\nRemember Fire engine red is the go sign for profit, when it only turns your minds on fire.\n\nSo now...\n\n\"damn...
