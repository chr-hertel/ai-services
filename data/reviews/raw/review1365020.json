I saw it Summer 2005 at the Gloria Film Festival where it won the audience favorite award. I would love to see it again but it looks like they don\u0027t have a distributor yet. Please release this movie in theaters!!!!!!! I would pay to see it again and I\u0027d get my friends to go and they\u0027d get their friends to go and their friends.... Not to mention DVD sales. It\u0027s a keeper, if only I could get it.\n\nThe real-life testimonials in the movie were awesome. The storyline is funny. The actors do a great job.\n\nSee it if you get the chance. It\u0027s worth it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
