I first saw this film about ten years ago and I have to admit that I was shocked. I wasn\u0027t shocked by the gore necessarily but by the storyline. It\u0027s a very brutal and pointless excavation but it works as a great story of revenge. Basically, three people go into the amazon jungle to prove that cannibalism does not exist. While in the jungle they run into two drug dealers. One of which had tortured and murdered a tribe member. Well, this leads into him murdering another member of the tribe later on. At this point, the tribe has had it and decide to seek revenge on not just the man that murdered some of the tribe but also to slaughter the others that had nothing to do with killing any of the tribe. Lenzi must have gone all out with the budget because I have seen most of his movies and I must say the rest are laughable compared to this shocker. Although, this is a great cannibal film but the only problem with the movie just like most of the big cannibal films is for some reason they have to have moments of real animal cruelty. I will never understand this. Sure there is shock value in this but it\u0027s undesired shock that will make most people walk away from these movies. But all in all, this is a very good film (not as good as Cannibal Holocaust) and if you\u0027re into this genre of films I hope this review will help out. 8 stars", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
