BOYS OF BARAKA is not just great, it\u0027s one of the most important documentaries I\u0027ve ever seen about American life -- and life in general. Even the comparable HOOP DREAMS seems rather slight compared to this great film. I hope the filmmakers make a follow-up film about 3, 5 or 10 years from now. And I hope some of these kids get to go back to Baraka, either as students, visitors or teachers.\n\nSince I need 10 total lines to make a review, I\u0027ll just say:\n\nGo \n\nSee\n\nThis\n\nFilm!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
