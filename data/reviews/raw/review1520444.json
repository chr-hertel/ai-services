That is such a ridiculous statement considering Rick is a Grammy award winner and i\u0027m sure has had more top 20 singles than the poster has! So, what I would like to comment on about this movie is that I enjoyed it. Is it a masterpiece? Of course not, but the music was great and there were some funny and touching scenes. It was entertaining and that is all I ask of a movie.\n\nIn my eyes Rick is very talented. The previous poster should remember that old saying that \"beauty is in the eye of the beholder\". Obviously a lot of other people see Rick with the same eye as I do. :-)" }
