Seriously.", "reviewBody": "There should be a zero rating here.....\n\nThis film was terrible. Do not watch it.\n\nBasically two young men (Michael Pitt and Brandy Corbet) take a family (Roth, Watts and their son Gearhart)hostage in a remote lake holiday home. The start of the film is decent, but then cue 1 1/2 hours of the most infuriating series of events.\n\nThere were countless opportunities for the family to escape or at least try to but...of course no, they just did nothing....nothing......nothing\n\nIf you hate films where somebody runs upstairs instead of outside when being chased by a killer or doesn\u0027t pick up a weapon when they have the chance or screams for help out in the dark when the killer is around instead of running QUIETLY to get help .......you know where im going with this...\n\nI don\u0027t care if someone tells me that the director or whatever clown was trying to get across some kind of underlying message or did all this to portray something, i really don\u0027t care and neither will anyone else, its still stupid.\n\nI have never ever written anything on this site but i feel i need to warn others as i wish someone had warned me. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM.\n\nI feel like iv lost something, not just time but something much more valuable and i don\u0027t think ill ever get it back as long as the people responsible for making this film are still alive.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
