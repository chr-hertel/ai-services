At the time it was produced, the acting crew was quite unknown. The content in Spung is timeless, because it does not follow a certain story. It reflects human relations, but apart from other relation dramas it is done in a truly honest and poetic way, sometimes surrealistic. The clipping is lovely, playful and amazing. The soundtrack is great, with mostly unsigned music and always varying, depending on the episode\u0027s theme. Spung is the Swedish answer to \"six feet under\" concerning the manuscript, and concerning the picture Spung is not far from \"requiem for a dream\" - even though Spung was made first! Certanley does Spung not touch all types om people (I did write it\u0027s honest), rather a minority such as people who interests themselves of humanity and who prefer living in a reality and not in a plastic world. I wish to see Spung on DVD so that people outside Sweden can enjoy this masterpiece too.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
