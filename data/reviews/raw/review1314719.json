But worth the watch, for these laughable moments:\n\n(1) The way \"Harlow\" tears into a chicken breast, then flings a piece of gristle onto the ground with the aplomb of Henry the VIII while lamenting (with her mouth full) to \"Arthur Landeau,\" that she can\u0027t get the parts \u0027cause she doesn\u0027t put out on the casting couch. (Could be...but I really wonder if her table manners had something to do with it?) (2) The bedroom scene with future \"Naked Gunner\" Leslie Nielsen as the \"Richard Manley\" - (Howard Hughes) - who tries to bang her, but gets \"shot down\" when she throws the proverbial drink in his face and calls him a \"dirty, rotten animal.\" I tend to agree...after all, they actually had dinner first!\n\nThere are a few more, but I\u0027ll have to rewatch the movie." }
