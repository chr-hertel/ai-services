But that\u0027s okay. Yes, this is that 80s version of the Pirates of Penzance... the one that all the critics panned as being an abomination of the Gilbert and Sullivan musical. Wasn\u0027t the traditional play a spoof on piracy? So this is a spoof of a spoof! But... I rate the success of a movie on its ability to be memorable. And this one is tough to forget... A great tribute to not only pirate movies/swashbucklers, but also cheesy 80s movies. It\u0027s got swishy swordplay, rum guzzlin\u0027, treasure huntin\u0027, pizza-fightin\u0027, smutty dialog, and singing and dancing pirates!!!!! The Pirate Movie has an advantage over the traditional Pirates of Penzance due to its filming on actual locations and animated under the sea musical numbers! Not to mention... it\u0027s got the cult status thing going... Pirates are cool again!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
