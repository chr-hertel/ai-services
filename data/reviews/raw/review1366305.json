I would have been first, second, third grade when it was on.\n\nSaturday evenings, early, around five or six p.m. and again I don\u0027t remember the net work it was on.\n\nI didn\u0027t realize at that time, it was Tom Bosley who did the father\u0027s voice. Of course I remember his best as Howard Cunningham in another 70\u0027s series, Happy Days.\n\nI can\u0027t seem to explain it with the right words, but... if I had to define the era (early seventies) to a new generation, I would do it with this TV show! I also appreciated that the daughter, although she was heavy set and wore glasses - which by some standards of the time and sadly, still exist today - had a boyfriend!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
