Now, 20 years later, I honestly don\u0027t remember why. While the music can be nice and ominous when needed, the acting is beyond terrible. The actors literally appear to be doing nothing more than reciting lines.\n\nIt really makes me think that if these people, awful actors they were, can be in a movie, anybody can.\n\nThe only thing that truly surprised me about this movie is that it didn\u0027t have any nudity in it. Generally, the worse a horror flick is, the more likelihood of seeing skin. It\u0027s what directors probably do when they know the film can\u0027t be sold on its own merits.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
