They meet beautiful Susan Abbott (Kathryn Grayson) and both fall in love with her. There\u0027s more but you\u0027ve probably guessed it.\n\nThe story (even for a 1940s musical) is ridiculous and everything is so nice and wholesome--gets annoying pretty quick. Also this movie is far too long. It\u0027s 140 minutes and that\u0027s way too much for such a silly story. There are also some boring numbers by Jose Iturbi and his orchestra. Still this is worth catching.\n\nWhen Kelly is dancing or Sinatra or Grayson are singing this becomes magical. None of the songs are particularly memorable but Sinatra had such a beautiful voice you won\u0027t care. It\u0027s shot in rich Technicolor with all the gloss MGM had. The acting is OK--Kelly is fine (although seeing him as a ladies man is pushing it) and Sinatra is just great (although seeing HIM as a shy guy was pushing it too!). Grayson is given nothing to do but she\u0027s incredibly beautiful to look at. Some shots of her literally took my breath away! There are plenty of highlights here: Sinatra and Kelly\u0027s big dancing and singing number; Sinatra singing anything; Grayson\u0027s two songs and the justly famous animated sequence in which Kelly dances with Jerry--an animated mouse! Tom does a funny cameo too. Also there\u0027s little Dean Stockwell who steals every scene he\u0027s in.\n\nSo it\u0027s too long and the plot just doesn\u0027t hold up but it\u0027s still worth catching. This was a huge hit in its day.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
