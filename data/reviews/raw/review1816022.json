It\u0027s filmed from the point of view of another child, who has the visions of the murders. Or is he the real killer? Maribel Verdu is understated in her portrayal of a poor woman in a chauvinistic society trying to cope with a jealous lover and son who\u0027s claims are suspicious to say the least. Abel Ayala is excellent in his role as a pathetic kid born into misery and poverty.\n\nOn the whole a fine film, good actors and an interesting story, well directed make for a good watch as the story develops to it\u0027s tragic end.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
