The actors have made a great interpretation because they transmit emotion to the spectator. The landscape also is perfect and the base of the film treats a subject that nowadays it even gives of what to speak. A magnificent film if you are interested on the culture and the great person who had been Che Guevara. In addition, the actions are based on a real story. I saw it in Spanish, its original language, and I think that it\u0027s better, because seeing the film in another language it loses some of its essence. I think too many people doesn\u0027t know in what conditions live the people of South America and we can know it with this film. It is also a pity and an injustice that the producers of Hollywood have not wanted to promote the film too much, although it has received numerous positive critics. Sorry for my bad English!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
