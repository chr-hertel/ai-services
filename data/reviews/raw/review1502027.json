They think no one will know. This time they copied an Argentinian film. They are full of crap. The original is much better and a lot more engaging as well as without all the rap music and other songs.\n\nWhen you find something inspiring, you don\u0027t go and copy it, rather you should get inspired by it and create your own work. I once saw a festival of Satyajit Ray films. A lot of his films were inspired by Hollywood films. With each film that was inspired, they showed us the original Hollywood film too. Ray was creative enough to make a film that did not look like the original at all and yet you could tell where the inspiration came from. It is not even that these bollywood guys don\u0027t have brains... it is just that they don\u0027t like to use their brains. \n\nThe original was made in Spanish in 2000 and is called \"Nine Queens\".", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
