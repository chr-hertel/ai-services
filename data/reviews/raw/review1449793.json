The person in question is very alive and well and in full control of his mental facilities.\n\nContacted by a Mr. Winesap, Dann Florek, to take a case of a client of his Angel meets him at this Harlem church that seems to practice Voodoo blood sacrifices instead of Christian ethics. Meeting Winsap together with his really strange and creepy-looking client a Mr. Louis Cyphre, Robert De Niro,makes Angel\u0027s blood run cold but when he\u0027s offered $5,000.00 for his services, from Cyphre, he immediately agrees to take the job.\n\nTold by Cyphre that he\u0027s looking for this former night-club and USO crooner a Johnny Favorite aka John Liebing who was badly injured in the last war in the battle of North Africa.

You get a very uncomfortable chill up your spine, like Angel does, when Cyphre tells him that he\u0027s looking for Favorite for one and one reason only: to have him pay off a debt that he owes him and get the impression from Cyphre\u0027s tone of voice that the debt is to be paid not in money but in blood!\n\nEerie and nerve-racking thriller with Harry Angel trying to track down and find, dead or alive, the very illusive Johnny Favorite with the leads he comes up with in his investigation back in NYC has Angel traveling to New Orleans.

The involvement with Epiphany and her fellow cultists results in Angel being hit or exposed to some kind of Voodoo hex that drives him to the brink of insanity if not beyond it. As Angel slowly uncovers the mystery of just who this Johnny Favorite really is and if he\u0027s still alive everyone he comes in contact with in his investigation ends up brutally murdered in what seems like a number of blood curdling and gruesome Voodoo rituals.\n\nAngel finally gets to the bottom of what all this Johnny Favorite business really is all about when he gets in touch with a Mr. Ethan Kursemark,Stocker Fontelieu, who like his late daughter Margaret, Charlotte Rampling,is an expert as well as practitioner of the Black Arts. It was Margaret who Angel first got in contact with in New Orleans that resulted, from her talking to him, in her murder where her heart was ripped out of her body!\n\nIt\u0027s after his talk with Ethan, and later with Cyphre himself, that Angel realizes the real reason why he was picked by Cyphre to investigate Johnny Favorites strange disappearance in that he himself had a lot to do with it! As the shocking truth about Angel\u0027s strange connection to Favorite comes out from his subconscious mind Angel loses it ending up mumbling to, and trying to convince, himself that it\u0027s all just a bad dream or nightmare, as the movie ends, but knowing full well deep down and in his soul that it\u0027s Not! it\u0027s the Real McCoy!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
