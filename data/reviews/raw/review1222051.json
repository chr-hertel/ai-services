Speaking as an X-men fan..this game is great! About 20 playable characters (X-Men + The Brotherhood), cool powers (tho it did somewhat bother me that some we\u0027re not equal to the powers in the comics, for example Wolverine doesn\u0027t automatically heal), good voice-work (I really like the fact that they only used Patrick Stewart from the movies in this game), the story in the game is quite good (even tho a bit clich√©, but it\u0027s obvious that Raven did try and succeed in creating a good comic-book story), the AI is OK i suppose (you only control one x-man at a time, the other 3 that are in your team are controlled by the computer but they really do seem to be able to take care of themselves quite well), the Danger Room (a cool thing, where you get to beat challenges and level up)..This part of the game is very well done and deserves praise. But speaking as a gamer..The game is fairly easy and soon you get the feeling that it\u0027s all just a routine (a fun one tho) when you keep beating up zounds and zounds of enemies, most of the levels are quite well-done, but it\u0027s obvious that some parts are only there for you to kill a lot of enemies and Level Up. The graphics make up a good comic-book feel and are good, but nothing really special...I\u0027d give this game a 7/10, it has plenty of action, the story/characters are good, X-men and the Brotherhood team up, fun and exciting boss fights and it\u0027s quite long. Otherwise it\u0027s a bit too easy and a bit routinely done...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
