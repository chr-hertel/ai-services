Re-watch Star Wars, Don\u0027t-watch Munchie.\n\nAs a responsible parent (I\u0027m speaking to those who are parents now), I (you) would not let my (your) child ever partake of this video festival of the pseudo-occult. To insinuate Munchie is satanic, to a co-viewer, is likely to illicit a chilled \u0027duh.\u0027 He is fiendish, alien, rodential, and wholly malevolent - like the Bogey man made flesh, invisible to adults, tempting children with lifestyles they could never afford (without the income made possible by years of self denial and prudent stewardship). He is a peddler of easy answers, and false ideals. He is everything the morally conscious viewer is not. He is the devil\u0027s own Ron Popeil.\n\nI pray (I mean this literally and figuratively, with an emphasis on the former) that this movie has not made the format jump to DVD. It is my hope that this type of \u0027yellow film making\u0027 died an un-mourned death in the cold nights of 1994.\n\nMunchie also loves pizza. I forgot to mention that. It comes up a lot.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
