But there\u0027s one thing which none (seem to ) have added to.......the Aston Martin DB5 - my dream car. So polished, grand and royal it looks that it really makes me view this movie\u0027s chase with Ferrari spider over and over again! The car does not look ancient and awkward at all when it rides near a Ferrari. And what a stunning beauty Isabella Scorupco is !This is a great movie indeed after 6 years of debacle of \"007\" character. The music scored when Bond visits the \"Monte Carlo casino\" is really and \"Europe\"ally beautiful. Equally good is the title song by Tina Turner. The gadgets shown by Q are breathtaking - really gave me a desire to possess at least one of them(including the BMW of course).\n\nThis movie studded 007 as my favorite character outclassing even the Jedi Knights of STAR WARS. What a hero Bond is ! If only Bond movies lacked the sexually ugly deeds of him, I\u0027m sure one of his movies would be ranked as one the 10 top movies of Bond ever. The 007 movies following this viz. TND, TWINE and DAD do not match this masterpiece by Pierce Brosnan.Improvements could have been made on the special effects when the aircraft falls from the weapons station, and the satellite blasting scenes. 9/10 for GOLDENEYE....not to be missed." }
