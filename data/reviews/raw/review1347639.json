Honest!!", "reviewBody": "When the news came out that Silent Hill was going to be made has a movie, many of the games devoted fans were skeptical - and they were right. If you have never played the Silent Hill games or you like movies based off games, then this is the choice for you.\n\nFrom the very start of the film to the very bizarre ending, you cannot help but wonder if you should have brought your control pad. This movie has its nostalgic moments for those who have played the game, but this feeling will quickly fade due to a lack of plot and a script.\n\nFeelings are that they could have at least tried to make something tangible out of this movie. The town of Silent Hill and its residents are very faithful to the game but sadly, all this is lost on a weak plot and script.\n\n4/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
