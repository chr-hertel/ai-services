Ever since I saw Halle Berry in Introducing Dorothy Dandridge, I was impressed by how similar they looked. The first African American woman to win a best Actress Oscar plays the first African American to be nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. This was her best film. The other reason I wanted to see this film was the fact that I love Carmen. Of course, the one I love is the 1984 version with Julia Migenes and Placido Domingo, but any version is worth watching.\n\nWhat is really good about this film, outside of seeing Dorothy Dandridge at the top of her game, is the change to see other great African-American stars in their prime: Emmy-winning singer Harry Belafonte, Pearl Bailey, Olga James in her first film, and Diahann Carroll (Claudine, \"Julia\"). it would have been nice to hear Dandridge and Belafonte sing, but Carmen was just too much for their voices.\n\nIt is a piece of film history and I do not regret that I had to stay up til 5:15 am to see it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
