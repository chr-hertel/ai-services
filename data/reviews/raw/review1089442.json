Martin Scorsese\u0027s love of NY truly shines through here. Just thinking about the film, which I last saw about 10 years ago, gives me a feeling of longing in the pit of my stomach. I\u0027ve never lived in NYC, but I often thought of moving there in my younger days, and this film really captures the reason why.\n\nGriffin Dunne sort of reminds me of myself in those days. He is a typical young guy, out for a night, sampling the city. It\u0027s easy to relate to him, and we really feel for him, worry about him, and laugh at and with him. His performance is superb. Ditto Rosanna Arquette in one of her first major film roles. Even though she\u0027s not on screen for long, her performance is so memorable that you feel she was in every scene.\n\nDo yourself a big favor and see this one. You\u0027ll never forget it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
