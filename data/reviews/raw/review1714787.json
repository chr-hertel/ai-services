Moreover, there is a clear lack of ideas. The plot and the scenes that are supposed to be scary are ridiculous and banal. It\u0027s not really the fact of being home-made. There are home-made movies far better than this and with a lot more of ideas.\n\nThe only explanation of its commercial success is, in my opinion, the huge advertising campaign and the smart abuse of the \"urban legend\" voices that the authors their-selves spread around.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
