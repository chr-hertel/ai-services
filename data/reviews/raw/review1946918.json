The acting was excellent from all four actors (and the mimes showed real professionalism), but the direction was the phenomenal part. I would call this a minimalist comedy, like Woody Allen or Jim Jarmusch used to do. A majority of the movie is not humor-based, but the humor that\u0027s there is high-quality. The plot is pretty clear from the description above, no need to repeat it. The creepy part comes from the fact that there is NO background music and some strange things happen. It\u0027s not scary, but a little tense at times. There are a few slow, dull parts that don\u0027t add to anything, so it loses a couple points there. Otherwise, I recommend this movie to any adult. It\u0027s probably a little too subtle for children." }
