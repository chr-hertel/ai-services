I was surfing around on this Web site when I came across this film and it kind of caught my eye when I recognized the title from the JT Leroy book. This film is a dark and disturbing picture that should only be seen by someone with an extremely strong stomach. I think that Asia Argento did a fantastic job portraying a white-trash abusive mother of an innocent kid. Just the same, I thought that the Sprouse twins, Cole and Dylan, were outstanding. This role really challenged their true skills as actors and they certainly pulled it off, I would not be surprised one bit if you see these two doing more of the drama films, rather than comedy, even though they are both very funny, I thought they did a lot better job doing a more serious part. \n\nJimmy Bennet was another surprise in the film. He plays the younger Jeremiah in the film and does a great job in it.\n\nBasically if you can handle a this film, it is definitely worth your time. But just be warned that this film is rated a STRONG \"R\" and should NEVER be seen by anyone under the age of 17, in my mind. But in all, this film does not disappoint and just really sums up the harsh reality of the darker side of life...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
