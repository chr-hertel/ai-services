Now it\u0027s personal and the hotheaded, Chance is doing anything possible to nail down Masters. In doing so, Chance is putting his and new partner\u0027s, John Pankow, career on the line, by stretching the law to suit his own agenda.\n\nNow this incredible flick doesn\u0027t hold back on its searing material and it lays it down thick and fast! William Friedkin\u0027s \"To Live and Die in L.A.\" is a sophisticatedly, hard-boiled crime thriller (adapted from the novel of Gerald Petievich, a former Secret Service agent) that has a plethora of unexpected turns and a very trance like appeal within its powerful makeup. For me, I don\u0027t care what anybody thinks, but this is one my favourite flicks and IMO, wait wait Friedkin\u0027s best. It might start off like a generic crime flick, but the symbolic themes running throughout the feature smacks you hard and are very important to the story\u0027s success in building an authentically grimy and hysterical edge amongst the highly flashy direction. There\u0027s such a strong realistic tone belted out, because of the way director Friedkin captures the explosively gritty, terribly relentless and deceitful cloud that puts you right into this hazy situation, on who\u0027s really batting for the good side. Where the fine line between cop and criminal merges into one in this artificial (counterfeit) world.\n\nThere are a lot of fine theatrical touches and the main striking one, really goes for the extraordinary, hurtling car chase that\u0027s purely dynamite and excitingly executed because of its risky set-up. Precise handling and considerable skill makes this outing visually appealing and plenty staples of beautiful photography shots gives it an hypnotic pull and a sweeping motion that carries you along for one really pressure filled ride. Definitely screaming at you is a very 80s feel, thanks largely to Wang Chong\u0027s energy packed score that always on the move with it\u0027s biting flair. Sure, people are going to complain about it, but I didn\u0027t mind it, actually.\n\nThe film\u0027s intense levels and sincerity is raised above the bar, because of picture-perfect acting from a well-ensemble cast. William Dafoe kicks in with an impressive performance as the sly weasel, Eric \u0027Rick\u0027 Masters. Making their big debuts are, William Peterson and John Pankow. Peterson puts the boot in to give an excellently raw and hard-edge performance as secret service agent Richard Chance and Pankow equally so, as the very alert new partner John Vukovich. Brilliant support roles in the shape of John Turturro as the slimy Carl Cody, one of Master\u0027s runners. Dean Stockwell plays the sneaky lawyer Bob Grimes, Darlanne Fluegel as the naturally stunning parolee Bianca Torres being used by Chance and Debra Feuer is manipulative, piercing as Master\u0027s flame, Ruth Lanier.\n\nWhat\u0027s makes this pounding flick inventively, wicked and far from contrived, is the way the film\u0027s material goes about its character\u0027s relationships with devious twists and deceptions making way for a great showstopper of an ending.\n\nA well-crafted and quite established crime thriller with explosive bursts interwoven into its glitzy, but also roughly cold embrace.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
