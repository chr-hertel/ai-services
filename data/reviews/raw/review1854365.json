What makes this work is Ashton and Brittany\u0027s on screen chemistry which really helps with the laughs.\n\nUnfortunately about 98% of the funny scenes was seen on the trailer. Do yourself a favor. If you haven\u0027t seen the trailer don\u0027t see it now.\n\nThis is funny but thats it. There nothing else its just plain funny. What makes it worse is its very predictable ending.\n\nThe acting is exactly what i expected. Ashton and Brittany were good. The acting was like just do your lines and go home kind of thing.\n\nI do recommend it if you like chick flicks.\n\n6/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
