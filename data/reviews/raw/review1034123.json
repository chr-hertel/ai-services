The theater was packed and there wasn\u0027t a dry eye in the house! Even though I knew the story already, I found the film absolutely riveting from beginning to end. I have never seen my husband cry at a movie before...ever. Everyone who worked on Looking for Angelina should be applauded for this wonderful film -- it was a gift. The actors who played Angelina and Pietro were truly magnificent in the way they brought these characters to life. The film was extremely well directed and written, and made a hundred year-old story relevant to a modern audience. I recommend it to anyone.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
