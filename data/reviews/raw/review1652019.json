The film is about how members of small armed revolutionary groups come to terms with what remains of their lives (\u0027die stille\u0027) between/after periods of action (\u0027dem Schuss\u0027), not principally about one person, let alone their \u0027legend\u0027, even if there is only one character who is continually present.\n\nSince the group in question hides out for a period in the ddr, a number of occasions arise in which the politics of armed guerillas and that of the ddr are compared, and both appear a long way off the kind of broad participatory socialism they are often mistakenly taken to aspire to. The exchanges between the main stasi officer and rita about the role of violence and the state are particularly priceless.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
