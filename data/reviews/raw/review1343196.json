Me and my friend felt so ripped off.I mean i liked Date Movie which was rated worse than this, so i thought i would like this. They really need to get the writers from 1 \u0026 2 on this! UHH!! I FEEL RIPPED OFF!!!!!!!!!!! This movie is most likely suited for children under 12 that think poop jokes are funny.1\u00262 were much more funny but I don\u0027t know what they did to this series, they just made it more disgusting and retarded. My advice to you don\u0027t spend $8 dollars like me on this and wait for the DVD release.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
