The idea was to shoot each as one long take from beginning to end, then the editors cut between the cameras in post production. Each episode was rehearsed for days before actual shooting began and shot more than once on the day it was done for real.\n\nBoth shows where shot on location at an upper west side church in NYC. The \"FEAR\" set was in the basement while the brothel set was actually constructed in a very large room upstairs.\n\nWhile \"FEAR\u0027 was shot as one continuous take the second half in the brothel was shot in three pieces. The living room scenes where shot separate from the bedroom scene as logistically it was impossible to get all three camera\u0027s with their operators and assistant\u0027s and boom mic operators from the living room down the hall to the bedroom in one continuous take." }
