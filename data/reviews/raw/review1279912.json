For Dafoe and his wife it must have been fun working together in a film for the first time, without taking into consideration that people might actually watch it. I felt like it was 90mins wasted as I waited anxiously for a plot to develop, or even begin.\n\nTry to fit this film into a genre and you won\u0027t, because it lacks a beginning, middle or ending. I\u0027ve seen \u0027arty\u0027 movies before and this doesn\u0027t even come close to being arty, abstract or original, it just seems to me to be completely pointless.\n\nI think it speaks for itself when the only persons that rated this film a 10 were the under 18 age group. No doubt for the constant pointless erotic scenes that the film was insistent on throwing at us. That is if you can call it erotic. It certainly didn\u0027t have taste.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
