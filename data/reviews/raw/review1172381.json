Visually, it\u0027s so beautiful... and yet stark and haunting (apparently it was filmed in Iceland). But what I really found engaging was that it was a noir-esquire mystery but with a very realistic feel. When opportunities present themselves for the film to go down a formulaic road, it doesn\u0027t. There\u0027s something strangely real about the film, from the first-rate acting, to the dark tone, to the deliberate pace... I think the director\u0027s decision to give this film dramatic weight will set it apart from other mystery/thrillers (I feel weird even trying to categorize it). Maybe it\u0027s just me, but I can\u0027t stop thinking about it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
