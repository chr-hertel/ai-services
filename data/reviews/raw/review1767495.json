I\u0027m afraid the shaking camera was almost enough to induce seizures, and was simply more than I was willing to bear. (Does anyone still think this type of camera-work adds to the cinematic value of a film?) I suppose some people still consider a shaking camera to be artistic in some way, but as for me, this poor camera work constantly reminds of two things:\n\n1) that I\u0027m watching a poorly filmed movie, with no chance of really getting into the story, and...\n\n2) that I need to add Dramamine to my shopping list\n\nLuckily, I borrowed this movie from the library, so I\u0027m only out my gas money. Oddly, I still feel somewhat ripped off. (Must be those high gas prices...)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
