Hate to say it folks.", "reviewBody": "OK, so I saw The Promise today. I was very very disappointed. After seeing the commercial and seeing how amazing it looked visually and how interesting the story seemed, I was shocked at how bad it actually turned out to be. The story and visuals were WAY under par when compared to the three big ones, Crouching Tiger, Hero, and House of Flying Daggers. Where those movies plots were fantastic, this one lacked and even used aspects from House of Flying Daggers. Now, I\u0027m giving this movie a three because it\u0027s attempt at vision was decent. There were some good visuals and the opening scene was memorable. I tried so hard to get into this movie and I let go all the seemingly bad effects in the stampede sequence thinking it looked a bit like Kung Fu Hustle and maybe it would go in that direction. Instead this movie doesn\u0027t pick which genre to go with. I\u0027m all for experimentation between genres, but it tried too hard to be dramatic and only inserted a little humor thus making it way too lame. Again, I wanted this movie to be good, but I could not get into it. Hour and a half movies should not drag like this.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
