Stay away!", "reviewBody": "First. What is Christmas, people? Everybody forgot what does it mean. Is it all about gifts and toys? And about the wizard \"Santa\"? People, open your eyes, are we dolls with unnatural false smiles and mimics? It is so terrible to see all these American false-smiles, false-emotions. Christmas - is the celebration of birth of Jesus Christ. Was it in the movie? I did not see it at all. Second. Santa Clause - supposed to be saint! Santa - it is not a name. \"Santa\" means \"saint\". What is in the movie? Saintfull \"what\u0027s up\u0027s\" from Santa, typical business man image (even though he does not take money for toys). I did not see any saint in this \"Santa\". Jack Frost - is playing awfully. But for Americans this is OK, because they are acting in such unnatural way in their real life like this. Third. What kind of psychological effect on children will be from \"Santa\u0027s divorce\"? You think movies are harmless? What little child takes normal in his gentle years will be normal for the rest of his life! And Santa, absolutely positive person, had a divorce, new family, blah, blah, blah. It means, that already screwed society mind will be screwed even more. Divorce is becoming even more normal... And this is most awful part of the movie! You, people, prohibit advertisement of smoking in your movies, but you promote divorces this way. Family in the child\u0027s mind becomes very fragile. Little change in a mood - let\u0027s divorce. This is not right! As a father I THINK about what my son will see and what effect will come out of a movie which he will see. Children learn from movies and cartoons a lot... People! Don\u0027t waste your child brain on such harmful movie...", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
