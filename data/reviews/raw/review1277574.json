Would we live in a matrix style alternate reality where we could have more control over our everyday existence and have control over other people or would there be a big fat nothing. The acting is superb and the storytelling enjoyable.\n\nThis doesn\u0027t preach to the viewer yet sets its message out in pure and simple terms. How many of us have wondered if we didn\u0027t have a planet earth to exist on what would there be? Would we exist in some other form? This film attempts to answer these questions and maybe it attempts to pose some questions too. It is very sharply observed by the Wachowski brothers and has many fans across the globe. The performances (even from keanu reeves, a usually below-par actor) as excellent and it rightly received many special effects awards and plaudits.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
