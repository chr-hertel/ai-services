Grow some balls and accept that not every film is Lord Of The Rings and appreciate entertaining straight to video productions. For what this film is, its good, end of subject. And just because everyone apparently has the same generic opinion on just about everything as everybody else means they are most probably wrong.\n\nthanks", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
