There is enough bad press about the military from the 1/2 of 1% that are bad human beings, we do not need to make up disgusting scenes as the meat sandwich. It is disgusting and very much in bad taste. That was NOT funny, it was crude and an insult to one of the finest fighting forces in the world... There is enough bad press about Gitmo you did not need to do the meat sandwich scene, people will think that such conduct is tolerated. The rest of the movie was mildly funny.\n\nthe US Army is one of the finest fihting forces due to the technology it possesses but that\u0027s all. Sick bastards are everywhere including the US army. I understand that you are a patriot and you don\u0027t want to accept the truth", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
