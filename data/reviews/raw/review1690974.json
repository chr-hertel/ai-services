The story was weak, and the CGI robots were poorly composited and scaled. Pros....There were explosions, fireballs are cool. I also liked how they used real water for the rain, and ddint try to digitally add rain later. It\u0027s obvious that the Asylum knew this from the start and that they don\u0027t care. \n\nThe Asylum\u0027s demographic is you suckers who buy/rent their videos by mistake. And apparently, there\u0027s enough of you out there that they can do this and turn a substantial profit. It\u0027s sad, funny, and aggravating all at the same time.\n\nshame on you for making those producers millionaires.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
