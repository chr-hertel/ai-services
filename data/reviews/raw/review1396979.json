When I watched this, I had no expectations. I didn\u0027t really know what to expect. I was never much of a Batman fan, so I just watched this movie to have some fun.\n\nThe first half hour of the movie is excellent. The rest is just bad. Christopher Nolan does not know how to make good action sequences. He just pretends there\u0027s an earthquake and shakes the camera a lot. So we don\u0027t really see anything.\n\nBut the big problem is the plot, the story. Like I said, the first half hour is excellent. Liam Neeson is great, and Christian Bale seems to be a more real, emotional Batman. But then... poof. After the first half hour, the emotion disappears. It just turns to another usual \"bad guys have some evil plan to destroy the city\" plot. And the emotional, more human Batman also disappears. And instead, we get the usual Batman... just another super-hero. But this time, he\u0027s in crappy action sequences. Chrsitian Bale doesn\u0027t need to act. Because it\u0027s just bad action sequences after bad action sequences, and he just needs to say his lines without emotion. It\u0027s the action that matters. Because it\u0027s just another blockbuster. And then there\u0027s the terrible twist, that completely ruins Liam Neeson\u0027s character.\n\nFortunately, Katie Holmes saves the movie.\n\n(Note: I\u0027m being ironic. Katie Holmes is TERRIBLE, and she needs some acting lessons).\n\nSo, overall, what is Batman Begins? Well, it\u0027s a blockbuster. With bad action sequences. And a story with no heart. The first half hour is excellent, but that doesn\u0027t make up for two hours of bad cinema.\n\nIt\u0027s just a bad movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4" } }
