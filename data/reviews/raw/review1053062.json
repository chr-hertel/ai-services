Watch for a young Alan Hale, Jr., later to be the Skipper in \"Gilligan\u0027s Island.\" Take a look at the writing credits for the writer of this one. Sterling. Also, a great feel for 40\u0027s baseball fans, baseball stadiums, just baseball. I loved this film as a kid, still love it now.\n\nThis film should be as much a harbinger of spring as the first robin. Don\u0027t miss it!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
