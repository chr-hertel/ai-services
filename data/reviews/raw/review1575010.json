The Marine isn\u0027t really worth buying, but it is renting and watching it at least once.\n\nMy final thought is simple:The marine is stupid,cheesy no brainer entertainment. It does what its supposed to do,give you something to do when your bored.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
