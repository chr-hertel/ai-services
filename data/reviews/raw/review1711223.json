I enjoyed how they showed how much everyone had changed from the season. First they showed what they looked like in the series then what they looked like after the series. I was pleasantly surprised to see how much John Walton had changed since the series. He had such white hair and I think takes after his father Zeb Walton. I didn\u0027t know he made a mistake when he said \"oh Pa. It\u0027s been 15 years and I miss you like it was yesterday.\" Then he says \" I remember you once told me there\u0027s no pain like the one your kids can give you.\" I really took that to heart. I have to say I put my self in his place and could see where he was coming from. The mother look like she was getting tired of doing her role as Olivia Walton. Anyways, I really do hope they do a reunion movie again real soon. Thank you.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
