It brings generations together.\n\nMalo Misto, and later Velo Misto, are the funniest when describing the mentality, the culture of Dalmatia. Watching some of the episodes would be useful to anyone preparing to spend any significant amount of time in this part of the world.\n\nTo those of us who hail from this flamboyant little world, it brings memories of childhood and reminds us that we really do tend to \"produce too much history\".\n\nAs reading and watching a play by Shakespeare, watching a product of Miljenko Smoje\u0027s work brings one to the conclusion that history continues to repeat itself, while human nature in its ugliness and beauty doesn\u0027t change, politics is politics, and life is life! \n\nDear Smoje, we have missed you and always will!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
