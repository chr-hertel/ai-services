John Oppenheimer,who is Rapturious (Robert Oppel) gets haunted by his past,when demons realize who he became. When a series of creepy events happen,Rapturious starts to realize somethings awry. That\u0027s the basic storyline,but what I loved was the weird imagery director Kamal Ahmed used in the horror sequences. A lot of sex and bloody guts fused together in these hallucinations Rapturious gets when he takes a mysterious drug called \"Afterlife\". Some people wrote that this movie looked \"Low-budget\",I have absolutely no idea what they\u0027re talking about. This movie was shot brilliantly,with terrific composition and cinematography. I feel Ahmed was going a \"static\" old-school style on purpose,and me being from Europe,I loved the pacing of the narrative. This film is unlike the MTV influenced films America makes nowadays. I look forward to Ahmed\u0027s next project!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
