Unfortunately, Weber isn\u0027t nearly as domineering as she needs to be, which renders Chase\u0027s reluctant obedience all the more difficult to comprehend, and most of the comic situations (including an unlikely song and dance number between Chase and Lawrence at a gathering of hobo\u0027s!) are only fitfully amusing. Chase co-directed the film with Harold Law.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
