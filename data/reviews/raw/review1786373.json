Twelve year old Jamie is more than a little weird. In fact, he could be the poster child for abnormal behavior 101. His perverse outlook on the opposite sex includes voyeurism, stalking, and kinky baths. Add this weirdness to his troglodyte friends in the pit, who constantly need feeding, and things are never dull. His talking teddy and strange apparitions only add to the fun. The movie has nudity and gore, along with some dark comedy. The plot is intriguing, and if fully developed with a decent budget, could lead to a great horror/black comedy. This is a film truly begging for a remake. Despite the marginal acting and plot development, \"The Pit\" is entertaining. - MERK", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
