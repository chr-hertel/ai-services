But, the concerned ladies of Laredo report the disappearance of British schoolmaster Richard Haydn (as Jonathan Pringle), who was to have arrived from London. Despite his aching tooth, Reese is sent, by Capt. Parmalee (Philip Carey) out to find the wayward Mr. Haydn. The going gets tough when an old foe, Ken Lynch (as Anson Jones), recognizes Reese, and seeks revenge for a past prison term.\n\nAfter several lackluster episodes, \"Laredo\" gets back in the saddle. This episode has good direction (Paul Stanley), writing (Edward J. Lasko), and photography (William Margulies). The opening action is taken from prior adventures (the flaming arrow hitting the wagon train is a dead giveaway); but, the stock footage, new location, and set material blend very well.\n\nMr. Brand\u0027s toothy \"Reese\" is at his most memorable; and, though underutilized, the series co-stars all appear - and to good effect. Hank Patterson (Fred Ziffel of \"Green Acres\"), and Lynch\u0027s mob (Len Lesser, Paul Mantee, Erik Holland) lead a strong supporting cast.\n\n***** A Very Small Assignment (3/17/66) Paul Stanley ~ Neville Brand, Richard Haydn, Ken Lynch", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
