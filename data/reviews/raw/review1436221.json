Additionally, some critics tried to frame it as a failed attempt at \"art-house\" cinema. However, this simply is one of the best films ever made of a Steinbeck work, and one of the best films of the 1980s. Poignant, masterfully photographed, funny and sweet, brilliantly acted and directed, it is a must see for anyone who loathes mainstream American film making and yearns for literate cinema. Nolte is at his best, acting with a magnificent range. Winger is perfect as Suzy. The adaptation of Steinbeck\u0027s \"Sweet Thursday\" is spot on. The ensemble acting of the tramps led by one of the greatest character actors of all time, M. Emmett Walsh and Frank McRae and the soundtrack including Doctor John\u0027s piano stylings, make this a film of metaphor and wonderful enchantment. If you haven\u0027t seen this film, turn off your phone, light a fire, and settle in for the ride of your life, emotionally and artistically.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
