The Magdalene women have to bear up against sexual, physical and mental abuse in consequence for the sins they have committed.\n\nThose horrible scenes which show the inmates struggle to maintain honor and pride are as hard to watch as it is frustrating. It allows you to get a feeling of the desperate situation and the bleakness all in the convent. The film represents the dark atmosphere authentically and is a good balanced critic of society.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
