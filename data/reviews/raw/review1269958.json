It did have some stupidness 2 it but there was sense involved in it.. I would just like to say all in all i thought it was a pretty good movie and people need to give it a chance because it is not a BAD! movie.. And also i think people now a days are just 2 focused on all the special effects of todays generation we need to get past all that and recognize a good movie cause when it all comes down 2 it this movie is it shows some of the basic everyday situations that we all experience and thats what\u0027s important in my opinion........\n\n(Have a nice day)", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
