One cast member in particular stands out, however, and I am positive not even the producer who gave him the job recognizes the amazing strengths the actor and his character adds to the story line. I am sure \"Billy Desmond\" (aka J. August Richards) was written in with the intent of bringing the now much sought after (and definitely much needed) \"Grey\u0027s Anatomy\" diversity to the forefront of American television, especially by giving him some of the same cutting edge workaholic, misogynistic characteristics usually reserved for white characters. This kid has serious skill that should not be overlooked just because the show gets a little hacky. Young Mr. Richards has had the outrageous good fortune to have scenes written for him on this show that could have been written for any actor, not just \"the\" African-American, or in his case, the Panamanian-American, on the show. I have noticed that the latest two episodes will downplay his role to an almost nonexistent degree as opposed to the three episodes prior. Hopefully this will not be an ongoing trend. At any rate, I would suggest to anyone who hasn\u0027t seen the show to give it a try. Don\u0027t make the mistake of making comparisons; It\u0027s not as good as Law and Order- I\u0027m a huge fan.The key to L\u0026A\u0027s success is they never delve too far into the personal lives of the characters. It\u0027s about the cases. That\u0027s why it\u0027s been on so long, and yet we still love Elliot and Olivia, Gore and Aames. It\u0027s just the opposite with Conviction. Lotsa story line on the personal lives ... still, check it out and watch from the beginning if it doesn\u0027t get filled in with a summer replacement. \n\nJaime August Richards is going to be a star." }
