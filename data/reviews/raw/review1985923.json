Anyway, the acting is particularly good esp. Julie Graham Max Beesley and Paterson Joseph-seem to remember him being good in The Beach as well-anyway anyone who hasn\u0027t watched this yet, tune in and give it a go, thoroughly recommended, and OK the idea of the characters being on the same road at the same time was far-fetched, but for me, it worked. 10/10" }
