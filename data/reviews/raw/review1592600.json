But to say that is to pigeon-hole a film that is excellent, full-stop. It\u0027s engaging to any audience. It\u0027s extremely well-crafted and stays with you long after you\u0027ve seen it.\n\nErin Kelly is convincing as Annabelle, a self-assured seventeen year-old. Diane Gaidry\u0027s performance of Simone is real, vulnerable, powerful, complex. It is this film\u0027s complexity that confuses the moral questions of the student-teacher relationship. The situation is not so black and white.\n\nDirector/writer Katherine Brooks is a talent to watch.\n\nDeeply moving and imaginative film. Funny, tragic. Exceptional direction, acting and script. Go see it now!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
