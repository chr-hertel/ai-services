No, it\u0027s not an episode of Maury, it\u0027s the story of a young girl who gets pregnant and tries to find a couple to adopt while, as she puts it, deals with \"things way beyond my maturity level.\"\n\nJuno is a very good, unique story and one of my favorite movies of the year. If you ask me (and in a sense you are.) the real star of this film is the script. Written by first time screenwriter Diablo Cody, Juno really is as they say \"this year\u0027s little miss sunshine\" It\u0027s refreshingly original, quirky and funny. It is also very heartwarmingÂ…but only towards the end. Through the majority of the film, like little miss sunshine, things pretty much get worse for the protagonists as time goes on but it is certainly not without laughs throughout. Besides, that is what makes the ending all the more powerful. The thing that struck me the most was the honesty in the dialogue. It certainly isn\u0027t completely realistic and Juno and her friend have more witty things to say then is probably natural but nonetheless, the dialogue in the film is probably more realistic than most. The film\u0027s acting is also something of note. Ellen Page, who was nominated for an Oscar for her role, delivers a great performance. In addition, the other actors in the film, such as Michael Cera and Jason Bateman also give good performances. Like his other roles, Michael Cera who plays Juno\u0027s love interest (more or less), plays awkward better than any actor I have seen. If you\u0027ve seen Superbad or any episode of Arrested Development than you know what I\u0027m talking about.\n\nJuno is defiantly a movie worth seeing. Juno defiantly isn\u0027t a laugh-out-loud kind of comedy but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s what they\u0027re going for. With a good cast, simple humor, and a believable script, you can\u0027t really go wrong and I don\u0027t think they did.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
