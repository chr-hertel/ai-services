I have seen both versions, and there\u0027s not really much of a difference. Stone tones down some of the gay undertones in the director\u0027s cut, conforming to many criticisms. He also evens out the flashbacks a bit, which I think works better. It doesn\u0027t really matter which version you watch, if you don\u0027t like one you won\u0027t like the other, simple as that. Honestly, I only bought the director\u0027s cut because the entire movie fits on one disc. I liked Alexander, and it was by no means a bad movie.\n\nStone explores Alexander The Great\u0027s personal life more than his battle tactics, which many believed to be a bad move. In a way, it was. Anyone who views the film alone would probably never get a grasp of what a brilliant mind he actually was. What I thought was very interesting though, was Alexander\u0027s unquenchable thirst to conquer new worlds, to push further, until it inevitably destroyed him. Ironically not dying in a battle, but in his bed, taken ill by bad water. So what drove Alexander? Was it to desperately win approval from his parents? Stone\u0027s vision seems to think this played a big part. While all the elements come together to make Alexander far more emotionally vulnerable than say, Maximus from Gladiator or Spartacus from...Spartacus, we\u0027re given an unexpected new kind of historical epic protagonist. I guess some people just didn\u0027t want to accept it, or maybe weren\u0027t ready for it.\n\nAlexander was not a bad movie. It is at times a little misguided, and there are some aspects that just didn\u0027t fly too well, but overall it was very good. Stone has given us a unique look at one of history\u0027s greatest figures. It did not do well financially, and some of its critics were absolutely merciless, but you\u0027ll never know until you judge it for yourself. \n\nMy rating: 7/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
