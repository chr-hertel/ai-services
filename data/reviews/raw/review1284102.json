I love this film! The character Carrey creates is amazingly complex! It\u0027s beautiful to watch, poetry of the mind! Sweetly lovable but truly tragic, so many emotions! It\u0027s great! It really made me think about myself and I have a different look on life. I advise watching this before anyone tries to entertain with comedy, it\u0027s so original. The psychology also is perfectly portrayed, the character will make you think, feel pity, laugh inexplicably and long to be understood, just as Andy needs to be. I couldn\u0027t stop watching (as such I handed in some coursework late because for some reason it was on at about 11pm but it was worth it.)\n\nBRILLIANT!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
