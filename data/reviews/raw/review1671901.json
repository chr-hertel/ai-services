There have been many instances of people (not just celebrities) being stalked and harmed. But after listening to Brian\u0027s reasons for wanting to date/meet Drew Barrymore, you can\u0027t help but cheer the guy on. He didn\u0027t Google her address or hire a private eye to find out her whereabouts; he went to a psychic (who was surprisingly accurate in her prediction). The only questionable thing he did was fake his way into the premiere, but even then you have to give him credit for the moxie. I would never have done it (No! Not even for Stockard!)It was genuinely sad after the 30 days had passed with no response from Drew and it was genuinely exciting to see him realize his dream. I\u0027m glad Brian was able to meet her (she seemed like a very nice person). Congratulations to Brian. Not many people get to live out the biggest dream.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
