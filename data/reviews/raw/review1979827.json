Knowing full well that they\u0027re being lead into a trap, they send James Bond to meet up with a defecting Russian agent named Tania Romanova. As James Bond searches for the Lektor he must fight off SPECTRE agents who are trying to kill him at every turn.\n\nOnce again, just like Dr. No, this is a James Bond film that shows how James Bond should be. Once again the film focuses more on plot than action, and keeps the one liners and over the top comedic scenes to a minimum. Connery once again plays Bond to perfection, portraying him as a ruthless secret agent with nothing on his mind but getting the job done. The plot to this film is much more exciting than Dr. No, and offers a few more exciting action sequences, so the movie doesn\u0027t drag as much. In this film we are introduced to Q branch, and James Bond receives his first real gadget. A briefcase that shoots bullets, contains a collapsible sniper rifle, and sprays tear gas if opened by anyone except Bond. We are also introduced to Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the head of the evil SPECTRE organization, though we don\u0027t see his face. This film also includes one of the most exciting hand-to-hand combat sequences in a Bond movie when James Bond fights SPECTRE agent Red Grant, played menacingly by Robert Shaw, on board a train.\n\nEven though this film drags less than Dr. No, some parts do drag slightly, but not enough to turn you off of the film. One thing this film lacks is a discernible villain. Bond only fights two SPECTRE agents while Blofeld sits on the sidelines through all of the film. This doesn\u0027t hurt the movie, but it leaves it quite open ended. Overall, a very good sequel and one of the best entries into the James Bond franchise.\n\n8/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
