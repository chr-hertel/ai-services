Even though I am in it I must say that I think some of the bad reviews are mean spirited and downright unfair. Above all there are some very moving scenes from Jennifer Love Hewitt (who when I met her in Bristol came across as having an unbelievably lovely personality being a wonderful ambassador for Americans). The scene where she cuts up the hubby\u0027s suits shows some heartbreaking facial expressions which any female who has been cheated on will empathise with. The actress playing the artist/mistress gave a cracking performance too - great accent and venom portrayed. I am not surprised it was such a big hit in South Korea. I watched it having read bad reviews and feeling disappointed that it hadn\u0027t gone big screen - but when I saw it I was pleasantly surprised. I do so hope directors will use Jennifer Love Hewitt\u0027s talents in more films. It also reflects contemporary Bristol so well - great shots of the Suspension Bridge \u0026 interiors of our modern buildings. It reflects the nuances of \"love\" in the early 21st century and future generations will enjoy it for that reason rather in the way we smile when we look back at representations of Victorian \"courtship\" and love." }
