I had seen the previews and they just didn\u0027t really spark my interest.\n\nI have just seen this movie for the first time tonight and I can say that it would have been a huge mistake for me not to see it,as well as it will be a huge mistake for you should you choose not to see this movie. In fact, I enjoyed it so much that after watching it with my parents and other miscellaneous family members, that I borrowed it from them and took it home to watch with my wife. She loved the film as much as I did.\n\nIt is a great movie for either gender, male or female. Perfect for watching whether by yourself, or with friends, but best watched with a loved one. Enough romance to keep the ladies happy but not so much that it turns it solely into a \"Chick Flick\".\n\nDon\u0027t even waste your time or money with bothering to rent this movie. Just go buy it. Definitely one you will want in your collection.\n\nI give it 9/10.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
