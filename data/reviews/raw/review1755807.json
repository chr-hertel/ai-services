Keiko seems to be a good woman in contrast to Emiko, but Keiko\u0027s also having an affair with a married man. Yamashita repents his crime but deeply suppresses it, while Takasaki outwardly repents but only on a superficial level. The film shows many aspects of Japanese culture, and one striking scene is the attempted rape by Takasaki. It shows that Japan is still a very male led society, and women have a lower status.\n\nI would have liked more exploration the subplot about Yamashita\u0027s sanity. It would contrast perfectly with Keiko\u0027s mother." }
