Alarmingly believable", "reviewBody": "In the \u0027Horror\u0027 genre, films can have several effects. Some build up the tension and then startle you, some attempt to disgust the viewer, some frustrate the viewer through the foolish actions of the characters, and only a few are truly horrifying. \"Wolf Creek\" is one that is truly disturbing. Tragic and moving, even.\n\nNot only among horror films but among films in general this movie stands out. The script is phenomenal, the acting flawless, and the cinematography is a work of art. The characters, while not especially entertaining, are realistic and appealing. In the heat of things, they make some poor decisions, but unlike so many movies, their mistakes are very understandable.\n\n\"Wolf Creek\" is not a movie for cheap thrills, nor is it especially entertaining. This film does not cater to the conventional, teen horror fans. There are no triumphant moments, no clever deaths, there is just the simple, frightening, and saddening picture of a victimization. There is a feeling of senselessness in \"Wolf Creek\" that is reminiscent of the original \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\"\"Wolf Creek\" is a glimpse of the dark side of the earth that is not for the lighthearted.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
