The film followed the relationship that developed between a struggling actress (Turner) and an unemployed black woman (Juanita Moore) and their daughters. Lana becomes a Broadway star in about 10 minutes and Moore becomes her housekeeper. Their daughters grow up and turn into Sandra Dee (Susie) and Susan Kohner (Sarah Jane). Sarah Jane\u0027s father was white and she has spent much of her life trying to pass for white because she is very light-skinned but her mother will never let her forget that she is black. There is an unintentionally funny scene where Sarah Jane\u0027s high school boyfriend finds out she\u0027s half-black and beats her up. I know that may not seem comical, but Kohner\u0027s half-baked performance takes it to that level as she\u0027s lying in an alley wiping her face and screaming at her boyfriend to come back. Lana has her share of funny moments too...especially laughable is a scene where she agrees to accompany a lecherous agent (Robert Alda in a very amusing performance)to a party and finally realizes what he expects in exchange for helping her with her career, symbolized (as it had to be in the 50\u0027s) by his \"gift\" of a mink coat to wear to the party. Sandra Dee also garners chuckles as Lana\u0027s neglected daughter grows up and falls in love with her mother\u0027s boyfriend (John Gavin) and loses it when he rejects her. The only completely satisfying performance in the film is by Juanita Moore as Annie, who brings so much more substance to the role than the script provides. She received an Oscar nomination for her performance as did Susan Kohner (God knows why). For unintentional giggles, this movie rates right up there with VALLEY OF THE DOLLS. Check it out.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
