If you loved Miami Vice the TV Show then you will still like this movie. It has all the content the TV show did the Boats,cars,guns,drugs and stunning women BUT this is a serious movie about Miami Vice it goes deep into what it is like to be in undercover operations. Of course your going to foresee the story they go after drug dealers and so on but give me a break thats Miami Vice. This movies use of camera angles and music are just as moving as Heat and Manhunter. Michael Manns touch is all over this movie and I expected nothing less. I have read a lot of negative reviews about the movie and was upset to see people could not get it out of their head Don Johnson was not in it. See the reason why Colin is Crockett and Jamie is Tubbs is because they are planning two more Miami Vice Movies. They need lasting actors for this Don Johnson was outstanding but this is not the TV SHOW GO SEE THIS MOVIE IT\u0027S WORTH IT!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
