The dialog was plausible and believable but the acting was akin to watching gazelles being chased down and ripped to shreds by lions. Yes, you continue to watch, but yet part of you feels guilt and remorse for doing so. \n\nWhen the actor that is the most believable as their character is a city buildings inspector (No spoiler there-it\u0027s known from the get-go) that is only a bit-part (famous actors refer to them as cameos!) you know someone in casting is keenly familiar with the term \u0027Head Trauma\u0027.\n\nGood to kill some time but only if you want to sit around by yourself and not have to wait for your friends to deride you for suggesting to give this movie a try.\n\nGiving this movie anything above a 3-5 is misguided generosity.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
