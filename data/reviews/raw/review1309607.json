I was immediately gripped. This, to me, was a spaceship filled with Han Solo types in the original Star Wars. A series where anything goes! I was left wanting more and Joss Whedon delivered in a big way. Serenity essentially ties up all of the loose ends that were left from Firefly. The only actor I knew about previously was Ron Glass from the Barney Miller series and let me tell you these bunch of no name actors delivered beautifully in this film. The acting is superb, great direction and stunning visuals on a not so big budget. The story goes that super genius River Tam is kidnapped by \"the alliance\" who are trying to create a Utopia of sorts by creating a world without sin. Her brother helps her escape and the alliance is put in full force to try and recapture her. The characters are not moral but you still can not help falling in love with them. A must see but do not see it until you have seen the Firefly series first.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
