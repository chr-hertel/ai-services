Keep the noisy neighbors in the plot. Have Sam\u0027s Aunt and Uncle pop in and out. I have been going to the theater to see Movies for over 50 years and this was the first time I have never walk out in the middle of a Movie. I was hoping it would get better but it did not. Nicole Kidman is one of the finest Actors in the business..but her talent could not save this movie. Will Ferrell should stay on the TV screen...no acting ability at all for this movies. I was very disappointed that all the hype about this movie was just that...just HYPE...\n\nGerald J.
