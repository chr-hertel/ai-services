Hey, lets end violence, get educated and erase the color lines. This is not a new message and somewhat a Hollywood staple, but its a good one.\n\nThe Bad: It reinforces every stereotype of race. The \u0027uneducated black gangster\u0027, \u0027the sassy Hispanic girl who\u0027s trying not to get pregnant\u0027, and \u0027the nerdy white guy with no friends.\u0027 Gimme a break! Its 2007, aren\u0027t we past this?! Hollywood and MTV, please stop your racial profiling. \n\nAs a teacher, I found this to very self-indulgent for teenagers. Lines like \u0027no one understands us\u0027, or \u0027its so hard for us.\u0027 Teenagers are self-centered enough, without movies like this reinforcing it.\n\nLike other posters said...its a complete ripoff of Dangerous Minds, Finding Forrester...etc.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
