WOW!!! the name never left me like Walt\u0027s Bambi. :) but then, we do have many new ones, latest ones are also very good, they have got better machines to do the graphics and visual effects, however, making in those days when there was so much limitations to production and Fox effects, it enchanted a person with a grand imagination. Treasure Island was one of the wonderful ones, journey to the center of the earth was another which amazed and the list goes on and on, the classics were also made films but without belittling today, excellent cartoons are made today, the colors were amazing. Hope so the art continues to give audience wonderful thoughts. Thanks.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
