If it was made with eyes wide open and written, to begin with, as a post-modern comment on the nature of it\u0027s subject; as well as it\u0027s stars then fantastic. I do wonder though; it reminded me a lot of Adaptation a film about an unfilmable novel which became a film about adapting an unfilmable novel. I think it\u0027s possible that everything that was a negative about filming the book became a positive in the new version. The budget, or lack of, for the battle scene; financial pressure to have a big star.\n\nAnyway regardless of any clever post modern devices; the film was hilarious. Brydon and Coogan were class acts throughout and anyone who didn\u0027t understand it; well maybe the joke\u0027s on you.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
