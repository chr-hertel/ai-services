I am now trying to find it on DVD but fear that it has not been released. I was captivated by the soulful images of the Goldens and other animals, the water and the overall feeling of peace and good will it seemed to convey. I was totally relaxed by the time the film ended and left wanting to see more, which is why I\u0027m trying to learn whether it is available on DVD yet. I was not previously familiar with any of Bruce Weber\u0027s work but will now certainly be looking for more films and photos by him.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
