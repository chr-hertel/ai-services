Lewis\u0027s masterpiece now a full length movie.", "reviewBody": "This has been my favorite book since 5th grade. I been looking forward in seeing this movie too.\n\nLion, Witch, and the Wardrobe is a novel taken place in 1940 back when WW2 had already occurred in England. 4 kids had to move to the countryside to avoid getting hurt from the Bombing that occurred in the city areas. They have to live at the Professor\u0027s(who\u0027s suppose to be a relative of theirs)Large Manor. They were given strict rules in not doing anything too noisy while they\u0027re in the Manor. The kids got bored with nothing to do so they played hide and go seek. One of them who was a young girl named Lucy decides to hide in the wardrobe. But soon she discovers that there\u0027s an another world beyond the wardrobe.\n\nI think it was a perfect movie adaption of the 55 year old novel. It was very truthful to the original book itself. A few small changes here or there, but it followed the book the way it should. The special effects are excellent. Some humor here and there. I was very satisfied with how the movie went.\n\nI\u0027m sure other Narnia fans will be satisfied with this movie as well. It\u0027s rated PG for Battle Sequences, light fighting, no gory fighting. There wasn\u0027t a drop of blood in the this movie. So someone 10 and older or mature enough for a PG movie can see it.\n\nI give it a 9.8/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
