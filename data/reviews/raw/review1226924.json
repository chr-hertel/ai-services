Sadly, I haven\u0027t seen it in years, and wish that I could find it on VHS or DVD, or that they would play in on AMC Classics occasionally. I love Gregory Peck, who did an outstanding job in playing the lead role in this classic psychological mystery. The viewer is also treated to seeing a very youthful Walter Mathau and an even younger George Kennedy. Like any well written mystery, Mirage keeps the viewer in suspense throughout, revealing the truth at the end after a journey so satisfying it leaves you wishing that it wasn\u0027t over. I highly recommend this movie if you can ever find it. If you catch it on AMC classics, etc. make sure you set your VCR. You\u0027ll be glad you did!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
