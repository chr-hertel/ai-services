Big Surprise!", "reviewBody": "I took my grandkids to see this movie at a $1 a person theater. I really didn\u0027t expect much, after taking them to see Madagascar(boring!). But I must say that I love this movie. I\u0027m going to take my other grandkids to see it tomorrow. Somehow I missed who the voice of Hammy was, so I came home and looked it up. Steve Carell was SO good as this hyper squirrel! I also absolutely loved the possum dad, William Shatner, he was so great making fun of himself. I\u0027m getting this on DVD also! \n\nI just don\u0027t like any animated movies anymore, besides Shrek, but I LOVED this one. I\u0027ve told everyone about it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
