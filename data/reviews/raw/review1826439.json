That being so, the Coen brothers simply say to their critics, \"such is life.\"\n\nTheir film is about exactly that - the absurdity of life in that no matter how much we try and take things into our own hands, do justice or make people claim responsibility for their actions, that life will often sucker-punch us out of left field.\n\n\"Lebowski\" is about a man of that name that goes by \"The Dude.\" He\u0027s a completely miserable, low-life character played by Jeff Bridges that for some reason you care about. As the Coen brothers are notorious for, The Dude gets caught up with some bad people for no reason other than he shares the same exact name as someone who happens to have money. When two guys break into his home thinking he is the other Lebowski and one pees on his rug, it all goes down hill from there for The Dude.\n\nWith a stellar supporting cast, led by John Goodman who is incredible in this film as The Dude\u0027s best bowling buddy and insane converted-Jewish Vietnam vet, \"Lebowski\" is original and deep-belly laughing funny. But not only that, the events of the film all say something important about when we choose to take action and when it might be best to let things be. The film\u0027s scenes are either funny and quotable, creepy and eerie or both. Usually both. All the gags, however, seem to have a point. If not in what their message is/how it contributes to the film, than at least in the way they grab your attention. Every scene in the film is effective in this way.\n\n\"Lebowski\" is undeniable proof that comedy can have a purpose other than mere entertainment. It is a film with purpose beyond humor. It is both strange, funny and meaningful. While not nearly as recognized or critically acclaimed as \"Fargo,\" per say, the effective combination that is so rare in film definitely warrants Coen brothers fans the rationale to say \"Lebowski\" is their best project.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
