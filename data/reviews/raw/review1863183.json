The right to hit back at the Nazis even when they have killed one\u0027s wife and children.\n\nI laughed during this film at some trivial thing, and the guy next to me told me not to laugh as it was a serious business. I didn\u0027t reply even though I wanted to call him a sheisskopf, or to tell him that I was a Communist and he was a Nazi. He was probably Jewish, as I am, but all he learned from the Nazis was to be self-righteous.\n\nForgive me for airing my anger here but does anyone else see that in the most serious of moral dilemmas die Menschen is nur sehr komisch?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
