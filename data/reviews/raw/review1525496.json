The film is combined of unstopped action,shoot out,violence,fighting, romance between both protagonists and a minimum characterization.Beside abundant fist fights in which body parts are slice off and limbs are slit or blasted apart.Savage and brutal killings make only recommended for those adults no squeamish and with strong stomach enough to take it.The movie gets a certain similarity with Charles Bronson films from ¨Death wish¨series for the matter,the avenger,thus the main personage ,the Vigilante, makes of judge,jury and executioner.It\u0027s a run a mill action movie because from the start until the end the action packed is continued ,in fact ,the final confrontation is breathtaking and extremely violent.The film is from Steven Seagal first period when the movies were of middling or high budget(Above the law,Marked for death,Out of justice,On deadly ground,The patriot),nowdays are of bow budget(Out of kill,Submerged,Foreigner,Black Dawn). The picture has an atmospheric synthesizer music fitting to action by David Michael Frank,nicely cinematography by Matthew F.
