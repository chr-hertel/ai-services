She plays a 19 year old girl who is trying in a way to find her self and she has a tendency to embrace all the fads of the day. It shows a deep look into the pshyche of a young girl growing up. She has issues with her lifestyle, her family, the men in her life yet she still manages (some how) to keep it all together.\n\nI recommend this movie to anyone interested in the genre. Don\u0027t believe what \"others\" have read... it is a quality film!\n\nHighly recommended!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
