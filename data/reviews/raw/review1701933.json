Elizabeth Montgomery twitched her way through eight successful years of \"Bewitched\"... This show had a definite impact on my childhood!! The premise being: This is your typical All-American housewife, except, this woman happens to be a witch!! Envision if you will, a house wife who can zap up this and twitch up that.. Basically conjure up anything your little heart desires with just the twitch of her nose!! Now enters the myriad of upper middle class complications!! I sort of identified with the Stevens household!! My opinion of it was that you could not get too much more Republican than this.. Especially some of the furniture, and the executive potpourri of golf, business, and drinking!! Sammantha\u0027s magic was not geared at just whipping up expensive accoutrement that your typical upscale white collar guinea pig cannot afford, rather, it was about evening the score on what matters and how people should actually behave!! Relative\u0027s of Sammantha\u0027s use to literally pop in all the time... Endora (Agnes Moorehead) the mother, used her powerful sorcerer\u0027s chicanery to make the banal life with a mortal husband (Darrin) more interesting!! To her, boredom was the ultimate felony!! I thought both Darrins were really well cast (Dick York and Dick Seargant)... Tabitha was the little witch and the daughter, and Adam was the mortal and the son!! The onslaught of guest stars were endless, including Richard Dreyfuss, and Raquel Welch!!... I thought \"Bewitched\" was was of the better shows in the history of television... I was not too crazy about the writing though.. When it premiered, it was considered one the most lewd and suggestive shows ever to be put on the airwaves... By today\u0027s standards that seems ridiculous, at the same time, when I heard this, I realized what they were saying in that this show illustrated numerous insinuations of attempted infidelity with one lecherous curmudgeon after the next!! These alcohol induced endeavors were relatively transparent!!.. Samntha had to be the disciplined one who quelled these charades, usually with her witchcraft!! In 1971, \"Bewitched\" ratings began to plummet, finally, programming directors at ABC basically killed it by putting it up against the enormously popular \"All in the Family\" on Saturday nights!! All good things must come to an end. including a television show which epitomized the idealism of the imaginative honey pot \"Bewitched\"... Part of my childhood, a very good part of my childhood.. I think that that is why the latest movie of \"Bewitched was so popular too!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
