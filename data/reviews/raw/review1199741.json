The comedy sometimes can be said stupid and the singing, if you like the three stooges you\u0027ll like this. The songs are great, the singing is great and how they use them even better. The supporting characters are cross between the riddler and barney. The plot is not the greatest but the acting can cover for that.I remember when this came out the reviewers said that this movie was bad. There a lot of movies that the power of the people reign supreme. My friends and I think this is a new cult classic.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
