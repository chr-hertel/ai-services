That said, Whedon rips through the exposition in the first five minutes with some skillful visual trickery and editing that should leave fans satisfied and newcomers comfortable.\n\nThen there is action, bucket-loads of it. And tears, and laughter, and absolutely brown-pant scary moments. This film has it all, but what it has at its centre is the emotions of the characters, not vast amounts of special effects. I won\u0027t spoil the plot, but it does centre on River and her psychic abilities. That said, everyone of the nine initial characters of the TV incarnation Firefly receives adequate screen time, save perhaps for Book and Inara. The actors are on fine form, notably Summer Glau and Nathan Fillion, and Alan Tudyk\u0027s comedy timing is the best I have seen. \n\nThe special effects are amazing, and I\u0027m not just talking CGI. I was one of the few who complained that the opening sequence of Episode 3 was too static. Here, when Serenity is in a firefight, we are caught up in the thick of it. The CG blurs, zooms, pans,twists, sometimes missing the action - just as it did on the show - but it works better on the cinema screen - you feel immediately involved in what is happening. The make-up artists jobs on the scary-as-hell Reavers is fine as well. \n\nUltimately though, the success of this film will lie on the writing of Joss Whedon, and it is very well conceived idea, both on page and on screen. I have to wait three months before I see it again, and I already want a sequel. \n\nThis is one ship I hope keeps on flying.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
