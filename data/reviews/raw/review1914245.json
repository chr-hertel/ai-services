This is the epic story Tim Burton set out to create 19 years and while he did a good job, he came nowhere near matching this film.\n\nWith \u0027Batman Begins\u0027 establishing the legend of Batman, TDK goes all out with Batman\u0027s war against evil. Christian Bale reprises his role as billionaire playboy and socialite Bruce Wayne, who is secretly the Batman, Gotham City\u0027s masked vigilante. Forming an uneasy alliance with James Gordon(played by Gary Oldman), one of Gotham\u0027s few honest police officers, and the new DA Harvey Dent(Aaron Eckhart), the Batman is determined to bring down the remains of Gotham\u0027s Mob. Unfortunately for him, the Mob has made a deal with the Joker, a psychopathic killer to rid the city of Batman. The Joker is a conscience-less killer with no motivations beyond chaos, who embarks on a crusade against Gotham\u0027s avenger. With innocents dying, and people close to him being threatened, Batman must face of against the man who is destined to be his greatest adversary ever, while struggling over the question of whether is masked crusade is truly what the city needs. Does it deserve a open and honest hero with a face, a \u0027White Knight\u0027 like Harvey Dent? Or does it deserve him, the Dark Knight?\n\nAlso appearing in this movie is Maggie Gyenhall as Rachel Dawes, Bruce\u0027s childhood friend and former love interest; Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce\u0027s faithful butler; and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, CEO of Wayne Enterprise, who supplies Batman with new advanced technologies to aid him in his war against crime.\n\nWith such a talented cast playing their parts to perfection, the action and effects which embellish the script and elevate it to epic proportions, and of course, the underlying themes and motivations of the characters brilliantly displayed, it comes as no surprise that this film is truly a masterpiece!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
