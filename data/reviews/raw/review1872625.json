Though entirely filled with established stars (and soon-to-bes), \"Midway\" does a great job of retelling the important U.S. defeat of Japan on the Pacific in 1942. Flip-flopping between the Japanese and the Americans, we watch code breaking, fact checking, logical guesswork, chess-gaming, and just plain good and bad luck at work during a crucial, everything-is-at-stake moment in WWII history. What is especially gratifying is the respect given to the details and truth, as well as the use of much original battle footage. The war was 30 years over at the release of this film, but those who survived were there to see it was done right." }
