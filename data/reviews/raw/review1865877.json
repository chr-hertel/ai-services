This is a pretty good little film that moves along very quickly and contains some good dialogue and performances. I was really impressed with the two women in the film played by Anne Collette and Nicole Berger. Both women turn in strong performances and best of all is that they make both characters very memorable. Jean-Claude Brialy also does a fine job in his role. I really don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything too overly special about the film and it really doesn\u0027t even look or feel like the work of Godard but for what it is the film is worth viewing." }
