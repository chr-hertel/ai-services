Seeing this film at HBO Comedy Fest, I did not understand how these guys did not get served with a lawsuit. Probably knowing a thing or two about law, they jumped through as many loopholes as they could to use Drew Barrymore\u0027s image. \n\nAnother issue I had with it was the fact that this film not only uses Barrymore but makes her an object to be desired. Is Barrymore a thing to be coveted? Does it not matter to this schlub that she actually has a boyfriend? \n\nIf anyone needed a gimmick it was them. And they used it. But judgig that, after the fests, it only lasted a weekend in already limited release, the gimmick does not work on audiences.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
