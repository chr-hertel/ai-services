It is not really worth your time unless someone pays you to watch it. It is as predictable as it is lame. The ending is so irritating that it made me want to scream! Save yourself the trouble and avoid it at all costs.\n\nI will give it some credit in that it has a few good moments, but these good moments are overshadowed by the relatively lame plot and uninspired ending.\n\nThe acting is okay; and not as bad as some people have said; but overall the movie just isn\u0027t written that well and therefore it falls short. Not much of a story leads to not much of a movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
