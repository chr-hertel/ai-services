Still, this is notable for being the first script with an idea and script entirely by Chris Boucher who would fast become a more important creative force for this series than Terry Nation, whose involvement became less and less frequent towards the end of the series. In many ways this episode is a fresh start for \"Blake\u0027s 7\".\n\nThe concept for the episode is fairly solid, with Blake attempting to buy the services of the Terra Nostra organized crime syndicate as part of his struggle against the Federation. When his first attempt fails he decides to go after the drug-like substance (and the Terra Nostra\u0027s main source of income) \u0027shadow\u0027 for leverage. Quite a thinly-veiled real life allegory but pulled off fairly well in the script by Boucher, whose clever dialogue and general strength in plotting is evident here.\n\nA good start for an important creative force in the future of \"Blake\u0027s 7\". Although a weakness according to some I find the series\u0027 ability to jump from pulpy sci-fi to allegorical drama to straightforward action/adventure refreshing when compared to the dreary and awfully predictable nature of most television series.\n\n8/10" }
