Having seen most of them, I would say this must surely be the jewel in the AFT crown. Unlike the Pinter directed \"Butley\" it has grown rather than diminished by the years. \n\nThis is one of those film plays (Glengarry Glen Ross may be another) does commit the crime of doing the play so well that it pretty much makes further productions useless. The film of \"The Caretaker\" done some years earlier is also very strong.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
