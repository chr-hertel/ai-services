It went something like this One morning the Lord, Shewoke up to say, \"I feel like i want to be creative today. So by the virtue of the power I invested in me I make the heaven, the earth and the deep blue sea.\" Things swam by, walked, fly-ed,creep ed and crawled. \"Now I\u0027d better make someone to name it all\". Yes a human was needed in the neighborhood. So the Lord made woman and it was good. She said \"the garden of eden is no place to be alone\". So from the rib of the Madam came Adam full grown. As time went by this groom and bride followed the instructions and multiplied. He cooked. She worked.............\n\nThat\u0027s all I can remember. Can anyone help me find the rest of the words or maybe even the song itself? email me", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
