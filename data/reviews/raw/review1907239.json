It is a sincere, severe and enthralling discussion of what constitutes the right and the wrong, the good and the bad, the true and the false. And it does so with such strength and style. \n\nDirector Stefan Ruzowitsky draws spectators into a darkly iniquitous world that and confronts us (effectively) with the detainees\u0027 differing inner and outer conflicts, feelings and exertions. Many of the grief-stricken men are unable to accept the circumstances and conditions they have been presented with while their families, friends and fellow Jews continue to suffer in the ghettos and concentration camps of Auschwitz and beyond. Especially Loszek (Lenn Kudrjawizki) and Burger (August Diehl) who both struggle in finding reasons for living a life of such fraudulent injustice, the latter: persistent in his refusal to aid the enemy in their bid to wage the war despite overwhelming pressure from the rest of the counterfeiting squad intent on day-to-day survival in the cornered-off camp. Is their integrity inferior to their existence? Their counterfeiting forgery of their own moral and religious principles? Their lives worth living? These are, in essence, the primary questions that play on the minds of Salomon, the counterfeiters and, indeed, us as we\u0027re forced to endure their torments both up close and personal.\n\nInviting numerous comparisons to Shindler\u0027s List and The Pianist, The Counterfeiters could well be a masterpiece. It\u0027s terrific, outstanding and as touching as it is important. Possibly the finest film to emerge from European cinema since The Lives of Others. Watch it, then watch it again, as Ruzowitsky\u0027s telling tour de force is far afield from synthetic. Inches from perfection.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
