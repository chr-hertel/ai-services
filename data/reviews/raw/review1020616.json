Produced by local entrepreneur Phillip Emmanuel and taking full advantage of the tax concessions of the time (the infamous 10BA, much rorted here in Oz by unscrupulous \u0027film makers\u0027) REBEL tries very hard to en-ter-tain you whilst clobbering you with 80s kitch 40s style. Most everything in the film is a garish pink or red, with tin icon decor of Sydney and local actors yelling their lines at each other through very broad slang. Matt Dillon plays a soldier AWOL who hides out in Debbie\u0027s apartment and apparently falls in love with her. It is all sort of all right. In 1982 a better musical was produced here called STAR STRUCK and REBEL supplants all the OZ kitchery into a 1943 period harborside wharehouse nightclub and adds raucous musical numbers. Only one is really good; most are not. Today it is a curiosity of an attempt at having US stars in Oz pix for overseas sales possibilities. Many films were cast like this like THE MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER with - believe it or not - Kirk Douglas (!!!!) and Rebel is in this mould. Maybe that should be mold. Dillan looks good, pouts, kisses Debbie and ultimately goes home. It was a reasonable success in its day...but now...all a bit squirm inducing. It would be interesting to see if it is still on Dillon\u0027s resume. I think at the time he might have had more fun in real local nightclubs than on the set of REBEL.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
