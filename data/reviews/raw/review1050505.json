What I first noticed was that the characters and dialogue were realistic. I could imagine meeting these people - it wasn\u0027t contrived and it wasn\u0027t larger than life. I thought it was engaging and well done, and more challenging and honest than most stuff on TV. The actors really brought the characters to life and made their interactions believable. The pace was somewhat slow at times, but for me at least, the suspense was always there and it never felt dull. It\u0027s not the type of movie I\u0027d like to re-watch over and over again, but it was a pleasant way to spend an evening.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
