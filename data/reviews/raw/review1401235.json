The plot delivery is somewhere between \"Doc Hollywood\" and \"To Wong Foo...\", reconstructed for kids in the 6 - 10 years old range.\n\nThe best parts are the Pixar components, those being the effortlessly fastidious attention to detail, and the \u0027camera\u0027 movement. This is not a gimmick, but part of the visual storytelling. \n\nConsider the way this movie handles memories: when Wilson\u0027s \"car\" remembers his trip through the turns on Rt. 66, the memory is shown from the car\u0027s-eye perspective, not as we first saw it from our 3rd person perspective. This is a clever effect, the best of its type I\u0027ve seen since the BASE jump in \"To Live and Die in LA\". And consider that the entire movie is a \u0027memory\u0027 too (a computer program), and let that bake your noodle for a while.\n\nThe (slightly) bad - there\u0027s a bit too much \u0027Disney\u0027 in this, meaning the tendency toward saccharine characters, pop-culture innuendo and reliance on audience testing...smart movies make comments about movies, not usually about cultural trivia. You can see the \u0027Pixar\u0027 forces fighting back in the end title sequences where the Pixar back catalogue is reimagined as the Cars would see them, and those \u0027movies\u0027 are framed within a \u0027drive-in movie\u0027.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
