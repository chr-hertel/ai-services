Well, him and Jason Bateman made the movie. In this movie, a guy (Zach Braff) is continually getting fired from his job, so he decides to move town and work for his wife\u0027s (Amanda Peet) father (Charles Grodin) at his ad agency. Here, he meets an ex of his wife\u0027s (Played by Jason Bateman) who try to make his life a living hell. The film is extremely funny and light and a good addition to the cringe type of comedy that Zach Braff has done on Scrubs. The acting performances were enough to keep me watching as they were honestly so dead on portraying what they were meant to. Now, don\u0027t get me wrong, this will not win ANY Oscars but anybody with a sense of humour or somebody who is a big fan of Zach Braff (I am both) will LOVE this movie. I rate this film 72% although that is compared to other movies coming out it would usually be about a 65.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
