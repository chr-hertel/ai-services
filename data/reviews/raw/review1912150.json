Damon Lindelof, normally capable of writing scripts with real flow, penned \"Homecoming\", an episode with a hopelessly boring and completely pointless Charlie flashback, and an involving if flawed mythology-centric island story involving Ethan and Scott (or is that Steve?).\n\n\"Homecoming\" is one of the episodes I tend to avoid watching too many times. It has several iconic scenes that one remembers so well, but virtually everything outside those iconic scenes is mediocre. Charlie\u0027s flashback does nothing but reiterate that he\u0027s struggling with addiction, and it is horrifically poorly-written by Lindelof, easily the worst work I\u0027ve seen from him on this show.\n\nThe on-island events with Ethan\u0027s threats and Claire\u0027s return are fairly enjoyable, but hugely inconsistent, with some of the dialogue frankly making me cringe. The episode is directed terribly by Kevin Hooks, continuing the severe lack of visual quality in the first season of \"Lost\", where three out of the fifteen episodes thus far have been notably well-directed.\n\n6/10" }
