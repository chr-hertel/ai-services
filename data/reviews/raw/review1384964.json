It certainly doesn\u0027t seem to take *itself* seriously, which helps me overlook its dated plot, \"cutesy\" narrative and crypto-exploitation themes. By this I mean that this is the kind of film that leers at its scantily clad female characters even as it supposedly celebrates their spunk and grit. It\u0027s as if Ed Wood decided to make a family film for Mom and Dad to enjoy along with the kids.\n\nBut I am OK with that.\n\nObvious care and effort went into the sets and the special effects, at least considering the \"B movie\" nature of the material. The women are cute and the men are personable and virile...although I found it curious that the \"hero\" of the movie had less muscle mass than a 14 year old girl; that the monster who attacks the clans at the climax of the film looks like a stop-motion rubber chicken with a pteranondon crest taped on; that the men didn\u0027t figure out the part where they picked up rocks and threw them back at the women, but managed to invent fire and cooking...etc. etc.If you are looking for logic, consistency or real \u0027weight\u0027 in your adventure story, you won\u0027t find it here.\n\nThis was probably a lot of fun for a date movie in the local Bijou when it was released in 1950. But it\u0027s hard to imagine anyone watching \"Prehistoric Women\" for anything other than camp or nostalgic value these days. Still a decent effort for what it was.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
