It ain\u0027t great but it does deliver some back woods fun, with a low budget charm and terrific swamp locations. I\u0027d say the acting is pretty good, especially the redneck family. The film\u0027s biggest failing is having Claudia Jennings the star and then mess her all up and never get her clothes off! The nudity comes courtesy of Janit Baldwin and she never looked better than she does here, although her outfits and hair style are completely out of place in the swamps. Also some comments mention rape, well, there is an attempted rape that never gets started before it is halted. This does result in a very unpleasant sequence, but no one gets shot in the stomach ( it\u0027s nastier than that ). While the movie has it\u0027s flaws ( the screenplay, Jenning\u0027s Cajun accent ) it is solid drive in style fun with an authentic, mud strewn setting and crazy, inbred southern rednecks fighting for their lives against an enraged, revenge seeking woman." }
