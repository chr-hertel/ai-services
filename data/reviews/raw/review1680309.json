But the technology used for it was awesome. Its a movie of its kind. I don\u0027t agree with the comments of some saying it is not for international audience. Rajinikanth has a huge fan base in some east Asian countries, especially in Japan. In western countries these kind of movie formula may be strange, but still this movie was listed in UK top 10 listings. Thus it has its own fan base. You like it... watch it or just leave it. Don\u0027t comment saying it is not fit to be a movie to screen outside India. It has its own charm. When western heroes like Arnold act as larger than life heroes in their late 50\u0027s, why not Rajini? He still has a good charm loved by so many not only in India, outside too.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
