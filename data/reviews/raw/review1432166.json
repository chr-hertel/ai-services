To this day, through all of the anime films/series I\u0027ve seen, this still reigns as the greatest. No anime fan will be disappointed with this film, even those who aren\u0027t fans of the genre should enjoy this flick. It is sad that this film didn\u0027t get very much exposure in the States, as it easily could have been subject to awards. A great example of a film students interperetive dream; Trying to develop a correlation between all of the shorts (outside of their all contain robots), pulling some greater meaning from the movie. Yea, it\u0027s one of those types of movie, that appears to be on a higher philosophical level than just your average entertainment.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
