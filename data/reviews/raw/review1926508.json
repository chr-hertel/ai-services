In other words William, who is a peasant becomes a knight. Being stuck in a low social class this is unacceptable. But with courage and heart anything is possible! not to mention the phony document that claims that William is in the correct social class to be a knight... -I\u0027m sitting there as my mother is complaining about tonight\u0027s movie selection. \"Ugghh...this look\u0027s so terrible, it\u0027s only a matter of time before Adam Sandler shows up\". Soon enough \"Queen\" starts and my mother stops her rant. The first half of the film, entertaining as is be is fine and all, but is not nearly as good as the second half. The first half has some good humor, music, and action, but it\u0027s not until the halfway through the film that I invest a good chunk of my feelings in the characters, just feels a little heartless. The second half delves a little bit into both William\u0027s love interest story and also his past. This improves the story, because you know why he has the desire and motivation to be a knight. The other characters are funny and likable as you get to know them. You admire them for their loyalty and friendship to William. -The other thing thats fun about this movie is the music. The film contains classic songs from \"AC DC\", \"Queen\", amongst other classic rock bands. These songs give the film a special tone and energy. It makes the movie feel like a classic story with a modern attitude. -Overall I really liked \"A Knight\u0027s Tale\". If you haven\u0027t already seen it and like films such as \"The Princess Bride\" and \"Stardust\" then this is the movie for you. Its not a classic or anything, but has a strange ratio of humor, action/adventure, and drama that makes for a good film. Definitely pick it up, I might even go as far as recommending to buy it on DVD. B", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
