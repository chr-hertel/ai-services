However, it does lose steam towards the end  Arkin\u0027s absence is certainly felt here and much of the contest sequence actually falls flat; therefore, for all the accolades that have been bestowed upon it, I would have been very surprised had it won the Best Picture Oscar!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
