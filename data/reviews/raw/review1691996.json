But Michelle Yeoh creates a memorable and competent impression while maintaining a masterful grace and precision that will blow your mind.\n\nMichelle Yeoh has the posture and grace of Bruce Lee, now if only they had done a movie together... now that would be something, like Salvador Dali\u0027s short animation collaboration with Walt Disney, what a treat that would be.* I saw this movie years ago and finally discovered it again after long searching and am I glad I did rediscover this little gem.\n\nThis movie truly takes me back in time to a simpler time, like finding a diamond in between the millions of grains of sand on the endlessness of beach.\n\nMuch of the acting is really silly, but that\u0027s just the way these movies were back then. The martial arts are terrific, the sex appeal is palpable, Tofu is gorgeous, drop dead, and the story is very enjoyable.\n\n*Dali and Disney started a project in 1946 but it was never finished in their lifetimes, recently completed in 2003, many of us are long awaiting a DVD release slated for 2004, and still waiting in 2007.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
