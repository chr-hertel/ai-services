Many scenes were actually just as I had imagined them while reading the books.\n\nThe photography is breathtaking and the sets amazing. According to scholars of fourteenth century Norway, the attention to detail in depicting every day life and customs is very authentic.\n\nThe costumes are beautiful and the actors, without exception, perfect for the parts. We were riveted!\n\nBuy the DVD with the uncut version and extras. Definitely worthwhile watching more than once... or twice... or thrice....!!!\n\nI hope Liv Ullmann will film the other two books as well. And soon!\n\nDon\u0027t miss this remarkable movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
