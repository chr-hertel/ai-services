We\u0027d go to the website and send them fake recipes (like cookies, but we\u0027d list dirty socks and thumbtacks in the ingredient list) and make up some retarded story off the top of our heads just for fun and email them, and send hate mail because our tasty recipes and wonderful stories weren\u0027t being put on the air. we decided that \"matt\" and \"kailey\" were in love and that \"garret\" was jealous and we made this book about it and sent it to them. after that, we thought it would be funny to make a book about what we thought about all the characters, but we lost interest in that one. yeah we were pretty dumb, but we were also like 7, 10, and 12. i\u0027m sure my sister would have enjoyed the show, but didn\u0027t want to admit it as my brother and i laughed at it!" }
