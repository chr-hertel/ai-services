As such, when I noticed this movie at the local rental hut I decided to give it a watch.\n\nUnfortunately I simply didn\u0027t like the movie. It came off as forced and the story was predictable and while the premise is kind of cute overall it felt way too stretched out. The actors do be themselves and they put out okay performances. But, with predictable story and plot it just didn\u0027t do it for me. It had potential, but as I say, sometimes too many A-lists don\u0027t provide a good movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
