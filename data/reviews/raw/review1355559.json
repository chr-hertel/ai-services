This show was underrated and was taken off the air prematurely. CBS seemed not to be able to place it in the right time slot. The episode of the deceased showing up in the back row of his own funeral was one of the most enjoyable episodes of ANY TV show that I can remember. If only....If only it was brought back in syndication.\n\nTim Reid and Daphne M. Reid produced such a wonderful show, it calls to your attention that well written, sophisticated, intelligent television programs many times do not receive the praise and viewing slot that is necessary to make it a mega hit." }
