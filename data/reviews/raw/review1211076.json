I was only mildly interested in watching, but it gripped me from the start and held my attention to the end. You don\u0027t need to know the original text to enjoy the quick comedic dialogue and the story lines of deceit and love are relevant in any period of history. This adaption puts the characters in a television studio of Wessex Tonight with Beatrice and Benedick as the presenters, Hero as a weather girl and Claudio as a reporter. The relationship of B \u0026 B was explored and explained well with both actors giving excellent performances. Looking forward to sitting in next Monday evening for the next helping of Will\u0027s tales.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
