Running into the street in a frenzied state, she gets hit by a car. While she\u0027s knocked out the helpful man molests her, putting the running tally to 3.. At first she\u0027s angry at him, but then they begin to fall in love. While this was better then the forth and worst of the series, it was still nowhere near the first three. Which makes me strongly feel that Angel Guts would have been a fondly remembered trilogy, if only they left it at that.\n\nMy Grade: C \n\nDVD Extras: Commentary by Jasper Sharp; Bio/Filmographies; a 32 and a half minute interview with Takashi Ishii; Original Sleeve art; and Trailers for this and 4 other Angel Guts Films (High School Co Ed, Red Classroom, Nami, \u0026 Red Porno) all available in Artsmagik\u0027s Box-set, but for some reason the 6th film \"Angel Guts: Red Flash\" is not in the set", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
