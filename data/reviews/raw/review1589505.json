Night Shyamalan has produced a decent film in The Village. It is interesting how he has used the village and its people as a metaphor to show how fear can keep us imprisoned, contained and controlled. It takes a rebellious mind to break free. It is also striking to see that people could theoretically be contained within a time period. We see the village living in medi-evil times while a few short kilometers away the rest of the world lives in the 21st century. It is an intriguing film to watch and attempts reasonably to get the audience to feel the fear of the villagers. It is a worthwhile film for those who like twists and turns. M. Night Shyamalan has become somewhat of an Alfred Hitchcock with his cameo appearances, and with films like The Sixth Sense he is not too far off.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
