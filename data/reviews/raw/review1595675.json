Of course, Jules Verne wrote the novel, so we can\u0027t totally blame the movie for the portrayals. So if we can get past these depictions, it\u0027s a perfectly entertaining experience. The movie portrays English scientist Cedric Hardwicke inventing a balloon-powered dirigible and having to fly to West Africa to stop slave traders (as if the British weren\u0027t doing creepy things in their own colonies?). He brings along military man Richard Haydn, young Canadian guy Fabian, and accident-prone American reporter Red Buttons. Through numerous stops, they pick up freed slave Barbara Luna, slave trader Peter Lorre, American teacher Barbara Eden, and chimpanzee Chester.\n\nThe characters come across as a real mixture. Most of the cast members do a good job, but Fabian seems out of place, Red Buttons\u0027s role just seems silly, and Barbara Luna has little more than her looks (I\u0027ve never read the novel, so I can\u0027t comment on possible changes). In almost any other movie, this combo would drag the whole thing down significantly, but not here; if anything, it makes the picture more entertaining. Even if there\u0027s a lot of continuity errors and such things, it\u0027s impossible not to have fun while watching \"FWIAB\". Also starring Herbert Marshall, Billy Gilbert, Henry Daniell and Mike Mazurki (Gilbert and Daniell previously co-starred in \"The Great Dictator\").\n\nOne more thing. Among the DVD\u0027s special features is footage from the movie\u0027s debut in Denver. One of the best things about this footage is that we get to see Barbara Eden in a shell dress! Such a sight, in my opinion, means that there is a God! Aside from her Jeannie outfit, a shell dress is the only thing that I can imagine Barbara Eden wearing. If these sorts of thoughts make me a pervert, then I\u0027m proud to be one.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
