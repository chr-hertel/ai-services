Despite the presence of two great stars in Glenn Ford (3:10 from Yuma) and William Holden (Wild Bunch/Stalag 17) the film is far from a classic. It starts out with great potential as a battle fatigued Colonel Owen Devereaux played by Ford massacres a 100 troop Confederate party (they have plainly raised their white flag)just as the Civil War ends. Captain Del Stewart played by Holden - looking more the Hollywood golden boy than a war weary officer, immediately deduces that Ford has massacred the troop. He is a loyal long time friend and keeps his powder (and makeup) dry. After being mustered out (with little time to ketchup with their mutual girlfriend) Ford gets appointed a Federal Judge ( Owen to the lack of any sanity clause in his commission) and Holden is named US Marshal. The first trial he presides over is one of the film\u0027s better scenes and shows how following the law doesn\u0027t always result in justice.\n\nFord continues to slip deeper into insanity. He\u0027s a hangin judge you don\u0027t want to hang with. So what is the film\u0027s point? There was no hint of is illness to anyone but Holden before his high appointment so I\u0027m lost as to the film\u0027s message. Power can corrupt, but Ford is not corrupt; the war has simply driven him mad. He must kill anyone who threatens him. He is not portrayed as a tragic figure.\n\nLook for Edgar Buchanan on leave from the Shadyrest playing the town doc and Ford\u0027s uncle. Perhaps a six month tour of Petticoat Junction would have been all Ford needed. I\u0027ve enjoyed Holden in lots of flicks, but the guy\u0027s just too handsome and cleancut to be one day ex-military. He reminds me of the US interim provost in Iraq- Paul Bremer . The guy\u0027s clothes, beard and hair were always perfect while Iraq burned", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
