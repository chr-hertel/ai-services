There is also a review of the Sunday newspapers with guests.\n\nMost of the guests Marr interviews are politicians but actors and singers also guest.\n\nSunday AM is usually screened on BBC1 between 9 and 10 am and each show lasts one hour.\n\nThis has jazz type theme music, quite unusual for this type of show." }
