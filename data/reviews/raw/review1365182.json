Please! I think the appropriate genre would be a D grade Gory murderous movie. ******* I don\u0027t even know where to begin. I read some reviews on IMDb and finally decided to rent it. Now I hope I\u0027d rented \"The Ring\" instead. This is a bloody, vulgar presentation of something that the director wants to call a story. I don\u0027t care if it\u0027s based on true events. I switched it off when there were about 45 minutes left. As the guy with the knife started to chop off fingers, I thought I\u0027d seen enough of this stupidity.\n\nIt slightly reminded me of \"Wrong Turn\", which on the other hand had some really good actors and fast paced story. This one is a D grade movie with nothing to scare you. It will only make you sick. Jus avoid at all costs and find something better to do. Too bad I won\u0027t get back the hour I wasted on this crap.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
