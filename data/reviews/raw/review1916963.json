The Dark Knight is the best interpretation since Burton\u0027s films (or some might argue since Batman:The Animated Series.It\u0027s a fantastic film which succeeds in impressing but if you step back \u0026 think for 2 seconds, it\u0027s not perfect, still has many flaws but is still the best blockbuster in years.\n\nI just have to get it out of my system, Batman Begins sucked on a huge level for me, poor \u0026 underused villains, some miscasting, a long \u0026 very boring first half, \u0026 not enough Batman. The Dark Knight succeeds in all these areas this time the parallel opposite to BB villains, the Joker is both terrifying \u0026 unbelievably insane, there are moments when he shows his insanity, the cinema find it funny I didn\u0027t...half the time anyway, I saw a deranged psychopath with no moral compass. Harvey Dent, I don\u0027t care what people say but for me the films belongs to Harvey, it stayed true to his comic counterpart, actually it didn\u0027t but character wise it does stay very true to the source material, Aaron Eckhart puts in an extremely memorable performance (as did Ledger) as Harvey/Two Face.\n\nShould I talk more about the good like the awesomely cool chase sequence or the occasional glimpse of a great musical score which ends up being a tad OTT but still great, nope I\u0027m gonna talk about the negative stuff. The Dark Knight is not the truest version of Batman, the Joker wears makeup, Dent\u0027s transformation into Two-Face has completely been changed, stupid Rachael is still in it, \u0026 the convenient set ups are bloody annoying. All these things are Nolan\u0027s fault, why cause he wants his vision set in the real world, excuse me I\u0027m never seen the Batman comics ever try to be realistic, in TDK you feel he\u0027s taking this too far \u0026 that in the next film it will get ridiculous, wouldn\u0027t be surprised if the Riddler was turned into some super hacker.\n\nNice to see how conveniently he can get a new suit in such short time (only the later campy Batman films were guilty of this) or just so happens to have a Bat-Pod come out from nowhere, which still looks ridiculous. Rachael is now played by a different actress (Maggie) who I\u0027m a fan of which made her character that more interesting than Cruise\u0027s wife from BB but still they could of used one of the many women in Bruce\u0027s life from the comics (\u0026 no not Vicki Vale). I have a slight problem with two aspects of Nolan\u0027s films which are related...Bruce Wayne, Bale is not playing Bruce he\u0027s playing Batman all the time, not literally \u0026 yeah I know Batman\u0027s mask is Bruce, there is no depth to Bruce\u0027s character, by depth I mean in the film it wants to be, but compared to any other blockbuster its PERFECT. You feel no emotional connection to the things which affect Bruce\u0027s life, you see it affect Batman but not Bruce, if you get what I\u0027m saying. And the second thing related to this is Bale, he plays Batman not Bruce, when\u0027s he\u0027s Bruce he never shows the depth of acting a actor should for playing this deeply scarred torn character, look at Keaton in the original films, his face did half the acting while he was Bruce \u0026 he showed the exact version of Bruce I have in my head, a tortured soul who just doesn\u0027t fit in \u0026 not Bale pretending to be this ass of a playboy isn\u0027t quite the same thing. Doesn\u0027t help when the only scene I felt anything for Bruce was when he was sulking in the chair, which was both brief \u0026 required almost zero acting skills mostly cause the camera wasn\u0027t focusing on Bruce but more on Alfred. I only connected to Gordon \u0026 Harvey Dent, but both of the actors who play them are two of my favourite actors. Minus those two I just felt emotional connection to the characters, yeah the Joker does things which cause people to get angry \u0026 upset but the film distanced itself from showing any emotional depth other than a few scenes most of which are Harvey/Gordon related.\n\nThis is much more I can criticize especially being a serious Batman fan but I won\u0027t go into that since it will give big spoilers away \u0026 this review is getting long . How about some positive closing comments (two paragraphs I mean) .\n\nThe Dark Knight is by no means a bad film nor an OK film nor a good film...no it\u0027s a fantastic film which just about meets my expectations. I still can\u0027t get over Bale\u0027s voice as Batman (deep voice) or some of the aspects of the villains but it makes up for it with a very well thought out script, occasional snippets of unique \u0026 original dialogue (all by the Joker \u0026 Dent), some much improved action sequences over BB, \u0026 a fitting but not entirely satisfying fan-boy ending but is well done nonetheless.\n\nBut here\u0027s the thing it draws more on the detective aspect of Batman but oh shock it really isn\u0027t, Batman does almost zero detective work honestly. And the big thing is it\u0027s become a film...not a superhero film, Nolan has sucked everything out of Batman making it this realistic story of an outcast, which is fine, hell even great...no fantastic but it\u0027s not an accurate version of BATMAN that\u0027s why I give it a 9/10 (so close to giving it a 9.9/10) I\u0027ve thought about all night \u0026 I just can\u0027t be like everybody else \u0026 give it a perfect 10 just cause it was fantastic, I just don\u0027t think it quite earned a perfect 10.\n\nI still like Batman Returns \u0026 \u002789 more, I believe Burton captured Batman \u0026 Bruce Wayne better than Nolan ever will.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
