Chapelle must feel guilty about his mainly white audience because he worked hard on making this presentation relatively inaccessible to them. THere is a lot of wandering dull dialog about nothing with various non-interesting rap people. A joke might happen once every 20 min and I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a single entire song on the whole damn thing. This is unfocused and self indulgent and not even the slightest bit interesting, funny or entertaining or watchable. BTW- I LOVE CHAPELLE SHOW- BUT THIS IS TOTAL JUNK.\n\nIF this video made Dave quit after he watched it- THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE. He has now joined OJ Simpson scouring the golf courses of America to search for the real killer.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2" } }
