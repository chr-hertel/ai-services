He transforms Jose from a violent gang-banger into a decent man. His words really sounded like a modern day Jesus. It made me really think of how many times we have help from above and we do not even realize it. To see a person so kind and so wise, using everyday language to influence the devious mind of a teenager was very refreshing. Later on when Jose is released from Jail, Jesus stays helping another gang member. It was then that I realized Jesus did not really exist, at least not as an official prisoner. That blew me away! I hope teenagers watch this story. It would teach them to change their ways in a very original way.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
