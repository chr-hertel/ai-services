However, by the time that the movie had ended, I realized that I had probably just seen, by far, the best crime/cop movie ever! \n\nThis had everything that I loved in crime movies (as well as the original series) but without the 80\u0027s sensitivity toward violence in movies \u0026 TV. In other words, this movie makes the 1980\u0027s Miami Vice look like the campy 1960\u0027s Batman, in comparison.\n\nFarrell \u0026 Fox, whom I am not big fans of, certainly changed my opinion of their talents (more so with Farrell as this is the first thing that I\u0027ve ever liked him in).\n\nTo touch on what else was great about the film I loved the music, the locations and the close-ups with the type of film used (some scenes were grainy, almost camcorder-ish, but this gave it a realistic, \"COPS\" kind of feel). The story was exceptional and my only complaint is that it should had been longer as there could have been more detail in the drug traffiking operations (guess I\u0027ll have to wait for a Director\u0027s cut DVD). Advertisements put the time at 2:26 but it definitely ends just under 2 hrs, so there is more story to be had somewhere, someplace.\n\nThe opening sequence is a non-traditional one with no opening credits at all after the Universal Globe logo and it starts in the middle of another case but, Crockett/Tubbs get interrupted from that due to an informant from a previous case and this informant basically sets up the case for the movie. What I am trying to explain is that they put you right smack in the middle of these under cover cops\u0027 lives and you live their lives for 2 hours. This is a sign of superb movie making when a director can accomplish the feeling of you actually being there and Michael Mann succeeds in this.\n\nAs far as talk of Academy Awards, not that they matter anyway, but I could definitely see a cinematography nod. However, this is just not the type of sappy crap that the Academy likes so I don\u0027t see a nomination for picture or screenplay. But that\u0027s a good thing.\n\nIn closing, I highly recommend this film for anyone with an interest in these types of stories. If you talk to people and they didn\u0027t like it, they just may not have appreciated the complexity of the story line or the artistic visuals of this film. This may, in fact be the type of movie that people have to see 2, 3 or 4 times to realize that this a quality film with a new \u0026 unique type of film style. Either way, it is certainly worth a few bucks to see this 2 hrs of living art.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
