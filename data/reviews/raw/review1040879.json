Good vibe. Great mood.", "reviewBody": "Low budget. Good vibe. Great mood. Funny, heartfelt and sincere. Convincing performances, especially by Alberto Rosas. Very good cast and crew work - good production quality for only $30.000. I\u0027d recommend it to everyone who liked \"The Broken Hearts Club\". The best thing about this movie is that it doesn\u0027t pretend to be anything else but itself - low budget film with witty and honest script, good cinematography and solid performances. In the interviews on DVD director says that before he made this movie he watched a lot of \"gay\" films where gay people were either coming out, or crazy maniacs, or dying some horrible death. Instead of it \"Gyspy Boys\" takes viewer on a very enjoyable ride with it\u0027s charming characters exploring everyday life problems anyone can relate to. P.S.: Also reminded me of sort of low budget \"Queer As Folk\".", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
