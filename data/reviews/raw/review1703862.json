That being said, the more one watches it, the easier it becomes to identify the factors that make this a classic, even if it\u0027s of the cult variety. For one, the movie never takes itself too seriously. Two, despite some of the jokes falling into the \"badoom-ching\" category, much of the humor is genuine, and one or two running themes are paid off quite well. Third, and most importantly, there are a handful of good performances in the movie; Sheen and Estevez are excellent together (not to mention their 80\u0027s style haircuts), as are their two \"rival\" trash men, played by Geoffrey Blake and Cameron Dye. Interestingly, the movie contains quite a few \"pairings\" of characters, if you will, with a duo of hired thugs and tandem of self-important bicycle cops beautifully adding to the humor. However, the finest performance in the film might come from Keith David, who plays the deranged and imbalanced veteran, Louis Fedders. All things considered, this is not cinematic genius personified. In fact, by today\u0027s standards, this is a garden variety comedy. However, neither of those statements diminish, in any way, my enjoyment of this film, and I fully recommend it to any fan of Sheen, or anyone who enjoys a good \"blue-collar\" comedy. So, in that vein, I salute you, Carl Taylor and James St. James!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
