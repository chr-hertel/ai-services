I decided to kill some time watching it, not expecting very much. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nI should identify that the movie has nothing to do with the Rolling Stones\u0027 song. Denzel Washington plays Matt Whitlock, a cop in a small Florida town. He\u0027s been having an affair with a certain Ann (Sanaa Lathan). Since she\u0027s dying of cancer, she\u0027s made him the beneficiary of her will. But when she and her husband die in a fire, all evidence points to Matt (you\u0027ll understand what I mean if you see the movie). So arises the quandary of how he\u0027s going to solve the case and clear his name before it\u0027s too late, especially given that his ex-wife Alex (Eva Mendes) is absolutely intent on solving the case.\n\nThe movie\u0027s real strength lies in the twists and turns that they throw in from time to time. I think that probably the coolest scene is the whole sequence in the police station about halfway through the movie; I would have never imagined any movie having a whole sequence like that! But I actually considered Matt\u0027s friend Chae (John Billingsley) to be the best character in the movie; I mean, some of those monologues were so great.\n\nAll in all, it\u0027s not any kind of masterpiece. But it\u0027s better than your average man-on-the-run-has-to-clear-himself story. And if I may say so, Eva Mendes looked mighty fine in some of those outfits!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
