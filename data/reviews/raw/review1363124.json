This was their 12th short subject together, released shortly after ALUM AND EVE in late 1932. They\u0027re door-to-door salesgirls who are unsuccessful selling to housewives, so they head downtown to sell to their husbands. Inside City Hall, they have several run-ins with a cranky judge and his bodyguard (frequent Three Stooges foils James Morton and Bud Jameson) and Charley Hall. A mediocre entry in the series, but there\u0027s some pretty good slapstick, particularly when Zasu (pronounced \"ZAY-SOO\"; most folks pronounce it incorrectly these days) gets tangled up in a ladder.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
