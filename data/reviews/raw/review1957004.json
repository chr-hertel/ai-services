Two responded by saying it was horrid and the other responded by saying it was incredible.\n\nI decided to disregard their views and see the film with an open mind. I loved City of God so I was going to like Blindness. Wrong. I despised it. I rarely use that word, despise, but in this situation it\u0027s logical. Whatever metaphor, parable, allegory that is supposed to be showed in the film is done in a lousy style. You can\u0027t sympathise with the characters, there\u0027s a lack of poetry, and a dearth of laudable acting. It was like watching a b-grade science fiction film made in the 1990s. At the end of the day I had to say that it tried to be something but ended up being nothing, nothing worth experiencing.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
