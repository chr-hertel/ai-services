And sometimes you feel you\u0027ll just melt away. So it was for me watching this brilliant film. Mick Jagger and the boys have traveled straight into history. It\u0027s as if they\u0027d got hold of something that\u0027s eluded us all and, for me at least, they\u0027ve left no doubt which band is the greatest, Beatles or Stones.\n\nI originally didn\u0027t want to sit through a long concert. But I was wrong. There\u0027s nothing dull or repetitious in this movie and, in fact, there are some surprises including a gem of a Keith Richard rendition and a revealing duet between Mick and Jack White. The film is like a compilation of a thousand lucky catches. Mick\u0027s energy, musicality and playfulness come through loud and clear, and I began to wonder just how influential this band\u0027s been over the years.\n\nAs a guy, I know I always wanted to take notice and listen whenever they came up on somebody\u0027s playlist. The Beatles always seemed to be a more acceptable choice, even when it was a Stones\u0027 song that kept going through my mind. But after all these years, I\u0027ve concluded that it was the Stones who had the stronger grasp on my generation\u0027s psyche. In some ways they seem more honest than the Beatles. Certainly they\u0027ve had more fun over the years. I just heard someone list iconic British things to include Big Ben and the Beatles. I winced because I realized, if I were British, it would have been the Stones I would have mentioned. There\u0027s something miraculous about them that I can\u0027t help admiring.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
