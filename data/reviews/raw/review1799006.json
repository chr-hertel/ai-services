I\u0027ve found, after watching it with many friends, that you enjoy it completely, or find it absolutely unbearable. Personally, i\u0027ve watched it dozens of times, and it never gets old. There is a great back story within the movie itself, and a lot of different things are finally explained. It\u0027s a rather short movie, at just shy of 90-minutes, but it\u0027s definitely a thrill ride.\n\nThe shape seems to be pretty brutal in this film, but the acting is still there with the way he walks, stalks and kills. There are a lot of neat little screen shots with Micheal appearing in the background, which adds more of a spooky element to the movie.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
