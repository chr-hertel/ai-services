Also the opening scene wasn\u0027t as breathtaking as with the first film, it could have been the scene with Captain Jack Sparrow after that. \n\nCaptain Jack Sparrow was awesome yet again and he was great when he visited Disneyland Paris a few weeks ago (I wasn\u0027t there though), Jack did a great impression of Johnny Depp!!\n\nHonestly, my expectations of this movie where so high it couldn\u0027t possibly live up to it although it came close. Pirates of the Caribbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl is one of my all-time favourite movies ever.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
