Give us a break.\n\nHenry Fonda was always one of my favorites but the character he portrays here is not too admirable. He forms a gigantic combined family, gets the wife pregnant and then takes off to the sea leaving the mother to deal with 18 kids and one more on the way.\n\nWhat a concept.\n\nThe remake of this movie with Dennis Quaid and Renee Russo is even worse. At least Lucy and Fonda were believable as a couple - though not as the parents of this brood.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
