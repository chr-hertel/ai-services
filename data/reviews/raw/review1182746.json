But now with sketch show comedies as comedy inc, skit house and big bite have really gone downhill. skit house and big bite both had only 1 or 2 good sketches but the rest was pathetic. Comedy inc was crap all together. I am glad skit house and big bite are not on anymore and have learnt their lesson that they are not funny.\n\nI decided to watch the late shift because nothing else was on. After 10 mins of it, i could not stand it anymore. The jokes are stupid, not funny at all, sometimes they go over the top on the jokes and do not know when to stop. it just drags on and on and on. Also really bad impersonations of celebrities.\n\nIf you want Aussie shows with funny humor, watch shows with shawn micallef in it.\n\nThe writers of these Aussie sketch shows should be fired or should learn from the British on how their sketch shows are really funny such as \"the sketch show\" \"deadringers\" \"the fast show\" etc." }
