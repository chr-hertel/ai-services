But, then, what could you expect out of Dubuque, Iowa, where nothing ever happened except the filming of F.I.S.T.? The early 1980s was a big beer-drinking time, though, with everyone partying and being an urban cowboy. This movie is basically a chance to see an early version of Bob Chandler\u0027s Bigfoot (before he was such a monster) and hear some country music. It\u0027s kind of a lighthearted, fun, partying romp. In fact, the writer very well could have written this movie in a state of intoxication. There\u0027s a scene where Robert Hays\u0027s character is supposed to throw a beer can into a trash can. Duh! Iowa beverage cans had a 5 cent deposit on them. This must have been written by someone from out of state!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5" } }
