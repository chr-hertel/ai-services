Caution advised.", "reviewBody": "Earnest, amateurish. I got about 6 minutes into it and had to give up. Classic moments from those ten mins: the closeup like an arrow on a goodbye note, followed closely by a \"perils of alcoholism\" zoom through a wineglass; the complete and fantastically impossible total mute of party noise when \"I wrote this for you\" guy leaves a door ajar, and the canned sentimental piano music which swells up in the scene which ensues.\n\nThat\u0027s where I bailed.\n\nOne wonders if this is a film-school project which garnered affection and support. At any rate, as of this writing there are no \u0027external reviews\u0027 for this release: that says something.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
