However, I feel that the sheer lack of explanation and the way it lets you understand it in your own way - or the way you succeed in preparing yourself to understand it - clears our usual presumptuous minds and makes room for greater self awareness, finally leading to extremely powerful catharsis. I won\u0027t go into details of the story. If you\u0027re still interested in finding your darkest self and come out laughing, are not afraid to not understand everything and don\u0027t mind occasional subtitles then you should see this movie. Hint: Stay in your seat for the credits, you won\u0027t regret it!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
