It is about Iwo Jima and the Japanese, about someone who doesn\u0027t want to be in a war and about a lot of people who get killed for no clear purpose. You should make your own mind up what this movie has with the here and now and maybe take into account that history general tends to be defined by the present. Eastwoord makes a statement without becoming overtly political, sentimental and without twisting the facts. \n\nThe movie Saving Private Ryan put forth the idea that war could have a purpose: liberating peoples from their oppressors; or: saving one life at the cost of others. The movie was a highly American centered sentimental movie, for it was about Americans and aimed at Americans.\n\nIf Saving Private Ryan poses the statement that war might have a purpose, Letters from Iwo Jima counters with the question: at what price? Letters is not of necessity a movie that tells us that war is futile, but it shows us what bloodshed war can cause and it also tells us that the guy on the other side of the hill isn\u0027t always a mindless killing machine. The movie is straightforward in this, without sentimentalism and as far as I can tell true to the facts. Of course Letters is remarkable because there is almost not role for the American soldier. The marines have that same vague role the Germans have in Saving Private Ryan. Yet despite this the movie is aimed at an American audience. Letters of Iwo Jima might therefore miss aspects of Japanese culture but this is because the purpose was not to be accurate in every detail. It was to show that there is another side to a tale. \n\nI think the movie it one of the better war movies made, despite the fact that is is somewhat to long in the middle.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
