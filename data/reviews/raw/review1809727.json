So I went on an auction site and bought the film. This is probably the worst film I have EVER seen. It makes you laugh when it really shouldn\u0027t. Terrible acting and terrible storyline. Plus he looks nothing like Michael Jackson?!\n\nI still recommend buying this film as its one of the funniest things you will ever see. Van Peebles is a joke in this film.\n\nRobots cant bluff... PSYCHE!\n\nI have to say though the special effects are actually amazing... PSYCHE! DVDs were probably even out when this film came out but if I had my way it would be a straight to VHS release yes people it is THAT bad!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
