The cinematics are of higher resolution and even better than what you saw in the previous game. While several units such as the Mammoth Tank made a reappearance, there are also plenty of new units including full compliments of maritime and air elements. The level design is even better than before. The best part of this game is however, the difficulty. Even under normal difficulty, it is very challenging.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
