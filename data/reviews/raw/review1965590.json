The script, the action, the characters are all from the Fifties-- but still watchable, even NOW, as a Saturday night flick.\n\nBest to watch with friends so you can tear it to pieces together!\n\nIf anything, the aliens in TODAY\u0027S films do a lot better job of flying than these do. When I first saw this in the late Sixties (In Black \u0026 White)-- I was wowed and awed. \n\nNOW-- I keep asking: Are those aliens on Crack or something? Don\u0027t they know that drugs and piloting don\u0027t mix? \n\nTake away that AstroLicense!!!", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9" } }
