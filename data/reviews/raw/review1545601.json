I wonder if it would cause anyone to have the same reaction today.\n\nIt might have been that this came out right after \"Deliverance\" and the idea was too see how far one could get away with pushing these things. Still, to this day, it is to my mind still the ugliest ten minutes or so from any major studio release. I can\u0027t believe Hope Lang, not an unknown actress; took the part knowing what She was in for or didn\u0027t walk off the set. \n\nJeff Goldblum, as far as I know, never talks about it; and tends to list his walk on in \"California Split\" as his first film.
