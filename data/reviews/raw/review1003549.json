Sarah Jessica parker was so fun to watch at such a young age and she puts forward a great performance with an acting style that is so reminiscent of the top notch performances she gives to this day. a sweet,entertaining and funny at times little film that left me wondering why i hadn\u0027t heard of or seen before. definitely at the top of my collection.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
