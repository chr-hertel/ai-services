I live with a lady from Dublin and a great many of my friends, here in Israel, are Irish as well.\n\nThere is no point repeating the plot, others have done so better than I could. It is very funny, it is beautiful to look at and I itch to visit Ireland again so that I can visit the locations. Even in winter Galway looked green and magnificent.\n\nThe acting is superb throughout. Anything with the Milo O\u0027Shea and David Kelly just has to be. But I am unfair to single out any actors, they are all great, as was the script and direction. True, the story could have told in an hour or so, but who cares, we went to bed happy. I only recorded it from TV one night we were out because it was Irish, no way I will ever wipe it.\n\nLet me single out one scene. That in which the Senator is introduced to his \"family\". Absolutely priceless and should be in anyone\u0027s top 100 funny film bits. When the boy enters from the left and says ......... but, no, that would be a spoiler. Just see it for yourself.\n\nAs for the swearing. I was not offended, it just added authenticity. And the matchmaking really does happen in a small village in Ireland.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
