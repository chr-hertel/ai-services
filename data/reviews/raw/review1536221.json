This is definitely the scariest movie of the year. It is extremely horrifying and violent. Definitely not suitable for ages 17 and under...and I\u0027m only 12. I still can\u0027t get over how extremely graphic and grisly the violence and torture was. And the plot line was very disturbing. I\u0027ve been having nightmares ever since. This is definitely NOT suitable for children like myself. Your kids will never get over how horribly and terrifyingly frightening Turistas is. If you let your child see this movie, you will regret it.\n\nBut on the bright side this movie is very intense and graphic...and I\u0027m a big fan of graphic gore and intensity...and disturbing images. The theme I couldn\u0027t handle though...too disturbing. See Turistas. If you\u0027re over 17, you will not be disappointed.\n\nOriginal MPAA rating: R: Strong Graphic Violence and Disturbing Content, Sexuality, Nudity, Drug Use, and Language\n\nMy MPAA rating: R: Strong Graphic Violence and Gore Including Torture and Disturbing Content, Language, Sexuality, Nudity, and Drug Use.\n\nMy Canadian rating: R: Extremely Gory Violence, Coarse Language, Sexual Content", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
