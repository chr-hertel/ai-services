The film tells pretty much what the title says as we see a man get robbed and eventually a cop shows up. This is a pretty interesting short that takes place in front of a single cardboard set and lasts just 25-seconds. That\u0027s just long enough because the film plays two jokes, which I won\u0027t reveal, yet both are very funny with the final joke being downright hysterical. I\u0027ve watched somewhere near a thousand of these early films the past several years and this one here is one of the gems of this era." }
