Honestly, it was one of the show during the French program \"Coucou c\u0027est nous\", and I didn\u0027t remember it was so fun !\n\nMaturin the Bear (reference to an old french evening program for children, \"Bonne nuit les enfants\"), Bob and Renate the parents and Greg - their son - are the protagonists of this short show (just 1/2 minutes per day).\n\nFull of acid humour, big gags and some old special effects, this show succeed to make you laugh without almost any word of sex or stuff like this.\n\nDon\u0027t miss the DVD, especially for French audience, if you liked this show.\n\nThe DVD contains about 100 minutes of non stop show." }
