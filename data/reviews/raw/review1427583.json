I had heard about it and wondered but had no idea of what to expect. It is the most powerful movie I have ever seen in my forty nine years. I had recently returned from Los Angeles and the beach area after having experienced real life gangs there and was working on a novel following up on these experiences. I don\u0027t know if we can ever really solve the underlying racial attitudes that prevail in this country. I also saw much of the \u0027white backlash\u0027 recently when I was out there and saw all of the characters as believable (both white and black) portraying the different gangs and why they hate each other and are ready to take it to the death. I feel this movie will help young people try and realize the consequences of racial escalation. I unfortunately feel that this country will never solve this and understandably the movie leads us to believe this also. The best lesson is it takes the consequence of violence to either change or manipulate behavior. As shown, it can go from one extreme to the other without resolve. Be prepared with this movie as it leaves no judgement with either white nor black..." }
