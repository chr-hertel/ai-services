A night, a woman\u0027s VW van breaks down near an apparently deserted house. She\u0027s grabbed by someone and runs, but then ends up staying the night. There\u0027s a flashback to her having seduced and killed a computer operator who worked at the American embassy in Mexico who bought one of her strange paintings. She kills by removing a hairpin from her ponytail, then drinking all the blood.\n\nShe meets a young guy she likes, while continuing to kill other people. Meanwhile, a man in giallo garb (black trenchcoat, black gloves, black broad-brimmed hat, plus a black handkerchief over the face kills a morgue attendant to get a look at one of her victims, killing him in the same way.\n\nRegrettably, the videotape I rented blacked out during a couple of the seductions scenes! What the heck!\n\nCarradine has a small role, but a good one." }
