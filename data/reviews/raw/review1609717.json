This film is somehow in the bottom 100 IMDb films when it\u0027s a lot funnier and more enjoyable than most of the top 250, and for my money, that equates to \"better\". \n\nIt has few special effects, CGI or otherwise, but refreshingly has invention, wit and warmth instead, and some super acting at least from the younger cast members. I found Patrick Smash convincing enough to engender a great deal of sympathy, and he becomes a very British sort of a hero. Young genius Alan A Allan is a cross between Patrick Moore and Alan Turing, and would have won WWII single handedly.\n\nPatrick\u0027s sister is very, very funny, and the episodes with the school bully and his entourage are well done, and bring back some scary memories.\n\nThe whole film is \"tongue-in-cheek\", the car included: think of MIB, compare with the idea and budget of Thunderpants and you\u0027ll maybe see why the car looked the way it did. What do you want, another \"Gone with the Wind\"?", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
