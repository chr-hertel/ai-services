It has a terrific script with poems integrated into speeches, etc. When Elizabeth says goodbye to the Duke of Anjou there is her voice-over of a stanza or so from a poem attributed to Elizabeth, \"On Monsieur\u0027s Departure\" a poem by Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nStrangely enough I\u0027ll be teaching the poem to my students in the next few weeks, so the video will come in handy for helping them understand the central tension of the poem.\n\nMy Freeview box is playing up a little so I\u0027ll need to buy the DVD when it comes out - and I\u0027d be glad to do so, too. \n\nI\u0027m looking forward to the next episode that is scheduled on MORE 4 tomorrow evening.#\n\nUS viewers, don\u0027t miss this as it one of the best scripted and acted dramas that I\u0027ve seen all year.\n\nDogberry", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
