My brother and I grew up watching this movie and now years later I still pull this out of my stack and watch it.\n\nI love the little sister in the movie because she is hilarious. From her fischer price roller skates to her Thorn gear she is something else. I always remember the part where she embarrasses her brother about having a huge crush on their babysitter. It\u0027s so funny because he\u0027s in his teenage years where he is really awkward with girls but still tries to impress them.\n\nHowever, my favorite part has to be the beginning seen where Elizabeth Shue, the babysitter is singing and dancing aroung her room while she gets ready for her date." }
