I figured Gilligan finally got off of the island and became a writer who wanted little kids to hang out in his apartment from 3 to 6. Funny enough I can remember the theme song being \"3 to 6Â…. 3 to 6 he helps out parents from 3 to 6\" I don\u0027t even think there were 3 episodes, it sucked so bad they pulled it off the air. I cant really remember the rest of the cast, however i am pretty sure that the kids were ethnically diverse. I guess Bob Denver peeked as Gilligan, it would have been nice if he was able to have success with another show. \n\nI was disappointed in the show; the premise would not fly in this day.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
