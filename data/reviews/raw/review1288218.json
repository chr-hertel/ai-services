Mixing the creation of a movie and his viewing. It\u0027s done in a very ambitious way, incredibly sophisticated and elegant when we know the budget who was assigned to the movie.\n\nA lot of scenes are incredible, specially the one who shows the contamination of the priest, adding a reflection on the condition of the black man. Obviously the last scene is one of the most incredible things I\u0027ve seen on a screen, but we can doubt the mental health of Von Trier and his crew. However maybe it\u0027s the reason he\u0027s so good...\n\nI didn\u0027t like a few things.
