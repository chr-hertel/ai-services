The film is expertly crafted and very stylish, which makes up for the story and acting flaws. And there are quite a few. While I think this is definitely better directed than Red Dragon - not surprising, given the two directors involved - it is not nearly as well-written or as well-acted. William Petersen is the lone bright spot, as he\u0027s the only one from the cast better than their Dragon counterpart; he delivers an effective and sympathetic performance. Brian Cox is solid as Lecter (spelled Lecktor in this one) but he\u0027s nowhere near Hopkins\u0027 iconic character, and Tom Noonan is creepy but underused as Dolarhyde. This one deviates more from the book to take creative license, and that lowers it, in my eyes, though the climax - with \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" - is excellent. A solid addition to the franchise, but it\u0027s bested by Red Dragon.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
