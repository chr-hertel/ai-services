Still you can already feel a well made atmosphere throughout the movie and though the dialog seems a bit too long a few times, there is still room for interesting thoughts about life and great comedic moments that will make you laugh. Actors worked great on this one and considering that the movie was made with a practically not existing or a very, very, very little budget it still got out very nice. Keep watching out for upcoming movies of this young director Elijah Tabere.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
