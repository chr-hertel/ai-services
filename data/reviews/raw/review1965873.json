I was pretty excited when news of the movie popped up on one of my RSS feeds. So I watched it the first opportunity I got. The movie didn\u0027t disappoint me but at the same time it left me wanting. By the end of it I was like \"That\u0027s it?\" Looking at the games you expect a lot of shooting. Not just \"Once upon a time in Mexico\" amount of shooting. I\u0027m talking about \"Rambo\" x6 amount of shooting. And in this movie there was just not enough shooting. However I do think the filmmakers did a fine enough job in making the few shooting scenes in the movie pretty cool.\n\nMy biggest complain is with the main Character. Mark Wahlberg should\u0027ve at least played the game to get a feel for Max but he didn\u0027t (according to the trivia section) and that\u0027s a big blunder in my book. If your playing an established character you need to study said character. If he did, maybe he would\u0027ve done more shooting.\n\nIn the games Max is driven by revenge into a long and painful downward spiral into the depths of the underworld due to the murder of his wife and daughter. He is so consumed that he does not stop even in the face of death and dishonor and becomes a one man army. In the movie the motives are the same but Wahlberg\u0027s Max seemed...tamed compared to the game. in the movie Max seemed emulating some old 80\u0027s detective while ought to be more of a no-holds-barred, loose-cannon, cowboy. Maybe he just didn\u0027t do enough shooting.\n\nLastly, i just don\u0027t like how they added all these extra main characters to the story. Sure some of them were necessary but the Movie should\u0027ve focused on the few main characters. That\u0027s one of the things that made the game great. You only follow the stories of the people who matter to the story. I don\u0027t like the new characters because they replace the roles of the game Characters. The major villain in the game was featured in the movie but the role of that character was severely underplayed and spread across several other characters. Not good. The filmmakers just ruined a character I loved to hate from the game.\n\nAll in all, a not so bad movie. It resembles the game in story and feel enough that it\u0027s still familiar to fans of the game. The action is pretty good, the cinematography is very good, and the direction is also good.\n\nIn the end of it all, the movie just needs more characterization a darker feel...and lots more shooting", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6" } }
