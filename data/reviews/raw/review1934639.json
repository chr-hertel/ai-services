The first Ford attempt came off as more his movie than a properly done one based on a book by a solid writer. This gets closer to a healthy mix of the two. There is still action, and it\u0027s well-done, but it doesn\u0027t feel like it\u0027s struggling with the political thriller aspects for the spotlight(not only because of the considerably lesser amount). The pacing is pretty good, this is never boring. The plot is interesting, and I\u0027d say the Clancy feel is a stronger presence in this than in its immediate predecessor(hey, you can go elsewhere for a straight Harrison flick, no?). The acting is relatively solid all the way. The characters are well-written and credible, for the most part. The editing and cinematography tend to be nice in this. The special effects leave little to be desired. The dialog has memorable lines, like the first in the series. The language does have some harsh words, but fewer(not to be confused with milder) than in the previous effort. The DVD holds a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to fans of the franchise, Tom Clancy and/or Harrison Ford. 7/10", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7" } }
