I recommend this film highly, not just for the unmistakably funny and outstanding performance by Will Smith but also for the input of the sexy and sultry Eva Mendes. This is a rom-com but unlike other movies of this genre it doesn\u0027t come across as pretentious because it never tries to be anything other than this, instead it builds upon it\u0027s strengths which include Smith\u0027s ability to create humour out of nothing but also his ability to get the best out of his co-stars such as Eva Mendes. As well as the tremendously funny scenes with Smith and Kevin James, there is also unbelievable chemistry between Mendes and Smith which makes this film a way above average romantic comedy. So if your in the mood for a not just a \u0027chick flick\u0027 but an acting masterclass then Hitch is for you. Alas i give this movie an astounding A+", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10" } }
