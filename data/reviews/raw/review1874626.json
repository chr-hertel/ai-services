As with all of Dickens novels, a ninety minute movie can do them little justice. It was therefore wonderful to see how the director used the six hours to great affect in \u0027Our Mutual Friend\u0027. The adaptation has no weak or flat spots, and the actors are without question perfect for every character, my own favourites being Mr Boffin, the loch keeper and the \u0027one legged man. Without detracting from the acting or plot line,the director gives us a sumptuous visual feast, without becoming too \u0027Dickensian\u0027. I am biased by believing there is no greater creator of story lines and characters than Charles Dickens, and had he been alive today he would have undoubtedly been very heartened at this attempt to bring his genius to the screen." }
