I would give it a 7.75 out of 10.\n\nThe good:\n\n1. Outstanding performances, especially Bette Davis, George Sanders and the under-rated Celeste Holm\n\n2. A witty and erudite screenplay\n\n3. outstanding direction\n\n4. A rich and in depth character study \n\n5. An excellent blend of comedy and drama\n\nThe bad:\n\n1. Anne Baxter gave a stilted, and affected performance\n\n2. Eve Harrington\u0027s ability to fool these sophisticated show business people so quickly and so convincingly was unbelievable.\n\n3. The theater crowd surrounding Margo Channing accepted Eve Harrington without any questions or reluctance immediately and without reservation.\n\n4. The playwright and his wife seemed to have a real solid marriage. It was improbable that he would leave his wife for Eve.\n\n5. Gary Merrill, whom I like as an actor, was about as over-the-top in his acting style as one can get in the opening scenes. He was gesturing as if he were Peter Finch\u0027s character in \"Network.\"\n\n6. The ending was not believable when the young actress was about to repeat the cycle using Eve this time.\n\nThe ugly * All of the smoking on screen gave me a psychosomatic asthma attack.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8" } }
