And I watch many movies, all kinds of genres.\n\nComedies are supposed to make you laugh. \"Anchorman\" was very mediocre, but I at least had a few good laughs. Dodgeball was so unfunny, it was painful to watch. It was the first movie directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, and it showed. This won\u0027t look good on his short resume\n\nThere\u0027s a reason Hollywood is struggling. When you watch Dodgeball, you can see why when they release this crap and expect people to pay $8-plus to suffer through it. I didn\u0027t think the movie would be great, but I was shocked how lousy, clich√© and unoriginal it was.\n\nBen Stiller\u0027s character is TOO over-the-top, if that\u0027s possible, and simply embarrassing for his overrated career. Vince Vaughn can be a funny guy, but the writing is so atrocious, he\u0027s a pretty invisible character.\n\nThis review is a friendly warning so you don\u0027t waste 90 minutes of your time, which could be better spent picking up dog crap in the back yard.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
