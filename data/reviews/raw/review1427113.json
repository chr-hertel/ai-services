(AMC Eden Prarie; Eden Prarie, MN; Opening Night, 7:15pm showing) Oh, and then there is a stunned silence at the end, after which you hear murmers such as \"what the f was that?\" and \"somebody shoot me in the face.\" Also, about 12 people walked out 2/3 of the way thru the movie.\n\nSometimes I think that the person who made 6th sense is actually locked up in a basement somewhere and the person who made this movie is some evil impostor out on a mission to destroy Sham\u0027s career. Everything that the 6th sense was, Lady in the water isn\u0027t. If anyone sees Shamilan walking down the street, please slap him for me and ask for my 12 cents back that he got from my admission ticket.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1" } }
