Wrong! The main reason being it was never actually horrifying - thus, it pretty much becomes disqualified from the horror category, right? The \"monsters\" were revealed too soon (what was with the humping?), the plot and character development was poor in terms of keeping the viewer engaged, there was too much dilly-dallying of characters, the action scenes were in \"fast-forward\" and the decent scenes too fast so bad acting seemed to last forever. The intro of characters (hero, heroine, grandma, etc) is funny but doesn\u0027t really follow the later-to-be-revealed storyline (although the Old Man dying in 70min is pretty good). Generally not scary so depending on what you expect from a horror film, you can judge whether it is worth it.", "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3" } }
