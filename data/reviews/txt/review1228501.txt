Queen is my favorite band, and this was an excellent concert. It was charged from the beginning to the end, including a version of Jailhouse Rock that was almost just as good as Elvis Presley's. Freddy's common eccentric and charismatic acting was as evident here as in any performance he gave. At about 2/3 of the way through, there's a drum and guitar solo, so All the members could take a break. But the guitar solo is good (Brian is no Jimi Hendrix or Eric Clapton, but he is still a very skilled guitarist nonetheless), and i thought the drum solo left a touch to be desired (Sorry Roger, i respect you, but it just seemed partially lacking. But he was performing hard throughout the entire concert). This was an early concert of theirs, and i own it on DVD. Well worth the $15 it cost me, but i bought it at Fry's, and they aren't a discount house for movies. If you have never heard of Queen (god forbid... just think of We Are The Champions and We Will Rock You and Bohemian Rhapsody (Wayne's World). That was them), but you like AC/DC or Aerosmith, or heavy metal/classic rock at all, Queen is well worth checking out.

P.S. I know this is terribly written, but i'm sick, so don't bother me :p
