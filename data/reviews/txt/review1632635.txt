Wall of Secrets - This wasn't a bad movie, but I would've liked to see them expand the female character a bit more; for example have her join a law firm as well as getting involved with the "mystery" involving the people in the apartment building. Or expand the male character by showing him at work a bit more. The director has left it up to the viewer's imagination too much. The male character left Seattle for a supposedly great job in Chicago, but we never saw him in an office setting or interacting with other work colleagues, except for the scene at the cocktail party. Also, I would've liked to see more of a background of the two characters, such as starting off the movie with both of them still in Seattle preparing for the move to Chicago, so the viewer would have more of an indication where the characters were coming from & where they were headed. I believe a scene from this movie was filmed at my son's school and I would like to know where I can get a copy of the movie. I have looked in some stores, but they don't have it. Was it just a made for TV movie or was it also put out on video/DVD? If I can purchase it I would like to know where/how? If it is strictly a made for TV movie, will it ever be on TV again?
