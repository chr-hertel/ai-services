Fans of Jennifers Aniston should know that she is not the main character. She is actually a third banana. Clive Owen as the hapless hero and Vincent Cassel the heavy in the piece clock most of the screen time. The movie is a good little thriller. Its machinery could be derailed easily enough with a choice that seems obvious enough. The machine chokes and sputters to get to the very end. The mail clerk and his uncle could have been written out with no ill effect. It might have been a tighter story without them. One suspects that Hollywood film still have that social monkey on its back. Let's hope for a brighter day and more Jennier Aniston in the next movie that she is in.
