The film "The Magdalene Sisters", directed by Peter Mullan in 2003 documents the rough life of four young Irish women who were given into the Magdalene Asylums of the 1960s and 1970s, where they have to work hard in a laundry under the strict supervision of some nuns, who keep them obeying through sadistic punishments. The Magdalene women have to bear up against sexual, physical and mental abuse in consequence for the sins they have committed.

Those horrible scenes which show the inmates struggle to maintain honor and pride are as hard to watch as it is frustrating. It allows you to get a feeling of the desperate situation and the bleakness all in the convent. The film represents the dark atmosphere authentically and is a good balanced critic of society.
