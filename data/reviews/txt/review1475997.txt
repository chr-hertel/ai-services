I found this movie appealing in several ways. The main one that comes to my mind is the subject of our futures and whether they are written in stone. The Enterprise travellled back in time through a wormhole to attempt to stop the Borg from destroying their present existence. I think of my study in the Bible Book of Ezekiel and how the human effort of the peoples of Tyre (now situated off the coast of Lebanon) had reversed the prophecy which Ezekiel had made about King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon destroying them in war around 586 BC. The prophecy was reversed temporarily as Ezekiel notes. This was because their determined effort for seven years had caused the Babylonians to quit and retreat. Later God caused Alexander the Great to finish them off. But even the prophesied future of peoples can be altered at times by determined human effort. It was also interesting to see humanities and technology (not science) together. Some science people aren't very cultured people in real life. I was in science until the profession or the government started violating my human rights. Then I did not even look at a sci-fi movie for years! Star Trek movies and TV shows, especially the ones with William Shatner are more intelligently written that Star Wars movies. I had watched a rerun of a Star Wars movie on TV with them firing all those photon torpedoes and all I could think of was a corny 80's video game! Star Trek used to have some heavy philosophical and moral issuezx in them. Yet I am not a science geek. I have been out in the world and have had my education in the school of life as well. Yet this movie interested me very much and I bought the video.
