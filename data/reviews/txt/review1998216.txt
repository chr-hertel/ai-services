General over view: 

cons: the game is too short problems with the camera for some its too easy to beat

Pros: The game is beautiful - fantastic art. the music is awesome..and of course familiar. The acting is great. In particular the lead actors- The Apprentice, Juno, Proxy, Maris and Kota. The way their images were used in the animation was cool. The performances they all gave were great...also the voice actors for the smaller roles, I thought were good too. 

The story is great too. There was a lot to fit in, and I didn't think they would make it work, but they did. I was happy with what they created and how it all tied together. 

I think the main problem was over-hype. The game is great- it just was slightly less amazing than the initial hype lead everyone to believe. I don't know how they could have made everyone happy - but I think this worked for the majority of the masses. I know I enjoyed it and almost all of my friends felt the same way.
