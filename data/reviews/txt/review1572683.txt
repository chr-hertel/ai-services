I'm actually watching it right now, and it's not to shabby and I'm not that big of a Julia Styles fan, BUT you CANNOT make a sequel and NOT use the same characters. It's horrible that way. It's like the 3rd and 4th Home Alone's.. I mean what were they thinking? Why couldn't you have just hired the same actress people?! The graphics also sucked, the butterflies in the room were incredibly to fake, if I'm going to see a movie I'd like it to be good. As the quote ahead of mine said, it's almost as if they're copying The Princess Diaries 2, and in the world of movies, I think that's a no no. So all in all my reaction to this movie is that it royally sucked. Bad script, bad acting, and poor choices in actors and graphics.
