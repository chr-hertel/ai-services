This 3rd installment of the POTC trilogy is by far the BEST in my view. Each character in this movie really gets some serious screen time but more importantly the plot comes together in ways you'd never expect. Critics that pointed out that key characters each had their own plots and treachery weren't kidding. The movie seriously ends on a note you'd never quite expect and that is the genius of this particular installment. I think honestly my favorite character in this now is Lord Beckett, ruthless as he is, Tom Hollander did an excellent job filling out the role of a villain beyond his part in POTC 2. Almost comfortable that he is playing the part.

This I will purchase when it comes out on DVD.
