This is another Euro-western directed by Demofilo Fidani a.k.a. Miles Deem. Like the other Fidani movies I have seen, this one isn't as bad as his movies are reputed to be. It certainly doesn't rank up there with the greatest spaghetti westerns of all time, but it's still pretty decent entertainment for people who like the genre.

The acting is a bit below average, except for Klaus Kinski who puts in a fine performance. The story is good enough to keep ones interest throughout the whole film, and there is plenty of action. The stunt-work and gunfights are done quite well. Hunt Powers as Tomayo has the perfect look for a spaghetti western, and with his long hair and big mustache, appears as though he could have walked out of an actual photograph from the late 1800's.

The music score isn't outstanding, but it is suitably styled for a spaghetti western, so it's still way better than any music one would hear in an American western.

If you are really into spaghetti westerns, and not just the most popular ones, This is a good one for a lazy afternoon when you just want to be entertained without having to think about it too much.
