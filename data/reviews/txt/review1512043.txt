In one of a few instances in which a cat and mouse are forced into an alliance, a cat tries to use a mouse's musical talent to make himself look like a virtuoso. I guess that overall, there's nothing particularly special about "Pizzicato Pussycat", although it's a good opportunity to hear some classical music (the Looney Tunes cartoons certainly had a way with classical music, as "A Corny Concerto", "Rhapsody Rabbit", "Long-Haired Hare", "The Rabbit of Seville", "What's Opera, Doc" and "High Note" all showed). Worth seeing, if only once.

I wonder what they meant by "Pizzicato". The only know Pizzicato that I know is a pizzeria.
