OK, the scripting really was pretty awful and some of the acting was, as previously mentioned, more wooden than a redwood, but my main gripe which, to be fair, is probably not going to be something many people have even thought about, is that the voice of KITT never actually sounds like it's coming from the car. It just sounds as though its been added on as a voice over in post production (which is obviously the case i realise). What i'm getting at is that the original actually had a 'boxey' sound as though it were coming out of the speakers in the car, or even a small speaker under the center console. This is still where the voice would come from even in todays car so i do hope they do some sound processing to make it at least SOUND as though the voice is coming from the car and not some magical disembodied voice....

It's also a shame that they are alienating a huge group of potential viewers by having the adult themes which really add nothing to the story or the characters. If they cut out the actual killings and the sexual references, the show would not be anything less than it already is, and there would be no problem with all ages watching it as was the case in the original. The only reason this would be successful is BECAUSE kids watched the original and have now grown up but still have fond memories of KR. If they now disregard that generation this time round, whilst they may get ratings from the older generation, the show will NOT have the longevity the original still has..... Though what do i know eh?..........
