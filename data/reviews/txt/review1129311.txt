Remember watching Jaws and saying "that could never happen!" ... well now you get to see it put to the test. In this episode, Jamie and Adam put some shark tales to the test to find out what's fact and what's fiction. Can you defend yourself by punching a shark? Can a shark punch through a boat? Can a shark break through a metal cage? Willing shooting a tank of compressed air (that's in a shark's mouth) explode a shark's head? Can a shark tow a boat? You'll never know if you miss this! If you're a fan of shark week, then you don't want to miss this. It's worth tuning in for just to see the hosts looking terrified, underwater, and surrounded by sharks.
