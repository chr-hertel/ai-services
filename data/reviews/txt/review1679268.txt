When i first sat down to veiw this movie i was skeptical. Having read the book first i knew the basic storyline, knew how sadistic Tyler was, knew how hopeless Ed Norton's character was before he met Tyler and knew how we are shown an important lesson throughout the course of the story. Putting all that aside i found this movie brilliant the carefree attitude Pitt uses for Tyler is almost exactly like he is portrayed in the book. Marla Singer is played beautifully and even Big Bob (played by meatloaf) are exact of what they should be in counterpart to the book. Even for those who are squeamish i must digress how important this film is on the veiws it presents of socioty. The sinister tone all throughout is very apparent and is brilliantly achieved through some of the minor characters. All in all everyone should at least experience fight club at one point in their lives and it is definitely in my top ten.
