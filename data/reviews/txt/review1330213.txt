The New Urban drama/comedy ATL,about a group of friends coming of age in Atlanta,was better than I expected in so many ways:It was sweet.It had heart.It was funny in real and unexpected ways,and it had a pace and rhythm all its own.

Another reviewer mentioned "Cooley High" as a reference,but I would also add American Graffiti,especially in using a central location,in this case a roller skating rink,as the focus of the action,as the meeting place of the kids in the area.

I'm afraid that once the word gets around that this isn't another tough,gangster style film,that it will die quickly at the box office,as evidenced by the bored,loud teenagers I saw the film with tonight.

Are small,personal African American films like ATL and "Something New" doomed to failure because of their refusal to dumb down to their audiences with broad,crude humor?I hope not,but why should they be any different than white audiences that cant see a good thing if their lives depended on it either.

End of rant.Take a chance on a film that takes a chance.
