I rented this one based on nothing more than a blurb about Asian horror films.

There was horror, kung-fu, action, and a bit of sex mixed in the wok to serve up this one. The stabbings were more graphic than a film of this nature usually drags out. The nudity was a bit OTT (and a tad unrealistic.) But the feminist undertones were a welcome addition.

The mondo style scenes probably shook a few people up, but this is a mainstay of most Asian horror. And mondo fans would probably be disappointed. The disembowelment scene was a gross-out. The live worms helped.

Chinese female vampires? Use you imagination guys. Or see the film.

And fans of Johnny Carpenter's "Big Trouble In Little China" will spot big Carter Wong as a horseman.
