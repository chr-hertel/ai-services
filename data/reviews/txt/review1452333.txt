For a die hard fan (fan - its an ambiguous word) of old Japanese movies, especially those depicting Samurai and the agonizingly painful period of civil war, Shichinin no samurai stands alone and proud, proud of its every single frame, every single dialogue and lastly, proud of its immortalized characters. I've seen quite a few civil war movies, Seppuku ('62), Onibaba ('64), Sanjuro ('62) and nearly all of Kurosawa's flicks, but the difference in them and the Seven Samurai lies in its experience. A good one hour into the movie and you'd want to live with the characters, fight with the samurais, curse the bandits and fall in love with a girl. The storyline of this movie is of epic proportions, not even close to any movie you'd have encountered till now, and the way the minutest element of the film is handled, it just makes you sit and appreciate in awe. Every character is portrayed as if we've been living with them for years, just that they're now on screen instead of being with us. A sign of a good movie is that it lasts, a sign of an excellent movie is that it lasts longer, while a sign for a movie like this is that it'll embed itself in your mind and heart for a long long time to come, and you'll cherish every moment remembering it.
