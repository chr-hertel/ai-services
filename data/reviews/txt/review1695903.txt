Joss Hutcherson plays Jess, a lonely bullied kid who befriends the school newbie Leslie (the superb AnnaSophia Robb), together they invent an imaginary world, Terabithia, which they explore to escape the drab mediocrity of their school and in Jess' case home lives.

I have to admit I was expecting something along the lines of "The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe", but I couldn't be more wrong.The film is set in small town in modern day America, Joss' parents show very little love or affection to him, something he becomes more aware of when at Leslie's house when they 'help' paint a room.The film also deals with very adult themes, that as a child bad things can happen, you can lose people you love and care for.

The two leads are excellent, and for two actors barely in their teens they should have promising careers ahead of them, my only criticism is that I wish Zooey Deshanel would put a few pounds on, she does look a bit skinny nowadays! 8.5/10
