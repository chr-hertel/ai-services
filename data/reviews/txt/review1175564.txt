thomas in love is an engaging story and with aesthetically pleasing cinematography and colorful sets

i wish the relationships between the characters could have been developed a bit more fully. perhaps casting was the issue because one 'cyber-girlfriend' was much more engaging than the other, which leaves you missing her towards the end of the film. 

it might have held together better if it had focused on one major relationship. almost seems as if there was enough raw material to develop into two separate films rather than trying to smush both relationships into one.

but overall, a really enjoyable film!

warning: fast forward past first few minutes if you don't know your date too well-- gratuitous cartoon sex could have been handled with more subtlety. didn't add much except titillation to the storyline.
