The Poseidon Adventure is and will always be my all time favorite film.I remember seeing it when I was a young boy at the Avalon movie theater at Kings Highway in Brooklyn. My parents and I sat in the balcony in Dec of 1972. The Gene Hackman Rev Scott character still has a tremendous effect on me, as his journey is quite a powerful one. I guess why I like the character so much is that he Questioned, which is what America was also doing at the time dealing with the aftermath of the Vietman conflict the year it was released. Ronald Neame who directed the film does a great job on the DVD extra's with his unique commentary. Its a must listen too. Personally I would love to see the film once again on the big screen and have gone as far as requesting it as a submission to the Clearview classic series which runs at the Zegfield movie theater in NYC a few times a year. I actually taped a tribute to this film and other disaster films on my radio podcast show on my site-entertainmenttodayandbeyond.com Im really proud of it! The Poseidon Adventure is the one film that I never tire of, and find it fascinating ever time I watch it!
