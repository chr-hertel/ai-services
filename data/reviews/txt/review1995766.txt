A couple of health gym trainers (Pitt, McDormand) obtain a CD that has CIA information on it and they try to sell it.

The above is the simplest explanation and major plot of the story, but this story really gets complicated and you just have to keep up as things move pretty fast too. However, the producers realized that we may get a little lost and have a CIA agent (Rasche) report to his boss (Simmons) everything that we have seen so far. They did this for us twice. Wasn't that nice of them? Lost no more.

For George Clooney to play a womanizer with that really bad looking beard didn't make sense. Here the beard was a distraction, not a turn on as I guess the director expected it to be. Reminded me of Blutto in a Popeye cartoon. 

I kept waiting for Frances McDormand to say, "Ya, you betcha." at times (go see Fargo).

There are some clever lines and antics but I wouldn't go so far to say they were laugh out loud lines and antics. Well, 7th graders may LOL. 

All is good and enjoyable and there are some twists and turns. And, one really big shocker.
