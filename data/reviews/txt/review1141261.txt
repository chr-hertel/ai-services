I disagree, it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I barely ever label movies that category,(the others are Retro Puppet Master, Dolls, and I'm 12, so don't laugh: 101 Dalmatians movies). I mean, you have your opinion and that's okay, but I also have mine, in case you do: Please don't ridicule my opinion like others do sometimes. I also think it is the best Puppet Master movie, also the puppets could beat Chucky anytime. Okay, I don't have anything else to say, hey, who else is young and likes 101 Dalmatians: the series? I've taped all the episodes off TV. Okay, I don't have enough lines yet, so, Who also think's Cadpig's funny?
