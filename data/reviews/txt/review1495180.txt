The first time that i watched the movie Two For the Money, I was very inexperienced and not knowledgeable of the amazing and quite popular world of sports gambling. I have played sports my whole life and have followed them, and considered myself an expert on the subject. That sentence that I wrote there is the problem that most of these gamblers have in there mind, on Sunday mornings, when they are using there last dollars on the packers because they believe in there heart of hearts that they will not lose to the vikings by more than 8 points. This movie is a very entertaining, yet sad story, when people our at there all time lows and are caught in the middle of one of the most vicious cycles in the world, gambling. Matthew Mchoungahey plays Brandon Lang, a former college football star who's career is prematurely ended after a gruesome knee injury. Looking to make some money, in between his failed attempts at a comeback, he records football picks for a rinky dink 1-800 Line. After a year of picking 80 percent winners, Brandon is tracked down by sports gambling tycoon Walter Abrahams(Al Pacino). A country boy is whole life, Brandon is astounded by the bright lights of the big city. As Brandon is being groomed as the next big thing in walters growing industry, he learns that this is more than a game, this is people's lives. After a string of successful weekends picking games, there comes a cold streak at the end of the regular season. As brandon realizes what is happening to the lives of the people that are bettin on his picks, he wants out of the game. But it will not be that easy as walter has bankrolled him to be his successors, and now brandon realizes he is not just gambling on sports, he is gambling with his life. With strong performances by Mchougnahey, Pacino, and Reno Russo, this action packed thriller is a winner. I'd bet on it!
