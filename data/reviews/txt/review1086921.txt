Director Nir Bergman creation is considered as one of the pinnacles of the Israeli cinema. The story is universal but also very intimate and local. Haifa, the working-class industrial and port city is the perfect background for the movie. an old Israeli song has the line "Haifa - A real city", and like the city in the background, the characters are all very real. Dafna (Silbersatz Banai) is a wary midwife-nurse, constantly escaping her unsolved grief of her recently deceased husband. The older children, Maya (Maron) and Yair (Gaviratz) try to find their own ways to cope with lose, like their mother, they rather run away than confront. The younger son, Ido (Magon), is acting calm on the surface, but his risk taking acts and social avoidance are showing the cracks in his psyche.

When the fragile family is facing a crisis, the characters must confront and solve their own grieving and accusations.

Maya try to escape to Tel-Aviv, the prototypical big city. Tel-Aviv is only 100km south of Haifa, but might as well be light-years away. She can escape to Tel-Aviv, but she takes the guilt and accusations with her, and in the big city, nobody cares.

Nir Bergman is delivering this bare-bone drama with a fist to the stomach. This is real life, No great love story, no special effects or action, with great supporting actors and soundtrack. It is an anthem for simple people, an anthem for the family and its strength. Rent this DVD and watch it with your loved one, you will not regret it.
