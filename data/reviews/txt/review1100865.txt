Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers star in this film. Although their initial meeting goes badly, they soon fall in love. However, in a crazy mix-up, Ginger thinks Fred is already married--and their lives, and that of poor Edward Everett Horton, get VERY complicated!

I love this old musical and this is saying something since I generally DON'T like musicals. So why do I like this one? The acting and supporting actors (such as Eric Blore, Helen Broderick and Edward Everett Horton, who were both very funny and endearing) are superb and the dialog is well-written. The music is also quite memorable and easy on the ears! I also like how the characters are more likable. Believe it or not, Irving Berlin was able to create a score even better than the Gershwins and Cole Porter in other Astaire-Rogers films---wow! Plus, instead of Ginger playing a cranky lady, here she is quite right to assume the worst and mistreat poor Fred--he is, at times, very annoying! And finally, the movie just seems to have incredible style and grace. You get some of this in the later movie "The Gay Divorc√©e" and a couple other of their films, though this one seems to feature Astaire and Rogers at the very top of their game--with great songs for their dance numbers. In fact, several of their movies look very similar, so I would say if you would watch only one, this is the one. As far as Astaire and Rogers go, this IS the closest they got to perfection.
