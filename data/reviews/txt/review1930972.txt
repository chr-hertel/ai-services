You'll come out wondering if the film was actually as funny as you thought while watching... And the answer will be yes. You just have to let go and enjoy--by whatever means you prefer.

Pineapple Express is another Seth Rogan crazy adventure a couple of guys go through, bonding along the way. This time James Franco makes the movie as a lovable burn out, not the typical role you'd expect from Green Goblin Jr. 

If marijuana turns you off then forget it, you'll hate the movie, But if you can chill out for two hours and laugh at the movie's action, stoner-antics, and borderline romantic male bonding then you'll get your ten dollars worth.
