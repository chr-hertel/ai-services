In a world where most movies contain much darkness and cynicism (though I like many of them), Amelie is so refreshing. It's about a good-hearted girl and how she tries to affect people's destiny. It's so charming, so full of color that it delights the eyes, funny, quirky - it just makes you want to smile. It's romantic without being cloying. I just watched it for the second time two nights ago, and it put me in such a great mood the next day. It presents the sort of world where you might want to live. So often, we see people who do things for their own gain, who use deception to cheat people, those who no longer care about others around them, and we've gotten so used to being wary all the time - and often, it's reflected in entertainment, it's so nice to see someone who delights in trying to make people happy and to improving lives, just for the sake of creating pleasure in other people, just because she sees an opportunity to do so. This is not warm and fuzzy in the usual way, where the saccharine nature, the predictable lines all get wearying - it feels so fresh and new, and yet, so much like a fairytale too. It's difficult to explain. I didn't get the full gist of it until I saw it myself.
