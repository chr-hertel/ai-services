I'm a huge lover of film, and the French Nouvelle Vague ranks as one of my favorite movements in film. I'm also a shameless fan of hit-man flicks, from "The Killer" to the recent outrage "Hitman" and everything in between. After only vaguely being aware of this film for many years, I picked it up and watched it- WOW! After all the movies I've seen in my life, after some years where I logged over 200 films in twelve months, it's nice to know that there are still hidden gems out there that can surprise. This film is totally mesmerizing- I sat immobile on my couch for the entire 105 minutes and didn't even realize it until it was over- I usually finish a movie over the course of a day or two (if it's on DVD), getting a drink, bathroom breaks, etc... I give this film a ten, and I've given movies on IMDb a 10 a total of five times- I rank it with the best...
