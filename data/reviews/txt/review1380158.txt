Why not using the exact text by the book? There are some scenes that are missing in the movie that I think would add to the story, and make the movie a little vague. Maybe that was the intention of the director Ron Howard, but I wish they were added. For example, the full meaning of the name of "Sir Leigh Teabing". Another thing is that the fact that Sophie Neveu has also a brother apart from her grandmother. However, this is a great directed movie and I was so glad I was able to view it finally after all the debates about it and the book itself. Moreover, the fine act of Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Jean Reno, and the great one: Ian McKellen.

Have a nice day, Shai.
