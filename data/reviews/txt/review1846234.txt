Juno is a movie about a sixteen year old who gets pregnant. No, it's not an episode of Maury, it's the story of a young girl who gets pregnant and tries to find a couple to adopt while, as she puts it, deals with "things way beyond my maturity level."

Juno is a very good, unique story and one of my favorite movies of the year. If you ask me (and in a sense you are.) the real star of this film is the script. Written by first time screenwriter Diablo Cody, Juno really is as they say "this year's little miss sunshine" It's refreshingly original, quirky and funny. It is also very heartwarmingÂ…but only towards the end. Through the majority of the film, like little miss sunshine, things pretty much get worse for the protagonists as time goes on but it is certainly not without laughs throughout. Besides, that is what makes the ending all the more powerful. The thing that struck me the most was the honesty in the dialogue. It certainly isn't completely realistic and Juno and her friend have more witty things to say then is probably natural but nonetheless, the dialogue in the film is probably more realistic than most. The film's acting is also something of note. Ellen Page, who was nominated for an Oscar for her role, delivers a great performance. In addition, the other actors in the film, such as Michael Cera and Jason Bateman also give good performances. Like his other roles, Michael Cera who plays Juno's love interest (more or less), plays awkward better than any actor I have seen. If you've seen Superbad or any episode of Arrested Development than you know what I'm talking about.

Juno is defiantly a movie worth seeing. Juno defiantly isn't a laugh-out-loud kind of comedy but I don't think that's what they're going for. With a good cast, simple humor, and a believable script, you can't really go wrong and I don't think they did.
