Snakes on a Plane is a good cheesy thriller with some great laugh moments as well. It's a popcorn film, if you can hold down popcorn while watching people be viciously and gruesomely attacked by slithering snakes. It's exactly the type of movie to watch with a few buddies on a Saturday afternoon.

Sam Jackson is pretty good, but his presence is lacking at times, as the film's story(if you can call it that) focuses on many more character's, including Kenan Tomphson's hilarious character. This is a funny movie, and sheer ridiculous situations and scientific impossibilities abound(a snake manages to eat a dog in about 2 seconds).

Don't expect to be blown away. It's not a scary movie, but it's a good b-movie with a big budget and pretty good special effects. i enjoyed it quite a bit.

8/10.
