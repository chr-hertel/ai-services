I would rank "Muriel's Wedding" in my 10 Best of all time, and just wanted to add one thing to the comments.

One of the great things about this movie is being able to watch Toni Collette and Rachel Griffiths do star turns at the beginning of their careers. Colette was already a star in Australia, though unheard of elsewhere, but both of these amazing actresses demonstrate in this film the qualities that have shown them to be among the most accomplished and versatile actresses in film and television today.

One more thing, I caught Toni Colette doing a star turn in the Broadway musical "The Wild Party." This woman is a great musical performer. I would be willing to bet her band is terrific.
