There was something very genuine and likable about this character when Stallone created ROCKY in 1976.

Young Rocky could fight like a bat out of hell but he had a tender side toward animals, children and the homely girl that worked in the pet store near the gym where he worked out.

This was a character we quickly came to care about. He wasn't evil and he didn't have an agenda to use people. He just wanted to be somebody.

It's a lesson in humility and perseverance and ultimately achievement.

If you only ever see one ROCKY, this is the one to watch. Rocky 2 and 3 are also good. Rocky 4 and 5 - not as good as the others.
