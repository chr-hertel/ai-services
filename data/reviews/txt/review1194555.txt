The best film of the year! Orlando Bloom can actually act and he and Kirsten Dunst have great chemistry. Susan Sarandon is wonderful as the mother and the memorial scene is touching and memorable. It's a story about love, friendship, death and most of all ... life. A fantastic soundtrack, as in most Cameron Crowe films. For the critics giving this movie terrible reviews, I don't think it's fair to review a movie in comparison to other movies from the same director. A movie should be reviewed according to how it stands up on its own. The movie resonates and stays with you days after ... it's the feel-good movie of the year! Since my friends and I walked out of the cinema, we have been discussing the movie and it seems to get better the more we think about it.
