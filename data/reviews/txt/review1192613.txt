A high class action western with some of the greatest performances in the history of American cinema. Kurt Russell was magnificent and after watching Val Kilmer's performance I was almost crying. The thing I like about this western is that it is different to a lot of the westerns made especially before the sixties. I am not saying that those westerns a rubbish but I do not like the love themes and and the way they set up the romance between the main characters. In Tombstone I thought that it was a western with its own original ideas. With its amazing cast including amazing talented actors Michael Biehn, Sam Elliot and Charlton Heston this film is a must see not just for fans of westerns but also for fans of action movies and movies.
