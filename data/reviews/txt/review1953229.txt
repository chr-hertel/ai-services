The tenants of a complex apartment building. Their lives turns upside down. When a young woman named Sally Day (Coralina Cataldi-Tassoni) turned into a demon and affecting her guests after watching an horror movie on TV! The tenants are trapped in the building. They have to do anything to survive the long night of total terror.

Directed by Lamberto Bava (A Blade in the Dark, Demons, Frozen Terror) made an stronger if maybe not better than the wildly entertaining (if incoherent) original. This one is better written, a little more plot, better acting and superior special effects. Dario Argento produced and he's one of the four screenwriters as well.

DVD has an good non-anamorphic Widescreen (1.66:1) transfer and an fine Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also has an audio commentary by the filmmakers, trailer and talent bios. The only problem with "Demons 2", when it comes to the ending. It doesn't know when to quit. The premise of the movie is somewhere cross between "David Cronenberg's Shivers" and "George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead". Bava certainly pays tribute to the first "Demons" picture and as well for "David Cronenberg's Videodrome" in one quick scene. Look for a young Asia Argento in a bit part. Some cast members from "Demons" plays different roles here. Horror fans will have an blast with this one. (*** 1/2 out of *****).
