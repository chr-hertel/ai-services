Clearly I'm not a Judd Apatow fan.Close high school friends try to get the girl and deal with the fact that very soon they will be at different colleges.Good funny, but not my cup of tea coming of age comedy that I just couldn't connect to. I think my problem is that a good number of people I know really like this film that it built up an unreasonable expectation. Then again I'm not a fan of anything Producer Judd Apatow has put out from his own film Knocked Up, to the films he either wrote or produced Walk Hard, Talladega Nights, Fun With Dick and Jane, Anchorman, Kicking and Screaming. Watching the DVD I found the need to jump to the next chapter a couple of times, not a good sign. Your mileage may vary.
