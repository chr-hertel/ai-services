Fernando Rey stars as Ivano,a wheelchair bound man with some strange perversions.He gets his sexual kicks by spying on Arturo,their tenant in the apartment next-door and forcing his sexy accomplice Olga to watch as well.To increase his perverse thrill,Ivano persuades Olga to seduce Arturo and to have sex him as he watches.Unfortunately for all involved,the sex game starts to get very deadly as it is learned that Arturo is a psychotic serial killer."The Eye Behind the Wall" is a bizarre and very sleazy sexual thriller.Sadly writer/director Giuliano Petrelli never made another film after this.It actually reminded me Alfred Hitchock's masterpiece "Rear Window".The film is atmospheric and features a good amount of nudity and sleaze.Check it out.8 out of 10.
