First I saw TBE high in the US Box Charts and then when it came out on DVD I remarked it in a store. I read the critics on IMDb before I bought it and thought this could work as the both FINAL DESTINATION. There were nonstop lot of twists and turns but perhaps too many effects. So I think even the so recommended Director's cut story could have been shorter. Yes, there are some nice points but I think it contents too many violence and should not be shown to children. I don't know why this one hasn't been presented in our theaters in Switzerland but this could be a reason what I mentioned before. The actors did a great job especially Ashton Kutcher that I saw for the first time surprised me very much. If you want to take an unusual ride don't miss this edge-of-your-seat-super natural thriller. My wife is not hot for TBE so the end rating is a solid 5/10.
