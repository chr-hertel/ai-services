i have seen the play once and i have to say i loved it. when i heard the movie version was coming out, i had to go see it. i absolutely loved it! the costumes were beautiful and the sets were amazing. the only thing i had a little problem with was the phantom's voice in the movie. i thought it wasn't strong enough for the phantom's voice. but i remembered hearing the play phantom's voice and thinking, 'he sounds like a leprechaun on helium.' so i would have to choose Gerard Butler's voice than the play voice. i'm gonna see it again on Wednesday and i can't wait! i recommend this movie to whoever loves phantom of the opera.
