Enjoyed the first film,"Left Behind", and found this film contained fantastic scenes of the Crying Wall, and a Rabbi who declares that Jesus Christ is the Lord. There is even a portrayal of the Anti-Christ himself who plans on taking over the world and a TV reporter who is determined to stop him in his tracks. The excellent cast of Christians once again tells the Story of a portion of the Book of Revelations, the last book in the New Testament. Many of the people lost their loved ones, and different people have various sides to the story they want to tell. This film clearly says that if you have Faith in God and Jesus you will never be alone and by His Grace, you will be saved from Eternal Judgement. Amen
