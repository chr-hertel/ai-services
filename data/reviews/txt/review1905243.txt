I have a personal rule that i never watch movies that score less than 6 on IMDb. However, I really enjoyed Sixth Sense and the Village and so on reading the reviews - some good, most bad - i decided to believe the 'you must have missed the point' reviews, mainly because i know people who didn't like the village. I was sorely mistake, this movie is a complete **** up - the script/acting/camera work are all bad. It was like watching a film made by high school students on their parents video camera.

I gave it three based on the fact thats its a marginally interesting idea, terribly realised.
