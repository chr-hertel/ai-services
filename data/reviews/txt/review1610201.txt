What we have here, is a classic "Bat out of Hell-esquire" situation. A lot of people think this show is crap, a lot of people think it's funny as hell. Some think it's immature, some think it's comedy gold. I can't really say much about this show which would appeal to everyone. I, personally, thought it was funny. It's a lot better than some of the stuff Adult Swim has been showing recently (Assy Mcguee, Morel Orel). The show in question, has a very random sense of humor, and this is what I think is the main turn-off for many people. Others, the ones who like it, see through this, and like the show BECAUSE of it's randomness. I am one of them, I think the show is good, and that's my opinion. I can't say the same for you. What I say, is take a look at an episode, and see if you like it. I think it would be worth your time, but again, you might think otherwise.
