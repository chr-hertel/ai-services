Hello :)

The crime series "Monk" is my favourite one! Besides the each time thrilling plot, it is the protagonist, the manic detective Adrian Monk who contributes to the popularity of this series.

Mr Monk is a retired Cop and now a private Detective because he is unable to join the police again due to his innumerable anxieties and manias. Nevertheless, he is a mastermind in solving homicides and other crimes. For this, he needs to be accompanied by his "baby-sitter" Sherona who helps Monk to cope with the daily life.

The way how Tony Shalhoub play the character Adrian Monk is outstanding! Each episode is surprising and exciting and they never become boring.

I recommend this crime series to everyone who wants suspense and a special way of humour (generated mostly by Monk's gesture & facial expression) at the same time! 

--> 10/10!
