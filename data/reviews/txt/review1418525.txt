I think different judges would make the show better. I don't feel any "relationship" with the judges. Also, there are too many jugglers and I think that type of talent has taken up too much time on the show. I wouldn't buy a ticket to see a juggler nor would I watch that type of talent on TV. I don't even enjoy watching the juggling auditions. Calling people from the audience seems to be too random for prime time TV. Some type of elimination should be done to make sure there aren't too many people with same type of talent before allowing the competitors to be a part of the audience. I also feel the judges allowed some people to pass through the first round to attract viewers who want to see goofy acts, for example, the male who was dressed up as an angel. It all goes back to judging and better judges should have chosen. I'm surprised Simon chose these judges--and I love Simon!
