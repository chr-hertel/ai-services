OKAY here we go = Plot of movie: A look at the state of the global environment including visionary and practical solutions for restoring the planet's ecosystems. USA I say 1 word...what about take an active part in the "Kyoto Protocol" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And NOT just make a movie about the end of the world !! Jesus....it's just so American !!...and what are you paying for your petrol for the car at the moment, is it $5 for 4,5 liter or what ???....while we in the rest of Europa is paying about $2 pr. liter !!!!!!!!
