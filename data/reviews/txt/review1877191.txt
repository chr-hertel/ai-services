I had never heard of this movie. But after hearing that Steven Spielberg directed it, I wanted to see it immediately. I made a smart choice. This movie is rich in emotion, storytelling, and history because of the author's background. Another truly marvelous thing in this movie is Christian Bale's performance. He breaks your heart as you watch it. It was another one of those movies where I was emotionally devastated when I saw it; it's right up there with "Rent," and "E.T." Now, it surprised me when I learned that it didn't do well in theaters because people weren't use to Spielberg's transition into drama. But man! I don't understand how anyone could be disappointed in this. It's an incredible film and it will remain incredible for as long as the world is here to see it.
