Why on earth did this movie get so popular? It isn't funny, in fact it is just stupid. My stomach turns every time I see a Vote for Pedro tee-shirt. This movie did what a lot of comedies fail at. By that I mean fool people int laughing at things that aren't funny. They do this by trying to confuse the person watching. If you don't understand it after you watch it 10 times, it just isn't funny. It isn't smart or artsy like the rest of the voters think, it is just plain stupid. Hopefully people will realize that it isn't good, and stop saying lines from it, or laughing at its' ridiculous brand of humor. Nothing about this movie is smart, or well written. Just face it the cast of this movie have successfully duped you. Probably the worst movie I have ever seen.
