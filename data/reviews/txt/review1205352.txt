Malev is a really great film about a boy, Uru, who was taken from his village by German crusaders. He is taken to a church, far from his homeland. There he meets a revolutionary monk-spy, Mentor Wolfram, from France, who works for a group of monks, who are after Estonian frogs. Wolfram teaches the boy to fight, to read and helps him in other ways too. Uru and Wolfram meet the Bishop in Riga at some point. There he overhears the plans to invade Estonia. Uru grows up and escapes with the help of Wolfram.

No one at home believes Uru and no one listens to him until one day the Germans attack. Uru goes from a village to a village searching for help. Finally a meeting of village elders is arranged and there they decide with Uru's help to create a militia to go up against the Germans.

Altogether it's a wonderful and a really funny movie and there is a really funny and twisted perspective on history in that movie. The only problem is, that most of the jokes in the movie can't be translated or they lose their point.

It was the first movie I went to see in the cinema in a really long time and it was really worth it. I'd really like to see it again.
