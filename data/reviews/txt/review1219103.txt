2 words to describe it: Total Crap! The idea isn't original, nor unique, nor good.

Suppose to be a comedy but it's only funny for a few seconds. Rest of it is plain stupid! The plot to the movie doesn't seem to have a good flow to it.

Too much gross out stuff, and jokes that aren't even that funny.

Some of you would say I'm crazy, but this wasn't my kind of movie.

This is not your moneys worth. It's deserves to be buried 1000 feet underground and never see the light of day for eternity! I give it a 1 out of 10. And place it on one of the bottom 100 films lists.

It's not worth buying nor worth seeing more than once. Save your money for something good! If you dislike this review then go ahead and place No on "Is this review helpful". Cause this would be the last choice I'd pick for a movie.
