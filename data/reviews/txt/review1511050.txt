The movie "Of Mice and Men" was really good. The story was very dramatic and interesting. It was similar to the book and a little bit better. I've got a better idea of what the setting was like and I understand it more after watching the movie. There were some parts of the movie where it was very dramatic and there were some parts of the movie where it was very boring. But overall the parts were very interesting and thrilling. In the movie, almost every part was covered from the book. The actors resembled very much like the characters in the book and the music was good in the specific parts. The actors acted like they were the actual characters and they were very dramatic. Especially George and Lennie. The actor of Lennie acted so much like the actual Lennie, the same thing with George. Overall the movie was really great and a wonderful experience for me.
