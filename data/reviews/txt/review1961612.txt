Do not go see this... I don't know what to say other than it was easily the worst movie I have ever seen. I usually like movies, even the fun the factor, no matter if it is good or not, but this was pathetic. Everyone around me was stunned. You could hear a pin drop after, and then a bunch of... "really" "did that just happen" None of these people should ever work in Hollywood, again the worst movie ever created I don't have any other words to describe it I am so confused that maybe it was so good that I think it's bad? I mean thats how bad it was No sane person could watch this and enjoy it Literally, not a sane person in the world
