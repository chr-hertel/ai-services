I'm never tired of watching this movie! it's superb and i admire the talents of the actors most of all Gerard butler's since he's not really a singer and he made an effort for this movie. on the other hand, Emmy rossum has a terrific voice which can never be replaced! my favourite scenes are the Don Juan play scene when they sing past the point of no return and the last scene when the phantom captures Raoul and asks Christine to choose. here one can see how the phantom felt and how he acted according the circumstance. he suffered but did not know how to control his emotions but at the same time... who doesn't pity him? i love the phantom's character and i really like Gerard butler's interpretation to it because it's exactly how i had imagined it to be and he succeeded in creating the poor, lonely, discriminated phantom. excellent performance from all actors!!
