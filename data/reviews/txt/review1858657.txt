I was not at all inclined to spend any money to see this at the local movie screen as it came out at Christmas, but when it came out on DVD it was the only title I found in the movie store that was similar to my genre. Do not fall into the same trap, this movie stinks. Actors are terrible, and the storyline was unbelievable. If an alien race was able to span the limits of space and be invisible to visible light wouldn't it stand to reason that they could land a spaceship without crashing it? I rented this movie as a direct result of Hollywood's lack of anything else to come out of the last years' crops. I cannot comment on the rest of the story as the movie was so bad that I turned it back in and rented a "B" movie instead.
