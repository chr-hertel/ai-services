That's the Hollywood pitch for this strange-o flick, meaning this movie is definitely not a Hollywood movie. It's done for pretty cheap (you can sometimes tell this and sometimes it looks like it has a budget?!) but there's some really good work in this movie from the actors in it. And it's got a nice groove once it gets going.

I guess even though Nixon is sorta in the background of this movie's lost desert weekend, the ex-president's woes seem just as tragic as the Boxer (Rhomeyn Johnson) and Musician's (Rob Arbogast). Their weird, funny, and troubled vibe is one of the main reasons to see this.

There are no big names in this either, but maybe that's okay in the end since nobody in this has any baggage to ruin it. It makes it feel more real.
