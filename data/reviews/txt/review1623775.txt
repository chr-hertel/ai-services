Having studied this period well, I was shocked to see the historical inaccuracies and fictionalized events this work attempted to tout as "true." It is alarming to think that people actually attempt to learn their history from any religions or cinematic source! What happened to the age when we all read and studied for ourselves, rather than listening to the corner gossips, which is all this "work" amounts to.

This is so over-christianized that it takes itself so seriously as to attempt to beat their ugly lies into anyone who would dare watch.

This was a complete lie. The only thing they got right were the names of those involved.

This was just sad.

It doesn't rate a rating.
