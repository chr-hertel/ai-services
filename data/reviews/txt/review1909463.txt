It wasn't that long ago that I thought M. Night Shyamalan was a genius. However after Lady in the Water and The Happening, I now believe he is a talented filmmaker who caught lightning in a bottle early in his career. Perhaps it is time that M. Night Shyamalan rethinks the notion that he can write, produce, direct and still deliver a quality film every two years. His work is starting to like it has been rushed out the door without fulfilling its potential.

The Village, Lady in the Water, and The Happening all had a workable concept at the core. In all three cases the actors delivered. However at the end of the day it was the writing that brought the films down. It is time that M. Night Shyamalan either quits rushing his half developed ideas into production or brings in someone to help complete his stories.

While watching Lady in the Water, I felt like the actors were improvising at times and making the story up as they went along. I believe this is a result of M. Night Shyamalan making the story up as he went along. The good news is that The Happening is a much better product than Lady in the Water. However, the thoughtful writing that made Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs so enjoyable has all but left the building. The frustrating thing about The Happening is that you get a briefly glimpse of the magic that made M. Night Shyamalan's earlier films so enjoyable. However the magic quickly fizzles. The Happening is simply a compelling idea that fails to play out.

Sad to say it, but I have absolutely no reason to recommend this film.
