SPEAK OF THE DEVIL is one of the most unusual films ever made. There are so many sub plots going on only the brilliant will get it. It is the only film Robert Elarton (one of the most beautiful men in the world) ever made. Do not be fooled by its simplistic nature on the surface.The concepts of good and evil are fought out in the soul of Johna Johnson(Robert Elarton). When he finally comes to terms with the reality of his humanness, he has paid a heavy price. His temptations were never enough to take him to a place where he can never recover, but they indeed change his life forever. This is a must see for detective film lovers. One of the greatest films ever made.
