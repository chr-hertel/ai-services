This is a movie for those of us who just can't get enough back-story to our characters. They probably already knew at this point that the series was coming to an end, so they decided to base this one as much on the past as on the present. See in order to stop the horrible things that's happening in the present, they must undo part of the atrocities that took place back when. In the present Alice and her friends have just graduated high school, and Alice and Dan are planning on traveling around Europe that summer of '89. Those plans are quickly foiled, since Alice finds out that she is pregnant. Again her friends start dying around her, and it's no secret who's behind it. The only question is how he's getting to them, and the answer is inside Alice's belly. It seems that her unborn baby has the same powers as Alice, and he is easy pickings for Freddy. Enter Amanda, Freddy's mom, who informs them of their quest in her usual cryptic way. There's parts of this movie that are really good, and there's parts that are equally bad. The good outweighs the bad by a long way though, and the idea of making it a semi-prequel probably saved the movie as a whole.
