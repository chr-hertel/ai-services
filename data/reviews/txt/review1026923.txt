I have only just seen this film for the first time and as a teenager that has gone through similar things as Liam, I found it brilliant. The acting was good from everyone and the whole story was very well written. It is on the whole a very sad film but Sweet Sixteen is also good because it does provide other small elements such as comedy. It shows the consequences of a young Scottish lad having a poor upbringing and being brought up in a bad environment. Liam is forced into very bad situations and it makes the viewer feel uneasy yet wanting Liam to come out OK. I thoroughly enjoyed this emotional film from start to finish and I hope to watch it many times in the future. You should see this film.
