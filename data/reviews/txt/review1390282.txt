life of David gale, well on first hearing about this movie, i thought it would be a documentary of some gale.

well after i went through the relishing experience of sitting through this wonderful movie, i am all praise for this movie.

David gale is a prof at the university of Texas and is a an activist against the law of capital punishment. well then unfortunate events land the very same David gale on the electric chair, why?, who played the ploy? thats what the movie is about, no vulgar, very well directed awesome movie.

kate winslet and kevin spacey were amazing, fit their characters to perfection.
