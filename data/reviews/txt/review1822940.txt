The God from the Old Testament thought more highly of his non-human creation that He commanded Noah to use the vast majority of His ark to save them from the flood. Having been raised a religious person, it never dawned on me, at least in this Bible story, God was more interested in saving the animal world than in salvaging the human race!

It was apparent that there were plenty of worthy people to save other than Noah's family, and his future daughter-in-laws. The film's writers give us fictionalized examples: No one can deny the goodness of Ruth's mother, or the unnamed peddler. God didn't want other worthy people aboard despite how easy it would have been to rescue them! But God did save the tarantulas and hissing cockroaches!

I'm not justifying this particular God's obvious brutality. A theme which clearly runs through the Noah's Ark story. But it is important for all of us to come to terms with the simple fact: God greatly cherishes ALL of his non-human creation! 

One of my favorite scenes was when a pair of Dodo's, now long extinct by the hands of selfish and foolish men, waddled up the ark's ramp! Another treasured moment was when Noah talks his wife out of throwing the tarantulas and hissing cockroaches out the ark's window, dooming them to extinction! 

Noah said essentially, "everything is interrelated, other creatures depend on them, and what gives you the right to doom any species to extinction?!" I'm sure this went over most viewers heads, but Noah's Ark is first, and foremost, about saving God's creation from extinction! All of it! Not just what is intelligent, pretty, or convenient! This pearl of wisdom is the foundation of the United State's majestic Endangered Species Act. Something which would make the God of the Old Testament very proud, indeed! 

There are plenty of reasons why this film will make fundamentalists, and other religious folks, very unhappy. But, hopefully, saving God's creation, in the here, and now, is not one of them!
