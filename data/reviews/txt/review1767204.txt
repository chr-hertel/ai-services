The documentary tells an accurate story about the American's quest for moon landing. And it does a decent job of educating it's viewers about the history of moon landing. Nothing too special about the storyline itself. However, the documentary provokes the beauty of life. It inspires me, as its viewer, regardless of where I am in life, what my political view is, what my religious view is, to fully appreciate the life I'm living, be grateful of every moment of life, and try to enjoy and make use of every minute of it. I guess it's the significance of moon landing itself, and this documentary effectively conveys it. Very few film today brings such message these days. That's why I scored it high.
