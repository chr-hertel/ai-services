I was on tour with my friend in Budapest. The Concierge was on one of the only two English speaking channels in the hotel. We watched it 5 times in a row. We then went out to eat at a vegetarian restaurant that was also a college. We then played a concert, returned to the hotel and watched it 5 more times! I am not kidding. This movie is terrific and very comforting and nice. See it over and over again like Breaking Away, War Games, Alien or Contempt. MJF is very sincere in this film. I have never forgotten it. Not in the same way I have never forgotten Don't BE AFRAID OF THE DARK! Beware of that movie. This is the perfect MJK film it is like the first BTTF movie or the Frighteners in that it has a sincere cohesion. This is a small unsung film but will be celebrated in the future as a classic.
