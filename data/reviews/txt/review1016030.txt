This movie is going to rewrite the history of Indian Cinema.5 yrs from now this movie will be called an all time Classic.The plus points of the movie are towering performances by all artists including the legendary Amitabh Bachchan.Hats off to the director Mr Sanjay Leela Bhansali for portraying human emotions in a poetic way.Even after watching the movie,the visuals are fresh in your mind.The cinematography by Ravi K Chandran makes you feel you were present along with those characters while the story gets unfolded on the screen.This movie might sweep all awards next yr and might win lot of accolades in all film festivals.The most touching moment which I witnessed in Mumbai after watching the movie was everybody giving a standing ovation.I have never seen something like this in my life.
