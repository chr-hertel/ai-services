The story of Jed Cooper, an innocent man who is hanged by lynchers. Clint Eastwood is great (as usual) as Mr. Cooper and Pat Hingle is awesome as the Judge in this film. Both characters play right off of each other beautifully, this western definitely wanted to make a statement about the growing need for justice in the west and how it would be implemented. This film explores the theme of Hangings and how important they were not only in the name of justice, but weirdly enough, how much of a spectacle they were in 1889 Oklahoma. Eastwoods portrayal of Jed Cooper is the usual calm, swift, and bold character that is reminiscent of Sergio Leone's 'Man With No Name' character from his own Dollars trilogy. Regardless, this is a great movie and Eastwood plus Hingle's performances keep it from bombing completely. A great soundtrack and watch for a few amusing lines throughout the movie, its almost like the precursor to Dirty Harry but in rawhide. 8/10 stars no problem.
