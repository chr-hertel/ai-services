If you like a great Classic film directed by Anthony Mann, who has many credits to his name, "Winchester'73" '50 and Sydney Boehm,"Violent Saturday",'55 you will definitely like this film. The photography and different angles the camera was placed in, were the work of Anthony Mann who was able to create great film stories on a low budget. In this film, Farley Granger,(Joe Norson),"Strangers on a Train", plays a mailman who is tempted beyond words and makes a very bad mistake he will have to live with. His wife is played by Cathy O'Donnell,(Ellen) who is a very loving and trusting wife who thinks the world of her Joe and tells him she is going to have a new addition to their family. Joe wants the very best for Ellen and takes the step to bring into the scene, Paul Kelly,(Capt. Walter Anderson). In the very beginning of this film you will see Aeriel shots of the Manhattan skyline and plenty of car chases in Wall Street, probably shot on a Sunday, with Central Park and downtown Manhattan Hospitals. Great Class film from 1950 !
