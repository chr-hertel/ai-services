Growing up, hearing the word "Hitler" or "Nazi" has always been like somebody saying "Satan" or the "Boogie Man." They are words that define evil, but are more urban legend than a real experience. Bleeding hearts today are naive to think that evil isn't real. Hitler really did exist, and several other Hitler's exist to this day, all over the world and many in our own country.

Those who don't think so should watch this movie ("Hotel Rwanda.")History has already repeated itself and will do so again unless we do something. This movie should be required viewing in schools. It's appalling to me that nobody did ANYTHING to stop this. One battalion of marines could have ended all that. President Clinton did nothing. He could have sent the marines in but didn't feel that would help him in the polls for whatever reason. He DID NOTHING. The United States Congress DID NOTHING. The blood of these 1 million people is partially on their hands.

All it takes for evil to triumph is that good men do nothing. Evil triumphed in Rwanda.
