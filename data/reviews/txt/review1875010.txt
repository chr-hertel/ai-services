Cobra is either 80's action as its worst or its best, depending on the way you look at it. There really is no need to speak about plot, as this movie makes as much sense as, well, blind watching a TV. There's nothing in the film that could be describer as logic or sense in the story; it just happens and you are amazed of the lack of intelligence.

If you can name a clich√©, the changes are that Cobra has it. There's bad blood between cops, traitors and nonsense murderers. There even is silly sidekick, and "clever" throws. And it all is crowned with a classic 80's soundtrack of the hottest bands of the hour. And yet I couldn't care less.

The bottom line is, Cobra is garbage. Idiotic piece of trash action directed in the midst of the 80's. A movie that would have been better left undone.

Score: 2/10. The film is just too illogical and the actors do very bad job, but really, no one could lift the script into any level of adequacy.

Camp value: 7/10. The ending speech by the Nightslaher alone is such a camp moment, that if it doesn't make you laugh nothing will.
