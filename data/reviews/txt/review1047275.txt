I LOVE this movie!! I remember seeing it many times growing up and since I bought the DVD recently I have become obsessed with it. First of all, the music and lyrics are wonderful. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice make a great team for the soundtrack. The songs are so memorable and the performances are terrific. Ted Neely is excellent as Jesus. His voice is awesome. He has an amazing vocal range. He is my favorite Jesus by far! My favorite scene is the Gethsemane song where Jesus is confessing that he is having doubts about dying. Its just another example of why this movie is so good. Besides the great music and performances, the perspectives that it takes on are so original. I love how it portrays Jesus as being human and having problems dealing with his fame and destiny. Carl Anderson's performance is perfect! Judus' point of view is one we rarely see in this way. He's always the bad apostle that betrayed Jesus but here I can sympathize with his character and I understand his motives. The setting is gorgeous and I love how modern elements like guns, tanks, etc, are used as well as their different costumes. It makes an interesting effect on feel of the movie - a combination of the serious themes and the fun of the musical aspect without losing a sense that it was written as a stage show. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, especially if you love musicals and good storytelling. Its definitely a classic!
