It's almost sad to tear into Richard Kelly's utter and epic sci-fi mistake of a follow up to an evidently lucky debut. For his unwavering commitment to this ridiculous futuristic-but-modern (a tone that made no intuitive sense at all) absurdity alone, with all of its delusional political undertones, the man must have convictions.

For the first few minutes alone one might want to believe that the overwhelming negativity hurled at this movie and it's eventual "trimmed" 144 minute cut might not be your opinion as well (the prequel alternate-universe timetable was at least somewhat engaging). Kelly actually manages to hold the suspense of talent for that long...then it is all downhill, (besides for the occasionally sharp sex-obsessed society observation) and straight down; with each mystical new detail revealed, you will likely care about this self-absorbed script's relevance even less if you are in fact watching objectively and not pre-enrolled into the cult of Darko. 

Wonder why the cast seems like literally the worst ensemble fathomable? That is not some clever Tarantino-like b-list casting, these are the only people who would put their names on it - this unintentional parody of a bloated apocalyptic mess is that misguided.
