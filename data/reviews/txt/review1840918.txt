Really? The surgeon General's Warning on the back of a pack of cigarettes has more substance than the plot of this movie. The characters are, at best, one dimensional. And the cherry on top of this terrible-movie-sundae is the fact that is a slap in the face to both history and known geography.

If you have any inclination whatsoever to see this movie please do yourself a favor sit down and watch-Apocalypto, 300, and Clan of the Cavebear while forcibly hitting yourself in the forehead with a hammer. This should have about the same effect of having to endure 109 minutes of 10,000 B.C.
