When the final movie is filmed and the list of the greatest movies of all time is released it is safe to say that Pathfinder will be nowhere to be seen. This is as it should be though, the director of Pathfinder wasn't setting out to make art. You won't finish this movie and be inspired to change the world, you won't look for this at the next Oscars. You might however be inspired to strap on every pot and pan in your kitchen and pretend to be a Viking.

This is the gift of Pathfinder. In a world where every movie is expected to say something, win something or bring in more money than God, Pathfinder says NO. Instead Pathfinder says sit down, switch off and enjoy the ride. Huge scary Vikings attack Native Americans and it is up to Ghost, a Viking child abandoned by his own people and raised by the Native Americans to turn the tide in a series of great set pieces.

You'll wish there was a toy line for the characters so they can take on your treasured Clash of the Titans action figures in a battle to the finish. This is a fun movie that you'll look back on fondly in years to come, but get the Unrated edition because, well, more gore is always a good thing.

The performances are all solid and Karl Urban appears to be the inheritor of the Kurt Russell gift of aging to suit the movie you are in. This film is lots and lots of fun and this unashamed style of movie making deserves to be supported.
