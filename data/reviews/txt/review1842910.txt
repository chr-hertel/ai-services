A charming retelling of a Dr. Seuss classic tale, mixed in with Jim Carrey and Steve Carell humor. The Story begins with a lovable friendly elephant named Horton(Jim Carrey), one day finds a speck on a clover , he begins to think that there is something living in it, but the other animals thinks he is crazy, turns out he's right. There is a town in it called Who-ville, and the only one that hears him is The Mayor(Steve Carell), who is shock to find out he is smaller then a tick. Horton is determined to get the speck safety, but will he make before it is too late? An enjoyable film for kids and adults, It fairs better then The Grinch(2000) and The Cat In The Hat(2003). The Animation was awesome too. For parents and kids, please don't miss this one.
