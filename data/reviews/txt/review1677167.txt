What an array of tough "macho" guys who do not have to steadily curse and swear because there is a story to tell and their actions speak louder than words.

Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Robert Vaughn, Charles Bronson and James Coburn all shine bright as stars because they blend together mellifluously without strain, competition or conflict. What a beautiful screenplay as well. The music is stupendous, Elmer Bernstein at his finest. Whenever you see grand scenery in a western you can always hear the musical theme to this film pounding away in the back of your mind. The action is explosive and truly exciting. The suspense is riveting. Eli Wallach is something else as Calvera, the Bandit, who leads forty (40) desperadoes against Seven (7) heroic men who are at the end of a violent gunslinging era who are trying to find justification and meaning to their lives. Their lot is to defend helpless and poor farmers against the raids of Calvera in an attempt to redeem themselves from a purposeless life.

A sensational movie that is a true "Classic." One to own.
