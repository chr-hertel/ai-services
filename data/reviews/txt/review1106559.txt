I went to see Batman Begins today and was shocked to see that Catwoman had only 3.4 compared to Batman Begins's 8.something. I had a lot more fun watching Catwoman because I think that's what the producers had in mind when they made it, a fun movie. But not only is it fun, it has a lot of good action, the movie moves along at a good pace, keeps you involved and gives you a lot of laughs when you need them. In my opinion these superhero movies should be like the comic books they came from, easy to look at, simple yet detailed story and most importantly, FUN. The Hulk, Spiderman, Daredevil, and Catwoman all did a great job of bringing the comic books to life.
