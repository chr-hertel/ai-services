I guess most people have heard that this movie is very funny. It is what you would expect from the people involved in this movie, all the way to Ben Stiller helping produce the movie. A lot of good one liners are in this movie as well as a lot of physical comedy. I liked it a lot. Anyone who goes to see this will not be disappointed. There are a lot of Ferrell and Heder haters out there, and that is fine, but then just don't go see this movie then because you probably do not have a sense of humor and wont get the jokes anyway. I hope anyone else who goes to see it enjoys its comedy, and i do think that most people who are going to see this movie know exactly what to expect.
