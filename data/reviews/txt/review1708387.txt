Gangsters hang in the nicest looking places. "His Kind of Woman" never, for me, becomes what it looks like it should be. It's just too long and complicated. I couldn't focus on any one plot or character. I found Vincent Price, Jane Russell, and the settings enjoyable. I wish I could say they were distracting from a potentially great story - but, there is no cohesive story to match these surroundings.

I don't think I have seen Mr. Mitchum drop a cigarette down the from of another thug's pants before - the guy seems to get over it quickly, so I guess it was a mild burn...

Mr. Price asks Mr. Mitchum, at one point, "How come you don't drink?" 

Huh?
