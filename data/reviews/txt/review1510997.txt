Okay, so, we bought this on DVD with the first Baby Geniuses, thought it would be good.

Boy were we wrong.

This is the first movie in which me and my family actually TURNED OFF a quarter of the way through. It just wasn't funny at all. It was awful, absolutely awful.

Although, little (3 year olds) like this movie, so it's a nice thing to have on hand to waste two hours of your little kid's life...if you feel willing to pay $10 to get it.

My advice: don't see, get or rent this movie.
