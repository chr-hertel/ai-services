I just looked at the breakdown of voting and found it amusing the number of people who gave this movie a 1 out of 10. I am grateful that this topic was broached. Whether or not this movie is 100% factual without any propaganda, I do not know. Very few could doubt, however, that this was all propaganda. I find it ironic that those who usually pride themselves as being "open-minded" and "in-touch" are those who have immense sarcasm/hatred and usually fear that a topic like intelligent design is even considered. Why not be open to all scientific arguments? Lets not let our pride or fear that we may actually be wrong keep us from discovering the truth.
