This film made me cry. But in a bad way. I was so upset that I watched the first 20 minutes of this film that I walked outside, and fell on the floor, and looked at the sky, saying to myself, "why isn't Tom Green on Death Row?" Tom Green has made the worst movie ever and he should have been arrested for this degoratory insult and embarrassment to film-making worldwide. Not only is it so offensive, but it is so expectionally dumb, so incredibly disgusting and so unacceptably mean and bizarre(that is all a description of Tom Green, and I am being more than generous.)There is nothing good about this film, and this film is a totally new form of abysmal film-making. In fact, this isn't film-making. This is a message from Tom Green saying, @#%! the whole world This is a waste of even a bad movie fan's time. I beg you, do not even waste 1/100 of a second on this atrocity of a film. Just let it die and rot a cinematic death it deserves. And that is being generous. This film is a good and much needed end to Tom Green's career on making extremely offensive garbage. This film is the worst film ever created by man. And that is saying it in the nicest way possible.
