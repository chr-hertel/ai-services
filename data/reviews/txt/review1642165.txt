This time taking on Rambo, Harley takes his team into the deserts of the Middle East to save...someone. This is a very good parody, and ranks almost as good as the original Hot Shots, although it is only a tad lesser due to having lost the virtue of freshness. There are so many Rambo movies, that after a while, it was like they were making fun of themselves.

However, this work is quite funny, entertaining, silly, and lovable. The characters are as enjoyable the second time around, and the gags work. As with the original installment of this run, they aren't Mel Brooks-worthy, but they still work even though they walk up to the bell, but seem afraid to ring it.

It sometimes seems a shame to see Charlie Sheen doing work like this, instead of something more meaningful.

It rates a 7.6/10 from...
