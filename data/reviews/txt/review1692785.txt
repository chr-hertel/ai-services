This is not a great Franco film nor even a great sex film but it is still likable enough. Fantastic settings and enough 'action' to keep most happy. We don't really get an orgy, merely two couples in adjacent areas peeping at each other. In fact this final scene is probably the film's worst. For some reason both couples are placed in incredibly uncomfortable positions which they struggle to get out of and the desired 'peeping' looks more as if they are not approving of one another. There are some very good scenes, however, and the ironic and completely over the top narrative from the 'noble Spaniard' really is funny. He tells us it is useful to have a woman so there is someone to jerk off the servants and that he prefers his dog because at least he is a thoroughbred! The young female visitor is also raped by a couple of native Spaniards because 'that's what they come here for'. So not your everyday soft core but Franco fans will know what to expect
