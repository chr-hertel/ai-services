Billy Bob Thorton stars as Willie T. Stokes, a foul-mouthed alcoholic and part-time criminal who annually fills the boots of the mall Santa Claus with his petty thief sidekick Marcus (Tony Cox) in the cynical holiday comedy "Bad Santa". Every year they slip into a new town and a new mall undetected, leaving with a whole mess of cash. This year Willie finds himself with his biggest set of hurdles yet with the head of mall security growing highly suspicious of him, a slow-witted kid hanging onto the assumption that Willie is really Santa Claus, and a hot bartender with a Santa fetish.

Thornton comes fully armed with every repulsive trick in the book in his portrayal of Willie. This may well be Thornton at his funniest. Lauren Graham shines with her role as the sexy love interest, Sue, a 180 degree turn from her goodie-goodie character on TV's "Gilmore Girls". Bernie Mac as the vain, cowboy hat wearing, head of mall security chews up every scene he's in.

At long last there's a holiday film that doesn't condescend with truckloads of false good cheer, and an unreal universe where one month a year everyone suddenly cares about everyone else. For those adults bored with watching visual cotton candy every holiday "Bad Santa" delivers the kitty.
