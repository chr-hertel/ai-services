I first heard of this movie in a Steven Sodheim song book that I have which one of the songs was in, an amazing song called "Take Me To the World". I got a vague idea of the plot by listening to the songs and from what I could piece together from the internet and also the very helpful posting on IMDb (thank you whoever wrote that). Anyway it inspired me enough to go and see the film at the Museum of TV and Radio in NYC, an I have to say that it was worth it. While the casting creeped me out a little bit (a combo of leads from the Sound of Music and Psyco falling in love-- a little weird). The acting was good enough to make me forget about that and exceptionally well done for a made-for-TV musical from the 50s. While the quality was crappy even at the museum, I would love to get my hands on any copy of this as well and the plot (even though slightly creepy) and music are something that should be honored and possibly even remade. This was definitely worth the trip to NYC for me and I live in Seattle!!!
