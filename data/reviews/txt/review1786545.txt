Very nasty satire on the problems with having a single vision when approaching the art - and business - of film-making.

Most of it is quite good - neatly written, acted, filmed, and nicely paced.

The film has a big weakness - Christopher Walken. He plays the same character he has played for the past 15 years, and frankly, I've had enough of it. I won't tell the whole story here - but his character should have been offed in the first third of the movie. Unfortunately, that character is pivotal - and that's a big mistake - he's too slimly to carry this film, he drags it down.In the bit with the IRS accountant, nicely played by executive producer Martin Scorcese, I couldn't help thinking of the brilliant, and long forgot, comedy "A New Leaf" with Walter Matthau. And there are enough chops in the script, and among the other actors, to have produced a film to rival that one.

But it's the same old same old Christopher Walken, isn't it? Pretty good - but could have been better.
