There is so much wrong with this one,I almost have no idea where to start...First of all, nice to see Calsista put on some weight again, and made the incredible transformation from a 35 kg bag of bones to a 50 kg bag of bones... Her acting is as weak as her figure; In this movie she switches between severely underacted scenes, to a panicky sort of over-acting. Her screams and fear come across as totally unrealistic. I simply do not believe her when she does the panicky-thing... The story is weak, and takes enormous leaps and leaves gaps that gave me the feeling they were either in a hurry to write the script or just could n't care less. Well writing good horror is not easy, and believe me, this one defeinately fall into that category. The moments that were supposed to be scary, I could see them coming from miles away, and I think the major flaw was in the delivery. No tension was built up anywhere, and when they made kind of a half-baked attempt, they just couldn't deliver. What they did succeed in though, was in delivering a constant stream of cliché after cliché. Another waste of my time...

Scary? Hahahah don't make me laugh...
