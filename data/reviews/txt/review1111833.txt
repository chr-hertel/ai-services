"You're the cutest mouse in the joint." Its lines like that which make "The Youngest Profession" a classic. This is film isn't seen enough. I saw it the first time on TCM and was absolutely hooked. I'm a HUGE William Powell fan, and quite identified with a young girl's fascination with the debonair actor. Had I been a teen in 1943, I'd have been collecting autographs when stars were stars. Virginia Weidler gains a few John Hancocks by the end of the film which is littered with cameos by William Powell, Lana Turner, Greer Garson, Walter Pigeon, and Robert Taylor. This is a fantastically funny movie and if you're looking for something along the lines of "The Thin Man", "Bringing Up Baby" and other classics of the era, "The Youngest Profession" should quench your thirst.
