Jeremiah Johnson is the epic saga of a man who doesn't want to be part of a civilizing world and heads to the mountains to be a...well, mountain man. What he's searching for is never all that clear, not even to himself. "A mountain man is a lonely man" says the song and that does seem to apply to all the characters here.

As Jeremiah learns the tricks to survive up in the mountains he encounters quite a few people and ends up gaining a family. But life in the wilderness is harsh and in more ways than Jeremiah may have thought.

An exceptionally beautiful film to look at and with a captivating story, Jeremiah Johnson is a great film in most respects. Shot entirely in Utah, the scenery looks so great you almost wanna pack up your bags and head to the mountains before the credits end.

It's also well written I think. Jeremiah goes through a lot and ends up with plenty of wisdom and experience but whether that's a good thing or not is up to viewers. Redford is excellent, doesn't talk all that much but conveys a lot through gestures and looks. Really good actor. Everybody else does good also, I particularly liked his wife and "adopted" boy.

Plenty of action as well, as Jeremiah has quite a few brawls with some Indians. Overall Jeremiah Johnson is overflowing with good things to say about it but somehow lacks the touch of greatness. It's irritating when you can't quite put your finger on it.
