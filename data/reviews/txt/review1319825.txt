This Movie is one of the best movies i HAVE seen. Douglas is Great " We have serious problem and we need serious people to solve them"... J. Fox is great in this film as well. Along with Michael Sheen. I highly recommend this film to anyone who like politics movies. I love these types of movies ones that have a good plot and background The director who made this movie should do a sequel to it like for the elections and the 2nd terms and him and Syd getting married. I am thinking that a sequel to this film with all the original people would be very cool to see. I also like Jaine who was the personal aide to the president, she did a very good job in this movie, it a lot of work to be a personal aide to the president i would assume.
