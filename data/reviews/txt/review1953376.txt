Unfortunately the information on Joan Young who plays Susan Granville is totally wrong. The bio has her being born in 1903. This episode from 1959 has her at about twenty!! Obviously a different person.

I have written IMDb but have been ignored.

This episode, and Waco Williams are my all time favorite Mavericks. "You sure he can count all the way to ten, Colonel?"

Wonderful ENCORE TV is now showing all the Mavericks in order, every day at 6PM. DON"T MISS A ONE!

Now all we have to do is wait for them to come out on DVD.

Plys all the other Warner Bros TV shows from the fifties.
