I have fond memories of 'Ator the fighting eagle' from the VHS version i saw as a teen in the eighties. Whatever happened to the great tradition of low budget barbarian films? Today you see try hard films with reasonable cgi effects but shockingly bad performances, and scripts that are usually anachronistic and too self aware (blame TV's Hercules and Xena for this?). The problem I think is the filmmakers of today take themselves too seriously. Make a low budget film and be proud of it, 'Ator' is not impressive on any technical front but it is sure as hell entertaining. This film isn't trying to be 'Conan' any more than a daytime TV soap is trying to be serious drama. it is what it is, if you can't deal with that then don't watch coz you just won't get it. If you can then you'll have a fun hour and a half.
