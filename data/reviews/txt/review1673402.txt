I think that the movie is very exciting and thrilling. Some plot of the movie is really touching, especially the character of the movie Solomon Vandy tries to persuade his son Dia Vandy to put down the gun in his hand. The words that Solomon says to him really touch me. Another plot that touches me is the character of the movie Danny Archer sacrifices his life for Solomon Vandy and his son. When I saw he saying goodbye to them and Maddy Bowen, I felt very sad and it really touched me. I think the movie is an excellent movie, it reflects the society problem of blood diamond. Some people kill others for blood diamond or money. I felt sad after I saw the movie. The film lets me realize that there are many people now suffering from the war of blood diamond. I hope that the blood diamond won't be appeared anymore.
