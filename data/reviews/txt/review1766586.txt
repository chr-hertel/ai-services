The only redeeming thing about the movie is the star/roving reporter. The typical behavior of the uneducated, disrespectful liberal crowd outside the 2004 RNC was embarrassing for all Americans who actually respect the law. They felt disobeying rules and warnings for their own safety was an act of protest. They had the right to continue of they cleared the streets and they failed so that got what they deserved. Dissent doesn't mean being an ass, but today's protesters think exactly that. You want to disagree and dissent, I'm all for it, but be a grown up and obey the law. Otherwise, you become the type of people who don't deserve respect, attention or citizenship.
