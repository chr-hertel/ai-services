The movie was great. I was impacted emotionally so much that I felt very depressed for two weeks. I was feeling the same sadness that Ennis was going thru. I felt in love with Jack as deep as Ennis felt... and then left the movie with a complete sadness. I went back and I saw it again... then I learned new things...it is true, is nature's call...so powerful. It is a movie that makes you come back to see it again. I wish they would release the DVD's with subtitles in Spanish. It is only being shown in English with no subtitles. I have been thru the same experience in my life and very well understand the things we have to hide and the lies we have to tell to keep dear ones and friends happy toward me. I have met many men passing thru this situation... a secret in their lives.
