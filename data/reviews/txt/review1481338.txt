Being a classic cult-film of the vampire-genre, LiquidSky has a brother and sister couple explore their love for each other while coping with their addictions to sex, food, alcohol and each other as well as to the people around them.

One has to be a true-fan to acknowledge the sister-brother-relationship of the main-character(s) who love each other until they turn physically into identical-twins.

The story of their "hiding" until the effect of their love wears off leaves the viewer wondering what the story is really about sometimes while others see it as aliens in tiny-ships taking the excess biological-products from the bodies of addicts.

The "wall-scene" in the movie has the kneeling-brother showing that his standing-sister is loved no matter what environment they live in together under any physical-gender held.

The movie is sometimes remembered along side the musical "Hair" which stars the twin-daughters from LiquidSky's director.

The daughters Snap & Whistle are from the director of LiquidSky and from one of the leads in LiquidSky, the kneeling-brother-twin.

A cult classic!
