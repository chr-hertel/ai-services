This critique is based on familiarity with the movie and knowing the era in which it was produced. "Guess Who's..." provides a passive perspective on the most perfect Black man marrying the most perfect White woman in American society in the late 60s. As such, it's painful to watch the characters' superficial angst. Don't misunderstand: I've always liked this movie. It's just that lines that avow there would be no real marriage without children bother me, especially when only 30 years hence, many women will discover that bearing children won't be so easy; that 10 years hence, women supporting their husbands' career won't be considered good enough for Gloria, Bella, and their ilk; that a couple of years after this movie came out, women were expected to make their own individual mark and forget about any teamwork involved in making a difference with whomever. This perspective can be painful for those of us who did not achieve mainstream "success." And certain fundamental beliefs of this movie--e.g., kids should expect their parents to be loving and supportive and provide them with every advantage--may not be realistic. Sigh. On a happier note: This movie reminds me of campaigning in the town of Princeton, NJ, for Hubert Humphrey at the age of 12. Hmm, come to think of it, that just about sums it up.
