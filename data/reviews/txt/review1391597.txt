I have a feeling that the reason this film isn't doing very well has more to do with the ad campaign, which suggests it is a comedy. It has its funny moments, lots of them, but it also has scenes of almost pain inducing drama. I can only think of "Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?" with Taylor/Burton when I last saw two people tear into each other with such vitriol.

I kept wondering where Jennifer Anniston learned how to go for the throat like that...

Having been in relationships that included arguments like the ones shown in this movie, and having been one of the unfortunate audience members in real life when other couples have had similar arguments, I can say that while the fights ring true, they are sometimes too real for a 10 rating.

What is missed in the complaints of the ending, though, is the dead on comedy in the film. There are moments not only Laugh Out Loud, but long, continued and building laughter... one joke runs into another, then another, and when the jokes start jamming, the facial expressions take the comedy to another level.
