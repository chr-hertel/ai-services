I went to this movie on a date expecting it to be some sort of chick flick. WRONG! Well in some places MAYBE but it was so funny. The writer of this movie had to be absolute genius and the actor is the ONLY one who could have pulled it off. If you love to laugh YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE. A 6.3 average rating is NOT good enough. It should be a 9.9 or higher. To say the least these types of movies usually disappoint me. You know by showing all the funny moments on the trailers. Well this one surprised me by not showing hardly anything! Great experience and a must see! I'm one line short and believe that is a stupid rule to be able to submit this but I will restate this movie is great, this site maybe not so much a user friendly environment.
