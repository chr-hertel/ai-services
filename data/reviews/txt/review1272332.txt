Reese Witherspoon out did herself in this one and Mark Ruffalo was so wonderful!! Their chemistry is great! The whole story made me laugh, cry, sit on the edge of my seat holding my breath just hoping it all worked out...it was awesome! I cannot wait to own this one when it comes out! LOVED IT! LOVED IT! LOVED IT!! The plot was genius really...and the one guy from Napoleon Dynamite, though having a small part, really added to this one...very memorable! I loved the relationships between her sister and her nieces and Loved the ending! I won't spoil it for you, but it will keep you all wrapped up in the movie until the very end...sweet sweet movie!
