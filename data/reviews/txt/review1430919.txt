I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as i do all of his films. One of my friends said something to me afterwards that i want to repeat here. Shyamalan doesn't create movies for the masses. He creates movies for the few people who have high enough intelligence to get things out of them. He put his soul into that movie and you have to be at a certain level of intelligence and maturity to be able to understand the workings of a genius. I think its the same way with a lot of his movies. The sixth sense was, i think, the least like that, i mean, it was made more for the masses. I think that the more he has lived out his career the more personal and intense his movies get. It makes you wonder what his next movie is going to be like.
