Hi... I'm not a fan of Arabic movies, and you'll never find me at the movies waiting in line to buy a ticket to watch an Arabic movie, but I've heard so much about this movie that I decided to give it a try, and now after watching it I can honestly say that I have never laughed this much in a movie, It was VERY VERY VERY funny, and I'm still remembering bits of the movie and laughing about them... I've seen Helmi before in some lead roles but none of them is like this role, although it is the typical " silly funny good guy whose trying to do everything right " role, but this time he's done a great performance with lots of wit and humor. I also loved the little girl, she's really gifted and her acting comes out naturally.
