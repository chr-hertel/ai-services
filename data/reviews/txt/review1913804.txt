The problem with this movie is not the performances (Well it sort of is) or even the direction, but the terrible writing. It's billed as a Disney Channel Original Movie, but it doesn't feel like a movie. It feels like a bunch of clich√©d scenes from other movies made into a Frankenstein-ish monster. This "movie" is a beast to sit through and the only reason it is so popular with little girls is because of the abundant amount of screen time for Joe Jonas.

Mitchie (Demi Lovato) is finally able to live out her dream and go to a rock camp for the rich, all thanks to her mom taking the job as cook at the camp. Mitchie becomes friends with popular girls, but of course, they mistreat her. Shane Grey (Joe Jonas) is a rock star who is known as a bad boy, and in order to reinvent his image, he becomes a dance instructor at Camp Rock. Shane and Mitchie meet and they "fall in like". Stupidity ensues.

I can say, I'm quite glad they didn't try making this a comedy, because all Disney comedies fall flat on their butt to everyone except 12 year old girls (and younger). The songs are pretty run of the mill, and none are particularly good. The acting isn't terrible, but at times various things are annoying about them. Demi Lovato smiles way too much, over everything. She's either somber or super happy, maybe she should invent a happy medium look in herself. Joe Jonas acts like he's sad in one scene, but his acting is laughable. As mentioned earlier, the plot is not anything new, but a bunch of elements of after school specials and bad kiddie movies mixed together to make this. It is genuinely boring, and sadly, fails in comparison to the extremely lame High School Musical movies.

Overall, this is bad. Don't see it. This doesn't apply to little kids with no sense of good. They'll enjoy it somehow anyways.

My rating: * out of ****. 85 mins. Not rated
