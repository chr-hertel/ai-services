Well this has got to be the single worst movie I have ever watched. I am Russian and I couldn't believe this crap. This movie takes advantage of every single Russian stereotype and it does so without any skill or taste. Acting literally sucked. Special effects..... WHAT SPECIAL EFFECTS!? I thought this movie couldn't have got any worst until I saw the helicopter scene at the end of the movie. That scene left me sitting there with my mouth half open in disbelief that someone thought that was a good idea. This is as low budget as they get. If on certain night you find yourself desperate for some entertainment and just happen to have a copy of this movie laying around might I suggest finding a nice brick wall and just bang your head on it for an hour or so... I think you will find that a whole lot more satisfying
