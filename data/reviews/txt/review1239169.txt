I saw this movie when I was 12 years old and really enjoyed it. I am pretty sure I would also enjoyed it now as an adult but I have been wrong before with movies that I liked as a child. I have looked for it but have not been able to find it so far. I would really like my children to watch it. It really scared me and made me cry a lot. The hyena chased me in my dreams for a while. Does anybody know where I can buy it or rent it ? I saw this movie when I was 12 years old and really enjoyed it.
