Directed by Alexander Payne (About Schmidt, Citizen Ruth, Election) made an excellent, laughter-filled dramatic comedy with superb performances by the cast.

Director Payne and Screenwriter Jim Talyor (Jurassic Park 3) won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. Which the picture is based on a novel by Rex Pickett. This exhilaration movie is a smart, funny and touching. This was one of the most critical acclaimed films of 2004. This is worth seeing. (**** Â½/*****).
