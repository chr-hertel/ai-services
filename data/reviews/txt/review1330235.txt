(PLOT SPOILER FREE!) Reading the various user reviews of "The Promise", it's apparent that a lot of people dislike the movie for the wrong reasons - most write how the movie compares unfavorably to Chen's earlier works like "The Emperor and the Assassin", "Farewell My Concubine", "Yellow Earth", etc. Anybody who's seen those movies would obviously know that it's unfair to make a comparison between "The Promise" and a movie like "Farewell My Concubine", akin to comparing apples to oranges. After all, nobody writes reviews comparing "Chronicles of Narnia" to "Kingdom of Heaven" and starts bashing "Narnia" for having a talking lion! "The Promise" is clearly meant to be enjoyed as a cinematic fairytale / fantasy movie, not a semi-realistic film such as "Farewell My Concubine" or even wuxia movies like "Crouching Tiger" or "House of Flying Daggers" (both of which for obvious reasons lack magic spells, prophecy spewing goddesses, and time travel). Better movies to compare "The Promise" to would be fairytale / fantasy movies like "Narnia" or "LOTR", because "The Promise", beneath is fantasy plot of warrior-nobleman, an enchanted princess, and a mysterious stranger is a parable about love, trust, deception, lies, and sacrifice. True, "The Promise" isn't quite perfect in its execution of its movie elements - the characters sometimes behave illogically, the story may be too complicated for people to follow, the Mandarin Chinese is uneven among the actors - but still, I found the movie to be compelling when I viewed as a fairytale and NOT as a serious historical drama or an action-packed wuxia film.

Outwardly, this fable of a movie may seem ill-fitting to Chen's resume, but beneath surface, I found the moral questions in "The Promise" to be consistent with those that other Chen Kaige films often covertly pose...

Give this movie a chance, watch it with an open mind, and you just might be pleasantly surprised at what you may find.
