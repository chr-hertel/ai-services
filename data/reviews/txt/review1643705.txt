When a film like this is used in history class, when talking about Christianity in ancient Rome, then I do think that there is something going wrong! It is not at all historically accurate, but some kind of Christian propaganda! Of course Christians were persecuted these days but so were many religious or other groups. Of course they were forced to fight in the arena. But not all of them! 

I laughed throughout the whole movie... although I doubt that it was supposed to be funny. Butwhen Saint Peter saw this cross of light shining through a tree and this blue-eyed lad, who seemed like a boy-toy, said these "God-sent"-words.... That was just too stupid and too absurd not to burst out laughing! 

Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the scene where the emperor's counsel and his mistress cut their artery and then talked on and on and on....

well.... probably it deserves better ratings! A great comedy!
