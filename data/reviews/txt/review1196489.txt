I have neither read nor seen the play this film is based on, but Mike Nichols does not attempt to take "Closer" outside the parameters of a filmed play. I don't mind that technique, Nichols has filmed many a play and he is so very good at it. Any problem the film may have is likely a reflection of the play itself. I'm guessing that Mike Nichols did more with this play than any other stage director could. I happen to really like plays about relationships between men and women, but I had the sense that the dialog was a bit too influenced by David Mamet. While the play's ideas and narrative were fine and thoughtful, I think it would have been a better play if it wasn't so derivative of Mamet. Only Mamet should do Mamet, and this playwright would have been better off using his own voice. "Closer" is an example of how a great director and great performances can elevate a play that is good enough, but maybe not as good as these players' skill at interpreting it.
