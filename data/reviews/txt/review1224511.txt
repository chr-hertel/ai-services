This is truly one of the worst pieces of cinema it has ever been my misfortune to be exposed to. I find it quite difficult to understand how anyone can say much good about this waste of time. True: the choreography of the cabaret scenes was fine and Tim Roth gave a spirited performance, but the lack of historical accuracy, the pathetic acting, the incredible lack of interesting content, and poor writing make this a very very sad piece of work indeed. Frankly, it seems that many people feel guilty about pointing out how bad this movie is. Perhaps this is understandable, but it does not change the simple fact that this stinks on a very grand scale.
