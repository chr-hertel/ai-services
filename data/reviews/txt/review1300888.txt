I first saw it on HBO when I was 12. I personally thought it was great. It may have had it faults but I loved the fashion and the transformation. I thought it had a good ending to very heartfelt. The only actor in the movie I recognized was that lady that played in Polthergeist.Weird. But sometimes underrated films are the best films. But NOT ALWAYS. Its faults could have been the singing outbursts I never like them in a movie and I think they could have gotten someone better to play the popular guy, I don't even know who that guy is??? But I knew who Robyn Lively was because she played in the Karate Kid Part 3. Anyways a memorable movie for me very fun, and edgy.
