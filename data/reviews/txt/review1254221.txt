Never been a Julia Roberts fan until this movie. She looks great in this movie. She sure has won me over. Who want's coffee and a piece of bunt cake? Erin's hand goes up right now and Ed says they have to go. Erin quickly straightens him out and he says "I love bunt cake". This movie is better the second time you watch it because it does'nt drag and is fun from start to finish. Didn't care too much for George. Kind of hard to believe a biker would be such a great family man and would want to be a baby sitter. Don't think he would have volunteered if the lady would have not been a beauty queen. It's always fun to watch an intelligent women lead a man around by the the nose. Seen it many times and enjoy it every time. Fun to see David beat Goliath. It was also fun at the end to see Ed finally shut Erin's mouth. It was really neat to see the real Erin Brockovich and Ed Masry in the diner scene. As for Julia Roberts being a great actress, in the scene where Pete Jensen is throwing rocks at P G&E in the middle of the night we then focus on Erin in the house with Donna. Donna sobbing asks Erin to go get them. Erin is looking at Donna and couldn't say a word lest she would start weeping. The look on Erin's face and the nod she gives Donna speaks volumes without saying a word. As Tony The TIger would say "greeeeeeeeeat"! She is the greatest right behind Sandra Bullock.
