Sorry but I consider this a well crafted thriller based on an award-winning stage play. Yes, I found it extremely difficult to watch and even considered leaving. But there is no denying that Ashley Judd and Michael Shannon deserve Academy awards for acting in this film. For all you horror fans out there - this was not a movie about giant killer bugs and if you movie-goers show up at a theater with no idea what you are about to see, that is your problem. Don't blame the studios. Have you never seen a trailer before? Don't you watch TV or read the newspaper or magazines. There is plenty of publicity out there to educate the public about what an upcoming movie is about. In closing I would like to go on record for all of you Alfred Hitchcock worshiping fans - Hitchcock was a hack. Yes, he did indeed create a couple of good films. But on a whole his films were rather mediocre with endings that went no where. If he were new on the scene today he would never make it.
