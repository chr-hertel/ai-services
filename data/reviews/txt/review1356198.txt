....while I was watching it.....I now realize, after reading so many other commentaries, that I was fascinated by the graphic assault of it. Now, I am so happy I did not see this in a theater - it is a film to experience alone.

Some of the film is too true to endure.....there ARE areas of Los Angeles where it's safer to sleep on the floor....where people are not safe on the streets....where few people show compassion for others.... where poverty and blight prevent the residents from climbing out.... where merely living day-to-day is so difficult - yet, there isn't any other city I'd like to live in. I wonder if all those who wrote such negative commentaries are doing anything to make it better.

All of the actors/actresses delivered their best - the sound was ponderous and crisp, the cinematography was excellent - the stories were believable which one could relate to, perhaps too easily if you live in Los Angeles - all of this made me yearn for the sweet story of "City of Angels" - does anyone remember its quiet revelations, or believe it is - or could be - that way? No matter how healing the end of "Crash" was supposed to be, it was too weak to relieve the demolition it portrayed....
