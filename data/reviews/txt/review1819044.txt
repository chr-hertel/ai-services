A friend from worked showed a group of us this film on a crappy VHS tape, and was I blown away by how great it was. It's suppose to be a student film, but the story, acting and cinematography is better then I have seen in a while. And I have seen some bad production in student films, but not this one they must have had some dough to pour into it. I read the review and I have to agree the acting was flawless. I was wishing though that I could see more of the back-story of all the characters, cause how do people get to that point? I loved all the characters but especially creepy Ben, that guy was a freak in disguise. This movie made want to see every film noir I could get my hands on. It's not for sale cause it's a student film but if you get a chance to see it do it. Its weird 6 people in totaled voted before me and 5 people gave it a 9 or 10, yet it's score is 1 star, crazy. GREAT FILM! T
