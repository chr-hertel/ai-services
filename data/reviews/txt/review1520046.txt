This video not only encourages Montessori students to explore featured activities in the classroom, it is appropriate for children attending any preschool or staying at home. There are lessons to learn and songs to go with them. The songs are catchy, and your children will be singing them right away. Think of the songs from "Mary Poppins" and "Winnie the Pooh"--the songs on "Learn Along With Me" were written by the same award winning Richard Sherman! The computer animation is state-of-the-art and children enjoy watching it over and over, and thrown into the mix are live-action videos of kids doing the activities in their classroom, so kids watching the video can really relate. There are no obnoxious Disney-like characters that teach your children to be obnoxious, just good, wholesome fun.
