I don't consider myself a dumb guy, I got bored in the cinema with blockbusters like Misson Impossible 2 or Blade 2, but there are some movies that are just to much for my intellect, and IHH was one of them. It's not a David Lynch, so I got more than 10% of it, but it's not an easy film. I don't regret watching it, and I will watch it again (some day) to see I've I can get the (whole) picture. Still (and I don't consider myself a brain-dead cine lover) I didn't find it an easy movie...

Go see it, but go with caution. PS: I sincerely believe I will review my vote upwards in a few months time.
