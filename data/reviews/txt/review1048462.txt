I had a chance to catch this film at Sundance and found it very moving. I have not always been a Bonnie Hunt fan but found her performance surprising and rich. All the performers were wonderful. It's a film about adoption and the grief that can come with missing someone you have never known. I had never thought about this topic before but found myself to be surprisingly touched. Also it's wonderful to see a film deal with complicated emotional issues with subtlety and grace. It looks beautiful, too: wonderful cinematography. I hope it comes to the theater because I've been telling my friends about it and want them all to see it!
