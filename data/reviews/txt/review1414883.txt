Just for the record, I'm not a huge fan of Julio Iglesias, but I saw the movie on one of the Spanish channels in Miami, and my Spanish isn't the greatest, so I only understood like every other word that was being said, but you kind of knew what the story was basically about and the emotions that Julio was going through from his accident which temporarily paralyzed him, through his recovery period, and him launching his musical career. There were a couple of poignant moments in the film, where he's fallen in love with the hotel switchboard operator, who refuses to feel sorry for him or even let him "be a victim" due to his temporarily incapacitation. So he slowly gets up and stumbles to his feet without the help of his walking canes. Then he would rather go visit a paralyzed child rather than talk to a record exec. The interaction between him and the boy is truly heartwarming. Then, of course he meets up with his ex-girlfriend, and his current girlfriend catches him in the former's arms. Well, its a somewhat mostly typical romantic story.
