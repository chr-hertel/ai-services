If you look in the scenes that take place in the bottom of the boat where all the animal cages are you can see one thats labeled Ratmonkey. This is from one of Jacksons B horrors called Dead Alive. I just thought it was awesome to see it there. Other wise pretty kick ass movie, lots of action although it was about 40 min too long. I don't know where he could have cut it but if it was just a little bit shorter it might have been easier to sit through. I don't have problems with three hour movies but i think some of the scenes between Ann and Kong were a little drawn out. If three hour films are making a comeback then maybe movie time intermissions should make a comeback too.
