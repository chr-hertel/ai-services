I gave 10 just to improve the rating, because this movie is freeway better than average level. May be the story is quite trivial, but the picture is brilliant! Almost every frame is like from paintings of great artists, the colours, gamma are like from masterpieces of Gustave Courbet or Eugenie Delacroix. You can fill the atmosphere of that time. After seeing the movie, I was quite curious and sniff the Web for extra information about Vidoque as a person. Reading some articles I found that Eugène François Vidocq was real man, who lived 1775  1857, he became from a criminal to one of the first private investigators. There are some unbelievable and magic stories about him. By the way, it was interesting to know that the story has routs. So that I think it's great movie. Alexei Karaghiaur, artist
