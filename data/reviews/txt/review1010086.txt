It was a great movie. To me the movie would be loved by thousands upon thousands of people. I lend it to my Tio, they watched it, and loved it. It was an amazing movie. It is one of my favorite movies. Johnny Depp was great in the film along with all the other characters. They performed really well. I don't remember it coming out because I was very young at the time. I feel that this is the type of the movie that you can watch overs and overs without getting bored of it in less than a week. Everyone who worked in this film probably gave all they had in putting this film together. You can tell by the first time you watch it, that everyone did a tremendous job. I recommend this movie for all ages and groups.
