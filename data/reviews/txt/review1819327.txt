"Adam" sounds like an episode of "Stargate SG-1" on paper with familiar faces under the influence of an alien being and acting out of character. However, it's a welcome direction for the series and it shows the cast's talent.

There are some particularly dramatic moments in this tale and the normally restrained Gareth David-Lloyd is splendid as a guilt wrapped, borderline-psychotic Ianto. It's taken me a while to warm to Ianto but there's more to him than meets the eye.

Unmissable British science fiction on a shoe-string. 9 out of 10. This series of "Torchwood" is proving to be a great improvement on the (still entertaining) original.
