We really loved this movie ... it was tons of fun and we found ourselves either smiling or laughing through much of the movie while it kept it's drama & romance edgy enough to keep it very interesting. Both my wife and I felt that this movie was very cleverly written, directed, and produced (I was very amused by the pop culture & modern music overlay to medieval dramatic situations, and it works very well). We've seen lots of movies but have never seen this type of thing done this cleverly before. The acting was excellent all around. Lastly, the romantic interests were done well enough that it was very cool for both men & women movie watchers. Looking for a movie that feels good while keeping your brain from turning to mush? This is an excellent choice, and you can feel good seeing it several times over.
