If you mix a little of Warcraft 3 with The Mummy 3 you get HellBoy 2. Does that make sense?

An evil elf of royal blood wants to break the ancient truce that held humans and the other creatures at peace. What other creatures, you ask? Why, the forest Gods, the creatures living under bridges and suspiciously similar to Star Wars aliens, trolls, elves, tooth fairies and goblins!

Now this is a true revelation for me, the perfect recipe for peace: leave everything to the enemy, while you hide in some magic sewer.

The story is ridiculous, the characters completely not sympathetic and the Peter Parker anguish just doesn't sit well with a red angry demon.

Bottom line: it's not even good for laughs. It's an average modern day no brain neo-fantasy film. Yuckie!
