I read lots of reviews about this movie, and lots in English, but much more in Chinese. Lust, Caution has overwhelmed the Chinese movies reviews, and most of the comments give very high credit to the director and the actors, a few complained about there has too less politics in the story. Ang Lee is a great director, and all of the crew did a great job for this movie. One thing reflected from this movie is that here has lots of Americans trusted Ang Lee, and gave decent credit to the movie, which is very impressive, because America people obviously are open minded, and would like to see different cultures, and also appreciate movies from different culture. as another reflect from China, all Chinese from different areas, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland china are very much touched or expected "Lust, Caution". by the way, Chinese are very disappointed that Academy rejected this movie represent Taiwan for the "foreign movie", which is definitely awful for every Chinese people, i believe.
