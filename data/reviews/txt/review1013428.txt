Director Ivan Lai, who has helmed his share of sleaze classics (DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS 1 + 2), tries real hard to exploit maximum capital from every gory, perverted, bullet-ridden moment of this highly recommended thriller.

It's a fetishist's wet dream. The gorgeous women of the cast all wear short skirts and we get plenty of opportunities to see up them. The rape scenes are as graphic as possible within the rating category. The opening sequence, in which a pretty young maiden is kidnapped, raped and dismembered, is a real keeper. Also worth noting is the music and sound design.

There is a gleeful amorality about Lai's films, a nod (intentionally or unintentionally?) to Japanese "violent pink" cinema of the 70's and 80's.

The modus operandi of rapist Roy Chen Chih-Lai does not really wash, but that is not the point of this film. The point is gleeful sensationalism of gutter-level subject matter.

There is a strong erotic undercurrent and leading lady Jade Leung is pretty damn cute and pretty damn feisty as a police detective on the rapist's blood-spattered trail. Miho Nomoto, a Japanese actress who plays Jade's sister, turns in a terrific masturbation scene that pushes the boundaries of the rating.

Although it doesn't maintain the style and pace its opening stanza establishes, it is still righteous, unapologetic sleaze.
