Was Amy Adams actually pregnant? If not, how was the scene done when she was on the floor, on her back,pushing her body up in practice for delivery.Her stomach and abdomen, free of clothing, looked like the real thing.If she was not pregnant, how was that appearance accomplished?It seems unlikely that a form of filling was placed on her body, then covered to make it appear as flesh, and in a logical shape. But if there is such a "make-up" or "visual effect" I would like to know. Of course, it could have been a type of trick photography, maybe. Whatever it was, someone please enlighten me on the true facts. Thanks. speedhumps
