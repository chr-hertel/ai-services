I first remembered seeing commercials for this TV show and saying to myself, "This sounds pretty interesting. I think it just might be good." Boy, was I totally wrong. The show has a great lead actress, Daisy Donovan, but the entire show idea relies completely on her comedic humor, and at some point her accent and constant speaking among other Americans gets very old, very quickly.

A show like this just goes to show you that there are some ideas for shows that sound good, but put into the wrong format can be devastatingly bad. Courtney Cox and David Arquette are doing the right thing by trying to come up with new ideas, but this one was totally bad. Hopefully we aren't exposed to this utter waste for much longer.

The only reason why it's not a complete failure is because it exposes us to Daisy Donovan, who has a quick wit and good humor. I look forward to seeing her in other TV shows or possibly movies, but you won't be seeing many people liking her through this role.
