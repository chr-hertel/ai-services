I went to see this film with a friend of mine who's a huge Sandra Bullock fan, just for the moral support. I didn't have any expectations for it, I actually thought it would suck, but, surprise, surprise, it didn't. It is far from being a great film, a lot of plot holes and a kind of a silly storyline with Keanu, well trying to act (he fails as usual). But it's cute and Sandra just gave a good performance, as usual. She is one of those actresses who never disappoint you, no matter how lame their film is (Jodie Foster is another). Her character is the only thing that you can relate to in the film. T 

So yeah, it is one of those lame but cute film which slides easily from your memory and in a week you wont even remember seeing it. I recommend it as a snuggle film, at least the couple behind us seemed to enjoy it ;)
