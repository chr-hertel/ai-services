"The Man Who Knew Too Much" does a good job with its drama, but somehow it lacked a draw in human warmth that it should have had, or at least interesting characters.

I did not sense a real attraction between James Stewart and Doris Day, and their son seemed more annoying than he ought to have been. While that can work, none of the main characters seemed all that intriguing on his own, and none of the supporting characters had much color either.

The early Morocco scenes conveyed a good air of creepiness right from the start -- that something was not quite right on the family vacation. But where the McKennas ought to have been laying the groundwork of their relationship, establishing sympathy to the viewer, I just found them stilted and uncomfortable without much charm at all.

The later scenes in London lost much of the lingering menace, until two climactic scenes in the last half hour. By this time, the family relationship of the McKennas was pivotal to evoke sympathy for their circumstances, and the lack of depth there took away much of the impact of the scenes.

The film also lacked the humor that is common in most Hitchcock films, with extremely few laugh lines or situations.

On the whole, it is a decently done suspense film, and it does entertain, but it is not one of Hitchcock's greats.
