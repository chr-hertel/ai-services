Loved It Once Again!!!! - I'm not someone who needs to view a movie multiple times, and had seen this movie in the theaters in 1993, remembered it was a very good movie but forgot the details and decided to view it again today on TV. I haven't changed my mind! Very well done! And Tom Cruise is a sentimental favorite as he is a great actor, his popularity has only increased since 1993, and we share the same birthday! It's a real thriller. So much is going on in this movie and it keeps you in suspense the entire time......One of the original John Grisham movies, now a classic, and a very well-written story.........

The actress who plays Tom Cruise's wife is just beautiful, but she seems to have dropped out of sight since that movie. And she ironically seems to resemble Katie Holmes...........
