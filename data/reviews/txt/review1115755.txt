As you can probably tell by my ID i have a passion for demonic/killer clowns and this is one of the best evil clown movies EVER! The story goes that a group of youngsters are terrorised by a persuasive and fiendish clown called Pennywise but the film doesn't just focus on them as children, instead years after they think they have killed Pennywise he returns to their adult lives to wreak more havoc.

Pennywise (played by Tim Curry) is the driving force behind this movie, his comedic taunts are hilarious and creepy at the same time which fits in perfectly with the theme and the scenes where Pennywise claims a child victim are pretty disturbing but because this is horror its great! The children i have to say are much better actors than the adults and personally i missed their presence during the second half of the movie. The ending is great with a surprise i and most people i know didn't see coming and all horror fans won't be disappointed. 

I strongly recommend that everyone see this masterpiece and witness one of cinemas creepiest villains ever in action. BEEP! BEEP!
