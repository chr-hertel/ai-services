Since the previous reviewer mentioned most of the story and gags, I'll just mention once again that the two mice in this short-as in many Harmon-Ising cartoons-bear a resemblance to a certain Famous Mouse from Disney except this time, besides the fact they are so small, they also wear no clothes! Most of the gags are indeed pretty unusual by today's standards though many of these types were common in many '30s cartoons particularly the musical ones. Watching this, I was reminded of Flowers and Trees, Disney's first three-strip Technicolor cartoon that won the Oscar two years later. Mainly because of the human-like trees and the way they made music. So, in summation, The Tree's Knees is highly recommended for anyone interested in early Warner Bros. animation before Tex Avery and many of the characters created in his wake gave the studio a new attitude...
