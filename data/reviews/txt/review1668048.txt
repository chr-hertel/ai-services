One wonders what horrible powers of the universe controlled the minds of movie makers 20 years ago. And - just as much - the minds of the audience that made this film a classic...

Found myself astonished, laughing, sighing and almost crying watching this movie. Not that it was inherently fun nor sad, but just... Pitiful! So much it's both sad and fun.

The surface not mentioned - then we're talking gender roles, realism, 100 most dramatic ways to show a thug getting killed, motorcycles, and much more that was really hot in the 80's...

So - extremely interesting from a historical perspective. Or for anyone who wants to take another step to understanding how fully and totally culture and your own mind is very very shaped by present trends. See it, laugh, cry and realize - you will react the same to Lord of the Rings in 15 years!
