I have just watched this again for the first time since it appeared on TV which has to be almost 40 years ago. Although a nostalgic trip back in time, this version will always stand the test of time. The black and white monochrome gives a timeless quality which sometimes colour cannot.

The day to day detail of Robinson Crusoe's mind-numbing existence and how he is able to overcome the many obstacles taken for granted is brilliantly worked. By inter-cutting flashbacks until the time when his life on the island begins to take shape, momentum is never lost.

The haunting musical score adds an integral dimension to the overall fascination of the series.

The French production team and main actor Robert Hoffman deserve much praise for the achievement created here. Not only a cult classic, this TV series, like the book, is now one all of its own.
