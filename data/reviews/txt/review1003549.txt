i had never seen or heard of this movie before,but being a big Sarah Jessica parker fan i purchased the DVD-yes it is available-at a music store in Sydney,Australia. it was at a bargain price of five dollars so i thought even if it was crap there would be no harm done. and what a surprise i received.the actual clarity of the film was not too great,but the movie itself was great. Sarah Jessica parker was so fun to watch at such a young age and she puts forward a great performance with an acting style that is so reminiscent of the top notch performances she gives to this day. a sweet,entertaining and funny at times little film that left me wondering why i hadn't heard of or seen before. definitely at the top of my collection.
