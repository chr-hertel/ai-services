not many people of my age unfortunately have seen this movie........

This movie teaches us to respect the older generation...the character around which the story revolves is anandi who is a widow and is abandoned by her family until the day when arun Gupta arrives(he is related to her through her husband's side) and takes her into the city(of course, from the village).

unfortunately for anandi her life turns upside down when she realizes that arun and his wife have brought her into the city life not out of respect or concern but because of their own cheap motives.....all they want anandi to do is to work as an ayah just because she is old and is indebted to them for keeping her. Then comes along the street rowdy class of young men who just make enemies among themselves and show their superiority over one another.

but anandi teaches them the virtues of humility and respect......... the movie also comes packed with a great song-koi jota jisko ......
