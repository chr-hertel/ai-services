Outstanding 1962 vehicle with Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick in the throws of alcohol addiction. This is a terrific film in the genre of "The Lost Weekend," as well as "Smash Up" and "I'll Cry Tomorrow."

The tragedy here is that Lemmon and Remick marry and have a son. In order to get her into his lifestyle, Lemmon introduces Remick to the bottle and before long she is on par with him when it comes to drinking.

Their degradation and ultimate ruin brought on by alcoholism is fully realized here. As Remick's father, Charles Bickford put in still another solid performance. Who can forget his outburst at Lemmon. "My daughter never drank until she met you." The ending of this film will forever tug at one's heart where Lemmon has tried to stop drinking but it's off to the bar for Remick.
