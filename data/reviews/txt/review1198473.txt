Writer/director Niki Caro adapted screenplay about the story of Pai, the heir to the head of the Maori Nation. A heartwarming story and an outstanding acting performance from newcomer, Keisha Castle-Hughes. She deserves an Oscar nomination as well, but alas there is an unusually busy slate of Academy Award type films in 2003, so Keisha might not make the cut. Surely if less of a performance from child actors Tatum O'Neil (Paper Moon'73) and Anna Paquin (The Piano'93) can receive an Oscar (Best Supporting Actress), then Keisha should be nominated (Best Actress or most likely as a child actor - Best Supporting Actress).

This is a significant, substantial film. It's not only a movie about female empowerment (aka, Bend It Like Beckham), it is about the human condition. Audiences certainly have embraced the movie for its emotion, its beauty, its well directed screenplay, and its magic. But, what hits men and women the most is the visceral feelings of remembrance of there own childhood (coping with loss, rejection, dealing the anger of adults, mind reading as a emotional defense, unconditional love, and appreciating life's joyous moments). We have empathy for Pai, because we have all been there - either within a family or as an adult (12 years old inside) trying to find our way in changing situations and changing world conditions. There are many hidden subtleties in Whale Rider that make seeing it more than once a worthwhile endeavor.
