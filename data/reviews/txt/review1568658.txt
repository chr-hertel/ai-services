Total Eclipse really is the best film I have ever seen. Leonardo DiCaprio is brilliant, 13 years have past since it's release and he still has to top his performance in this film. I was familiar with the Rimbaud-Veraline story before seeing the film and I personally fin Arthur Rimbaud one of the best poets ever. He is brilliant and this biopic is too. Great acting, a marvel of a film, great scenic locations and that soundtrack!!! I loved it, the music is wonderful, I thought it was a breathtaking film, I really did love it. The storyline, the characters, the subject matter, the actors, the music, the locations, the whole film! it truly is a masterpiece. I encourage anyone who likes dramas and biopics because this is one of the best biopics. Arthur Rimbaud himself would be proud with the efforts of the cast and crew because they bring his life story to life again, for our generation and to be honest, they do him proud.
