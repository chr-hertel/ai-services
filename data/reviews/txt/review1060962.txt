I took my whole family to watch this and whether they were 16 or 46 everyone enjoyed it. It was so good to be in a full movie theatre with happy people enjoying themselves. Covering the comedy horror genre isn't always the easiest task but in this film it is done exceptionally well. You really aren't sure what is going to happen next, it really holds your attention. I just want to tell all Bruce Campbell fans that I found his autobiography by chance on a bookshelf in Edinburgh and would like to recommend it. Sadly it was completed before this wonderful film was released but what a film, you have read it all so won't repeat but only concur with all good reports listed above.
