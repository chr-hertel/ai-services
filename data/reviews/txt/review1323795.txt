I really liked this movie.Antonio Banderas played Zorro better in this film than he did in the mask of Zorro. I really liked how we saw Catherine Zeta-Jones do more action and get into the movie better. Adrian Alonso played the son of Zorro with great Zorro like comedy and action.

This movie had great action and passion. The villain's idea to take over the world was great.The bar of soap was a genius plan but Zorro wouldn't let that happen.

I really thought that the would not get back together and it was a wonderful movie for the family.
