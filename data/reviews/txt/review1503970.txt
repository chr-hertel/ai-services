Reading most people's comments on here, I just don't get it. All these positive comments must come from the cast and crew and their family members. This move was god-awful and I would advise many not to spend their time watching it.

Having lived in Astoria for many years, I can say that this movie is completely bogus. They set up Astoria as some poor neighborhood, and all the characters wear the same ripped clothing in each scene. But the undisputed truth is that Astoria has been a middle-class (presently very expensive) neighborhood since the 70's at least. So the basis of the main characters being poor and unprivileged is completely incorrect.

The dialog is hard to sit through, and incredibly slow moving. the editing is erratic and dizzying. the wanna-be artsy camera techniques are nauseating. This is a horrible movie, point blank. I have NEVER walked out of a movie in my life .. and this was so close to becoming the first one.
