When I first saw the poster of this movie I knew that I had to see it as soon as possible, it was not a question. I love all kinds of costume movies especially the ones that play in the past and pictures promised a refined "Film Noir" atmosphere that I also love. Must admit though that it cannot be compared to Sin City which is a much greater movie, it still has some kind of a nice catch that made it worthy to see. 

I absolutely loved the scenes with Elizabeth Short in it. I never heard about Mia Kirschner before this movie, but liked her acting much more than that of Scarlett (hers I did not like at all but maybe it is the character) or even Hillary Swank who was considerably better than Johansson. 

But no matter how much I liked the mood of the movie I still cannot give it a higher rating than 6 because of the slow pace and the endlessly curving story - sometimes I though this one is never going to reach its conclusion while I watched it. 

Also I liked the side characters much more than the main ones. Scarlett played a dull character. Bucky was fine but far from touching. They could have put a bit more spice into them please. Now i don't want to insert more criticism, a lot of other people already did it before me. All in all, i think it was still worth to see.
