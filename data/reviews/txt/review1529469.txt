Only one word can sum up this movie and that word is AWESOME!!! I was lucky enougth to see a preview screening this morning and when it had finished I was just filled with joy and felt great, this film captures the nativity fantastically and extremely accurate too, it also depicts the emotion, the hope, the awesomeness of God and much more that you don't really think about when thinking about the Nativity. This is a powerful movie. I recommend this to anyone and everyone. Seriously I could only say one word when I came out of the screening and that as I said was the word Awesome, I was blown away. If you see one film this December, then this is the film to see! This is what Christmas is all about!
