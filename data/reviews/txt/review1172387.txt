The Emperor's New Groove has to be one of my favourite films. I am not a child, and I am not obsessed with Disney. Maybe The Groove isn't entirely conventional, but it's without the usual princess and the pauper theme of falling madly in love. It's not a credible film really, but it is funny, and the characters are comic genius! It is wacky, and is the type of film which you can really quote from. I love it, and I'm glad to see others do too. If you haven't seen it then rent it immediately! I love Kronk, the dim sidekick of Yzma, and I especially love his shoulder angel and shoulder devil. This film does have slapstick humour, but it pokes fun at everything and everyone, without going too far.
