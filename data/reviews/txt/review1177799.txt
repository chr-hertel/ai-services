An excellent, heart-warming comedy provided with an intelligent plot and great characters.

This short movie is sprinkled with a wonderful fingertip feeling for bizarre humor. Leif Andrée's superb performance as a slimy lawyer is simply hilarious. I haven't laughed so much seeing a Swedish movie since "Tillsammans". 

The fact that these guys manage to make a movie that is far superior to most of the works by the more established directors in Sweden in 2004 with practically no money says a lot about the climate in our provincial country. Let gifted young directors like these do a movie with the same budget as "Tre Solar" instead of throwing away money to has-beens, and bring some life to Swedish movie!
