I liked it.... bit of a rip off from lord of the rings... but still good. its funny how everybody finds something to complain about....if its not the plot, its the actors and their acting, if its not the directors its the effects and so forth. so if the lord of the rings series was a little over powering, try Eragon. it was pretty good. but in relation to others comments about the acting being absolute sh*t , i didn't find it sh*t at all! so whatever movie your going to see or want to watch don't listen to movie critics or people who can't find anything bad about the movie so make some stuff up, go see it! what ever floats your boat!!!

oh and i was just reading other peoples comments about how the book was so different, so much better than the movie......its exactly the same as the harry potter series .... your safe so long as you haven't read the book. but i do have to say they did cut out too much of the book and focused too much on the little things rather than the important parts!! it isn't such a let down unless you've read the book because you don't know what your missing out on. how ever i still enjoyed the movie but the books were better!
