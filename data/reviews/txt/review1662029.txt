It's evident that this film is a labor of love! I think any one from any culture can relate to it. We're all dealing with cultural fusion and as we encounter diverse cultures and fall in love, we all have to stretch ourselves and gain appreciation and understanding of each other.

I found it sweet, charming, funny, engaging, and it's beautifully filmed and performed by a dynamite cast.

Does Scott Bakula EVER age?! He looks great, as always. It's nice to have him and Robert Beltran in one movie--two of my favorites. What a treat! 

Other great movies in this vein: "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" and "Catfish in Black Bean Sauce".

The DVD commentary about the "making of" is also engaging. This film is a "Mom and Pop" venture, with the lead's real-life son as her movie son. That relationship adds a wonderful dimension to their scenes together.

The Latino community pulled together to get it made, so it's really from a grassroots effort straight from the heart of a community that needs it voice. Bravo!!!
