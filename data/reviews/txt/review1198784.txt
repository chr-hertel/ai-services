Based on Heaven is a film which was made for people who didn't know polygamy cults existed. And that would beÂ… who? OK, I'll be fair here. This expose of polygamy cults, down in Colorado City and (gee what a surprise) Utah, isn't REALLY all that surprising, though it inserts some amusing bits here and there. This film mainly focuses on the women that escaped, or kicked out of the polygamous communities, and they of course tell their stories. Of course, as you know, they were slaves, baby factories, etc etc. Again nothing really new. I only wished they spent more time on the boys and men who were kicked out of the communities (because of course, they provide more competition for the men who have plenty of wives already to acquire more), then to focus on the umpteenth shot of children born to polygamous parents running like hell from strangers because they're taught that those people are the spawn of Satan (which is true lol)
