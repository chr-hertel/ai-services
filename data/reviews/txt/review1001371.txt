I have seen the Village and wasn't impressed. The ponderous, truly plodding pace leaves the actors (and actresses) in this film working desperately to save it. The views from camera angles aspect were well shot, but the direction was sorely lacking. The young lady who played the lead female role was very emotional, and acted with conviction, but was VERY unconvincing concerning being blind. Nice plot, but so predictable. A big-name cast was not given the free rein to develop their respective characters, in my opinion. Siguerny Weaver was playing her role with all the force in her very talented ability, but had, quite simply, too little to work with. William Hurt was convincing, if so low-key that it left a flat response. Once again, direction/lack thereof? Just my view lanman1us
