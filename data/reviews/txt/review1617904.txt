I was so upset last niter after buying this movie that I wish I owned a shrink wrap machine. I own all the Bods and have since VHS. I grew up with them. Even the Non-Bond series Never Say Never was a Bond film. OK - Here is the requirement for a Bond film

Amazing action in the opening credits, followed by incredible titles and a killer new theme song to set the mood.

Tons of beautiful women and a stretch from the Flemming book but the idea that he may have written a few pages. 

Ian Flemming really wrote Casino Royale. They promised to be loyal to the book. I have waited to see a real Flemming book dramatized. No hope left. 

I like Daniel Craig, not here. No charm. He did run his ass off. No gadgets. If you want to say it is the first movie, then go back. Not forward. If he got there from here, go back. 

The story was written in ten minutes at lunch. No thought. 2006 items in a post WII plot, don't make it better, made it unwatchable.

I hate to write bad reviews unless they are merited. I bought this movie based on the 10 out of ten star reviews. Somehow the 1 and 2 stars were buried.

It's time to say Never Again.
