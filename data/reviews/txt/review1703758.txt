Absolutely shocking how powerful this movie is. It's one of the films that will be loved by people who can relate to it, and I'm one of them. Dan Millman is Rocky for new generation. And who would've thought Victor Salva, who made Jeepers Creepers 1 and 2, was behind this. I've wanted to see Peaceful Warrior since the first time I saw the trailer, I've read all the raving reviews about how amazing and life-changing the book is and I was absolutely hyped for this. I wasn't disappointed, not even once. I think this film's message is so powerful, and so profound that it puzzles me why this was so under the radar during it's release in the cinemas. I'm a 'sucker' for inspirational films - I think they're the one way to get people to learn something from them and take action in their own lives.

Peaceful Warrior has now become one of my top favorite inspirational films, up there with Dead Poet's Society, and Rocky
