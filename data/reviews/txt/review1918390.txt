What a movie!! simply a feast to the eyes.THis is one superhero movie which can be watched a million times!.If u haven't seen it please go for the joker! Heath ledger was simply spectacular, one of the best villain roles ever played by a comic villain.This movie is very different from the other batman movies because it has a better storyline and heart-pounding action.Credit also must be given to Christian bale for his amazing performance.. but frankly speaking the joker steals the thunder..There is a whimsical turn in the ending which makes the movie one of the best of all times.. its almost perfect! RIP Heath ledger,you were BRILLIANT!
