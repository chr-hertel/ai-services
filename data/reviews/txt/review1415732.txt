My favorite Nancy Drew Game. Beautiful scenery and setting, wonderful music and atmosphere. Definitely worth the money. I loved playing it.. especially on a snowy winter day! Lots of mind-boggling puzzles. Amazinggg! Nancy goes to Wisconsin for a ski vacation, but there's a blizzard, so she can't. But she has to solve a mystery while she's there. There's a royal treasure that Nancy must find (hidden by Marie Attoinette centuries ago). But someone else is desperate to find it. Nancy must sneak into several rooms, and she discovers that Wickford Castle's history is much more interesting than people think it is. The characters all have their own personalities, and I didn't expect the culprit to be who it was. Great game, worth the money.
