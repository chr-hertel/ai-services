Wretched, Unfunny, Unentertaining, Self indulgent wandering crap. Chapelle must feel guilty about his mainly white audience because he worked hard on making this presentation relatively inaccessible to them. THere is a lot of wandering dull dialog about nothing with various non-interesting rap people. A joke might happen once every 20 min and I don't think there's a single entire song on the whole damn thing. This is unfocused and self indulgent and not even the slightest bit interesting, funny or entertaining or watchable. BTW- I LOVE CHAPELLE SHOW- BUT THIS IS TOTAL JUNK.

IF this video made Dave quit after he watched it- THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE. He has now joined OJ Simpson scouring the golf courses of America to search for the real killer.
