Other than Bruce Campbell and some decent aliens, this movie has little going for it. The plot is simplistic, the dialog stilted, the editing and pacing are painful to watch, the acting is horrible and those wigs and beards -- ugh! I kept wondering how the aliens ever took control in the first place, back when humans still had backbones. They didn't seem to know how to fight! They basically just stood there while the humans killed them, very rarely using their weapons. Even Ren√©e O'Connor was pretty much wasted here. Her part could have been filled by anyone. If Bruce Campbell hadn't been in this movie, I'd be giving it a 2/10 rating. Boat payment, Mr. Campbell?
