That's the only explanation I can give for this episode. Pods must have been placed in the bedroom of the writer, and when he awakened like "new," he wrote The Wiving.

It's not so much that it's awful--fans of the show appreciate the excellence of so many other episodes. But can you imagine someone being told to watch Gunsmoke (It's a classic Western!) and then stumbling across this travesty? And it's not funny. If it were the least bit amusing, it could stand on its characterization of three goofball sons and their insipid fiancees. There's almost always some humor in Gunsmoke: Festus is entertaining, and Doc is clever. Hey, I like a good laugh as much as the next guy. Maybe more than the next guy, if that next guy wrote this episode. Did I mention it wasn't funny?

Be warned. I could say be forewarned, but what other kind is there?
