I gave this short film a 10 for a very specific reason: This film became a springboard for both the Writer/Director and the Lead Actor. The fact that this film cost 2 days and $500 makes it quite fantastic that the careers of at least two young men have been assured.

As many already know, this is the short which Jered Hess and Jon Heder made in Preston, Idaho...detailing what amounts to a day-in-the-life of a smalltown nerd. Heder's character development of what would become Napoleon Dynamite (Seth, in this film) is obviously undercooked, but the ingredients are all there, and it tastes just as sweet. Think "Cookie Dough".

In the Director's Commentary, Hess admits to messing up the exposure which shows itself in most of the outdoor shots, and while it's a little distracting, overall it almost lends a kind of "low-rent" charm which you quickly get used to.

9 minutes of quirky angst, and you can't help but grin throughout. Film "quality" issues aside, and keeping in mind this is basically a "student film" in regards to writing and character dev, and it's really just very cool that the small amount of effort which was undertaken could blossom into a Feature Film deal and an underground hit.

Word-up to all aspiring actors and directors: All you need is 2 days, $500 bux, a quirky idea, some basic film skills, some ninja skills, an interesting character, and a belief in yourself and you too can give up your day job and move to Los Angeles for an exciting career in the Movies!

...which beats a decroded piece of crap anyday!
