When Sam reads about a haunted house in Richardson, Texas, in a website, he convinces the reluctant Dean to drive to the place. They investigate the controversial witnesses of the spirit of Mordechai Murdoch, a man who hanged his six daughters and himself in the cellar of his farm in the Great Depression, but they do not find any evidence of truth in the story. Later, they disclose that it was a prank of two teenagers, but the legend of the fiend became real due to the belief of the readers of the site.

"Hell House" is probably the silliest episode of "Supernatural" so far. The story is a joke with the weird friends of Mulder in "X-Files" and is practically a comedy, totally different from the last episodes. My vote is six.

Title (Brazil): "Casa do Inferno" ("Hell House")
