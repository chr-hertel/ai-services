This is the best movie I've ever seen. It has everything; a good director, a thrilling history that you want to involve in yourself, good directed action scenes, romantic histories that has it's turning points in the main story, a good cast and good assistants.

And(!) it's a great video version based on a great book. (and that aren't always so easy to manage, especially not when the book it's based on is so full of action, and details, so thumbs up for Peter Jackson and his crew =))

The actors are a chapter for itself, who keeps the story so living, thrilling and amazing the whole movie. They does an amazing job, and I thinks nobody can deny that.

The people that got the job for the costumes also did an incredible job dressing the actors so they looked like elves, men, dwarfs, Orcs, Moria goblins, hobbits and other fantasy creatures + those who computer animated all of the trolls, Ents, servants of the dark master, the dark master himself, the flame Deamon from the old ages and all of that stuff.

I'm feeling that Iv'e said my opinion about this subject, (if eleven Oscars has not)
