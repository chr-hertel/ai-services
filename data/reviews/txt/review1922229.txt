'The Savages' moved me more..this one is about a rather wishy washy son playing against a rather exquisite Dad but he wants to stay in self pity mode not appreciating his Dad who gets more attention than he does...he spends most of the film resenting his spunky father with little insight as to his father's caring for him while faulting and whinning about his father's escapades and envying his Dad when he could be minding his own business...the film is slow and didn't move me much..to each their own, eh...disappointing...the camera work is enjoyable with lots of breath taking English country side..the Father is a pleasure to watch as he dances brilliantly through the film making it bearable to sit through.
