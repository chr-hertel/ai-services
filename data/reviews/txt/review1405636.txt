I enjoy the show a lot. The main character is kind of a jerk to patients in general with good reason: They lie to doctors all the time. He plays it well overall as well as his supporting cast. I'm a huge fan of Omar Epps who also appears in this show. He has been in other really good movies and always does a nice job. House is a show about hospital's, administration of hospitals, addiction to pain medication, infectious disease cures, the lies patients tell to their doctors, and the innate ability of this doctor to see through them and cure people. Because he is such an ass to people it causes really neat conflict in the show which is fun to watch develop.
