This show is very entertaining, it is well casted. The story is great, who doesn't love watching high school football, it adds story to where the movie left off, with different characters. It was the one show this past year my roommates and I always watched. This deserves multiple seasons, and has produced good numbers for NBC, and also was nominated for an Emmy. This show has even gotten time on ESPN. 

Kyle Chandler does an excellent job as Coach Taylor, he is a very lovable character. As for the women on this show, wow, gorgeous.

Their choice of camera style, I personally like a lot, it makes me feel like I am more amerced into the show.
