This was one of the first Zombie films I saw and since then I must have watched it dozens of times. I now own it on DVD and though I admit it's not the deepest film ever I still find it one of the most enjoyable. I think what I really love about it is the pace, yes it's the standard slasher plot, more or less, but it speeds along and is chockablock with top moments. Gore,female nudity and a great cast many of which sport the popular 80's all denim look. Yes, it may not be one for the critics but I would certainly recommend this to anyone who loves all action horror. The fact the it was made on a tiny budget with an unknown cast makes it all the more amazing. Warning though, I really recommend that if you do get the DVD with a making of extras feature, don't watch it! I know this sounds like strange advice but the director/main zombie comes across as quite arrogant and bitter and quite spoils further watching of this otherwise top movie.
