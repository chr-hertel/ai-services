Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed watching this movie 2 times in the cinema now. 1st time I-max in Amsterdam 2nd in the local little theater. My girlfriend is a big fan of this movie (yeah women definitely enjoy watching this movie also) But, this movie went #1 within a week on IMDb. That means it surpassed all the movies registered on world's largest Internet Movie Database. I'm sorry but am I the only one who thinks that the movie owes this success to Heath Ledger's death? Not that he didn't act marvelous in this movie, he did. But I could name lots of movies which are better, or more entertaining, or more complex. I didn't even had to hold my breath in this movie.

Normally I'd give this movie 10 stars but since everybody blindly does that I must give it 1 star.
