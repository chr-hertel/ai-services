It's one of the best films,i've ever seen. I can say that it's not for everyone,because film is a little idiotic but that's the reason why I like it,why it's so funny and cool. I think acting is close to perfect,especially Jay and Bob and "Jay's Rap" in the beginning is very cool and funny.Maybe it's the only reason why I gave this film a try.

And one more thing that amazes me is the presence of some actors that,in my opinion,are too "serious" for such a movie. For example Ben Affleck,Matt Damon,Jason Lee,Eliza Dushku,Seann William Scottand some others.

In the end I can say that this movie is "must see" for everyone who has good sense of humour and who wants to find the way to spend one hour and a half in gaiety and merriment
