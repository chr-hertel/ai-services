What the deuce? A movie starring Jackie Chan and Jet Li should not rise to high expectations, however earlier movies casting them have been in range medium to good. The forbidden kingdom is just crap.

The root to all bad karma in this movie, is the amount of clichés, and a retarded American melvin, who is the supposed main character of the movie. The start features him as the new kid in the block, having to stand up against the local bullies, after bragging about his marshal arts skills. Come on, what kind of plot is this! Furthermore the American dink spoils countless scenes, through what i thought was more of an eastern movie. It makes your brain hurt,when he repeatedly whines about how much he's not suppose to be here and he wants to go home. Clichés, in terms of exadurated scenes about friendship and love, a fair amount of medium and bad acting, somewhat lame plot in total, in addition to mr melvin pulls this film down to the ground. I feel obligated to rate this movie lower, due to its current total of 7.2 If you still want to watch the forbidden kingdom, keep close to the audio-mute-button, so you can tune out of the most embarrassing parts!
