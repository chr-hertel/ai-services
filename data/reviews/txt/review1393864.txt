Chuck Norris returns again as Col.James Braddock in a sequel which basically contradicted the one before it, in this one he finds out his wife and child are alive and so he goes to Vietnam and rescues a bunch of Vietnam/American orphans in this tiresome sequel. MIA III was the only one that didn't make money and the only reason it was made was due to the fact that the other two made money and Cannon was on hard times. (How do you explain this, American Ninja III and so on...) In this particularly cheap production Norris basically doesn't do much and he seems utterly lost when asked to emote. Sadly this entry lacks the energy of it's predecessors and there is a twist of sentiment which basically make this one hard to swallow. Also worst of all the action sequences are shoddily staged and this easily emerges as the worst of the series.
