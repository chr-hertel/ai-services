"The Sky is falling! The sky is falling!" Those are the first lines that were said in Chicken Little, the story of a little chicken who embarrassed himself by believing the sky is falling. Of course no one believes him, but what he thought was true.

The story concept of Chicken Little is well thought of and continues where a classic tale ends. It is truly unique from the other Disney films because it starts with a little chicken ringing his school bell, wailing that the sky was falling. The beginning has a lot of action, but then quickly falls apart. Chicken Little starts from embarrassment to baseball hero to a "savior". The ending was surprising, I had to admit, but there was one lousy fact that the animals just broke out into song whenever the movie writers couldn't cook up anything.

In my opinion, Chicken Little is a great movie for kids, but adults might sleep through it. It starts up with full of hype, but then quickly goes downhill. I personally had a lot of laughs, but I also felt restless at the same time.

Bottom Line: Don't wait for the DVD. Watch the movie, or just don't even watch it.
