A good little chick flick. What makes this work is Ashton and Brittany's on screen chemistry which really helps with the laughs.

Unfortunately about 98% of the funny scenes was seen on the trailer. Do yourself a favor. If you haven't seen the trailer don't see it now.

This is funny but thats it. There nothing else its just plain funny. What makes it worse is its very predictable ending.

The acting is exactly what i expected. Ashton and Brittany were good. The acting was like just do your lines and go home kind of thing.

I do recommend it if you like chick flicks.
