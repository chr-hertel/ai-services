This is a wonderful, sweet, and (to me)spiritual movie about people needing each other, and coming together to help each other heal. If you're looking for car chases or moronic dialogue, this isn't the movie for you. Daltry Calhoun is in some ways reminiscent of "To Kill A Mockingbird", (a book the character June happens to be reading in one scene). Lots of subtle playbacks and references,(Johnny Cash, Charlotte's Web) and it's funny too. I have a great deal of respect for Johnny Knoxville, who, as a father himself, chose a vehicle that his own daughter will be proud to watch. He had great credibility as a father. Juliette Lewis was likable and believable as a woman falling in love after the loss of her husband.I liked the fact this movie didn't have gratuitous sex and showed people developing relationships, all in a humble, non-preachy way. The plot unfolded slowly and with subtleness. It made you work, and made you think more deeply, which to me, is what an indy film should do. I liked the subtle, yet impactful emphasis on values and spirituality. The main characters in this film, including Knoxville's and Lewis' characters were just plain, decent people. This might be the kiss of death in reviewing it, but you could show this film to a church group, and have plenty to discuss. Plus, it is funny, and has a kick-ass soundtrack. And, while this isn't a selling point for everyone, I find Johnny Knoxville someone who, despite all the fun (and rapier wit)of Jackass and Wildboyz, appears to be a deep thinker, with intelligence, and, dare I say, the desire to make a nice family film with a moral message. I loved it!
