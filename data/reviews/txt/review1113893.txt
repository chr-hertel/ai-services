This is a class A lycan vs vampire film. It has good special effects and a good story line and characters you love and hate.

The main characters are Selene (Vampire Death Dealer ) and Micheal ( Half breed between the 2 species.

Selene is like a daughter to the main Vampire leader VIKTOR. He's full of attitude and all others respect him. I was disappointed when they killed him off after his fight with Micheal and Selene.

The storyline was okay in places but they should'nt of killed all the council members, so they could arrive at the mansion and judge Selene for awaking viktor and seeing Kraven judged for his alliance with Lucian ( Head of the Lycan Clan).

I'm looking forward to the 2nd movie in the series, i've read thats its going to be a prequel, so Viktor will be in it, but really in my opinion they should have let him live.

Great music and costumes and fight scenes.
