What makes this episode so special is that it's 100% pure parody without a hint of getting serious with current themes or teaching a lesson like in so many other episodes. "24 Minutes" is not only an excellent parody of the TV-series 24 but also includes some clever jokes about the Simpsons universe which make any viewer appreciate this episode as a traditional Simpsons episode, too.

The Simpsons has kept on going for almost 20 years and even the most loyal fans can probably agree there were times that the quality of episodes was going downhill. While it's unlikely they'll make more episodes as daringly different as this one, what "24 Minutes" proves is that the writers still can come up with fresh ideas and jokes and even have the courage to break loose from the format that has kept the show on the air all these years.
