This is the worst movie i've seen in a long time. It's a lame story without suspense. It is not frightening at all and there is no real plot, at least, not a good one anyway. You can really see it's a low budget movie (for example: when they arrive at the train station in Bratislava, the camera moves, like it was filmed by some amateur). I'm from Belgium and we speak also dutch, but what the actors were talking in Amsterdam in the movie, was German, certainly not dutch. They make it seem like Europe is some kind of poor continent. When i saw that Quentin Tarantino had something to do with this movie, i thought it was gonna be great, but it turned out to be a big disappointment! Short: 3 guys wanna get laid in Europe and they get killed 1 at a time in Bratislava, without any real reason. Go see it and see for yourself, it's LAME!!!
