Okay, the summary is meant to be sarcastic. Without laughs, a comedy certainly can't be worth while and that is certainly true of this listless little dreg.

Eddie Boland plays lead in this dull film about women mechanics (which, I think was THE joke of the film--how sad). During the first portion of the film, he's supported by Sunshine Sammy Morrison--a cute child actor who went on to the the first Black member of the Our Gang comedies (and later, in the Dead End Kids/Bowery Boys films). While the kid could certainly act and it was nice that his Blackness was not an issue (i.e., no racist jokes--he was treated just like any other kid--something very enlightened for 1922), it just wasn't all that funny. Then, when Eddie walked into a car repair shop "manned" by female workers, this also was pathetically uninteresting and I can't see how anyone could see this as particularly funny or inspired.

Overall, a terribly dull and unfunny film--and this is from a guy who LOVES silent comedies.
