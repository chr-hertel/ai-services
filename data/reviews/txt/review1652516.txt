This movie is not half as bad as the comments make it out to be. It is good, could have been better, but good none-the-less. I rarely see a movie that could have been better if they did this or did that and didn't do this, etc.... It really could have had less disco, and that fact really shows how out of touch with the real world these people in the movies can be. As far as the giant US Flag, perfect! After all this is in NY City and they are everywhere! How perfect was it in the first one on the flagpole?? Venom sure could have been in there longer and less of the Sandman. They really tried to put too many "the moral of the story is" messages in there, forgiveness, everyone has a choice, one man can make a difference, accidents do happen and some criminals do things for what seems to be decent reasons. God, there are a lot of them. Anyhow it is a good movie and you might not be as disappointed as all these other comments might lead you to believe.
