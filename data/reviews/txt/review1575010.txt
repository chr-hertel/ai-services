I'll admit this movie wasn't Shakespeare but at least it was fun to watch.If you like movies with lots of shooting and non-stop explosions,then this movie is for you.If you hate movies with a lame plot cardboard characters, then by all means avoid this one.And if your a fan of John Cena you'll like this movie no matter how much it sucks.Because let me tell you this movie is pretty mediocer, but its never boring. The Marine isn't really worth buying, but it is renting and watching it at least once.

My final thought is simple:The marine is stupid,cheesy no brainer entertainment. It does what its supposed to do,give you something to do when your bored.
