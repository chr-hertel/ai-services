Arguably the best vampire movie yet, and I've seen all of them. The cinematography, script, plot, and characterizations are all done beautifully. This is not your half-comedic run-of-the-mill John Carpenter vampire flick. It's quite intense at times and not a movie you'd want to watch alone on a dark night. The vampire portrayals are quite gruesome -- especially the leader (Marlowe?) and his girlfriend (Iris?). (She's the stunning vamp chick with the long nose.) Whoever did the make-up work for this movie deserved an award because it was absolutely brilliant. I highly recommend this movie if you like "realistic" no-nonsense vampire movies.
