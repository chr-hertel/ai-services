A very, very good movie. A bit heavy on the Jurassic Park replay (could have cut 20 minutes out of the film and made it a more comfortable sitting) and overuse of the incredulous comic book heroics that are, by now, becoming a bit stale for movie-goers, however this film has some very noteworthy high-points. First of all, Naomi Watts is superb, as she always is. A very worthy and convincing beauty to the classic and timeless beast. However, she was upstaged by the performance of Kong. So realistic and potent in terms of pathos were the combined efforts of Kong's portrayer (Andy Serkis), his director (Peter Jackson) and the involved team of techno-wizards that I would expect the academy will have to consider whether or not an animated character can be or should be nominated for Best Actor. Very powerful offering by all involved to bring Kong not only to life, but into the heart. As I left the theatre, trying to maintain composure after being very moved by the final scene of the film, I overheard a big, burly biker-type fellow saying, "I had to look away from the screen. I was starting to get tears in my eyes."
