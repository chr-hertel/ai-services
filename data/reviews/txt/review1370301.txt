I was actually looking forward to seeing the jumble that is called Chicken Little. The plot is horrible, the voice performances are horrible, the direction is horrible, the animation is not up to scratch, and it is worst of all not funny at all. I had expected it to be all of these things at once. Zach Braff is a very talented guy, he has one of the best current TV shows in Scrubs, and he has one of the best movies in the past several years in Garden State. Why he chose to do Chicken Little is way beyond me, you would think he'd be a little brighter then that. The rest of the cast includes the likes of Joan Cusack and others who should also know not be have anything to do with this mess. One horrible film.
