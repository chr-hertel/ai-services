First off, I wasn't planning to see this film but one of my friends dragged me along, considering that we had nothing else to do on a Saturday night. The opening scene where Mr. and Mrs. Smith is in therapy was a a good set-up to what I believed to be an excellent mix, of action/adventure, romance, and a bit of comedy. As the movie progressed, I became more and more involved in the storyline. Excellent performances by Pitt and Jolie, and I was amazed at the on-screen chemistry they shared. I could definitely see why the tabloids are so involved in their "relationship". Perfect roles for both of them, especially Angelina because she just has the right on-screen charisma. I also felt that there was excellent comic timing between some of the scenes, especially the whole "hidden identity" concept and how the neighbors are unaware of what's going on.

In Conclusion: I won't tell you any more except: prepare to be impressed with great action scenes, top-notch performances, and highly original storyline.
