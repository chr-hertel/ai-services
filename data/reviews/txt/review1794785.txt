I was excited to see this show for 3 reasons: 1, I am a huge fan of Matthew Perry and couldn't wait to see him return to TV again in a major role.

2, I quite like The West Wing so thought it would be good to watch

3, The ads run on E4 and More 4 (UK TV channels) made me WANT to watch it!

I have loved every minute of the show. I thought the first episode was alright, but it just got better and better. Sure there are a couple of social comments, but I think they are sensible ones. Its a shame its been cancelled... I wonder if its because of all the religion, war, politics and behind the scenes of TV? I thought it was an interesting concept, maybe one that some of the US weren't ready for?

Studio 60 is witty and smart. It is a funny, yet also serious. The actors were great and I was looking forward to watching the next episode week after week.

I really hope it comes back, because let's face it- we need this kind of show on our TVs! Reality TV is annoying, we need shows that make us think!
