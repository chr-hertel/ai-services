is so that this movie, this celluloid gift to humanity, could come into existence! Occasionally, on very rare occasions such a movie is released that is so perfect and magnificent in every single way that it changes the world and the people in it, and life morphoses to accommodate the glorious creation. This is the movie that humanity has been waiting for. Pure Cinematic perfection. I am so devastated that the highest score I could give the film is 10 out of 10, because it should in fact rate off the Richter scale. 

In addition to being the most powerful and thought provoking movie in the history of cinema, it has also inspired me to become a better, more caring and generous person.

The planet Earth owes you much, "Leprechaun" - I feel so sorry for the star Warwick Davis - everything in his career to come after this will naturally be a let down, because it is absolutely impossible to top this film. How disappointed he must be that "Lord Of the rings" could not compare to this. I, for one, would like to thank the creators for giving birth to such a masterpiece, that as I soak in every ounce of this movie I lose my breath and shed my tears. The term 'best movie of all time' is thrown around a lot, but as of 2005 I think we have an answer to this much debated topic. So if you haven't seen this movie, go out and do yourself a service, and rent this masterstroke of film-making.
