Who wrote the words and the music for HELLZAPOPPIN? Certainly it has enough "songs" to be considered a musical. It is listed here as a comedy which it is, but it is as much a musical. Whoever records these facts for the site should be more careful when categorizing a film. Also, what is its cumulative box office? Was it a number one box office film when it was released? A film has sociological significance for its period and that is covered as "burlesque humor", but it also has commercial significance. I don't need ten lines to ask these question, but the site insists I write them; so I am ad libbing here in an attempt to fulfill this requirement.
