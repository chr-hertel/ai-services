This was a terrible shamefully bad movie.

Sooo BADDDDD was the acting you just had to think all the actors (all of them) were just praying that this would go straight to video to be quietly forgotten. Well, we have not forgotten and we will not let this bad choice fade quietly into the night - hear us - this movie sucked. And we will remind you of it every time you make some stupid comment on how great an actor you are.

Don't even get me started on the video editing. Do not let children play with video editors - weird cuts and edits do not make you cool. Go back to your AV broom closet and stay there. 

Direction - If only I had the directions to the directors home I would post it here so that we could all take up pitchforks and torches and pay him a visit.
