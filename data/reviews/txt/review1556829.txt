I am in agreement that this is one of the best shows to come along in a good long while! Casting Anthony Michael Hall after his long hiatus from the TV limelight was a stroke of pure genius. I recently had the surprising pleasure of seeing him in Sixteen Candles (Molly Ringwald) as a young teen and could only chuckle at myself for not recognizing the sheer talent he brought to that movie at a young age. Hindsight being what it is, it is no surprise at all that Mr. Hall is getting the play he deserves.

What IS WITH the USA network - all of them, for that fact - with constantly rearranging the time slots and program days. Is Tiger Woods in the room? Did I accidentally stumble on to a golf course where the rules require that you play the ball wherever it lands ... and where it lands is anyone's guess?? I've lost more good, QUALITY, shows with trying to keep up with where they land, and, yes, Monk is definitely one of the better ones.

Wish there was a way to revolt against said network(s) to let them know they are getting in the way of their own success!
