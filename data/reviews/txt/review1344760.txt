It's hard being in love with someone who's not in love with you back. But it's even harder when you're a teenage boy in love with your best friendÂ…who is also teenage boy. Tobi is the captain of the rowing team, and the summer of the German national rowing championship is also the summer that Tobi realizes that he is gay and that his best friend Achim is not. "Summer Storm" brilliantly captures the pain and awkwardness of unrequited young love. Gay or straight, it sucks to be completely obsessed with someone that you're so close to but can never be with. Tobi wants Achim, but he doesn't want anyone to know that he's gay, so Tobi pretends to be in love with the beautiful Anke. Meanwhile, Anke is falling in love with Tobi, but he treats her like crap because he secretly wants to be with Achim, even though Achim has a girlfriend and is obviously not gay! It's heartbreaking, but what about the teenage years isn't?
