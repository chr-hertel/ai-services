Frank Powell (as George Peabody) and Mary Pickford (as Ruth King) are a-courting. When Mr. Powell decides to venture out west, to make his fortune, Ms. Pickford is devastated. She promises to wait for his successful return, and gives him half of a locket; and, they pledge their eternal love. While Pickford pines away, Powell gets way-out-west drunk, and takes up with Mexican woman Marion Leonard.

Powell's descent is a little difficult to comprehend; perhaps it is the power of drink. He seemed to have very little use for "The Broken Locket" while in Ms. Leonard's company. Leonard writes one powerful letter, by the way; the mere reading of one may cause blindness!
