Imagine my horror at the thought of 2 hours worth of Adam Sandler in some sort of sentimental comedy-drama. However, this apprehension soon turned into gentle amusement as the film got under way. Sandler is actually watchable in this flick; for the first time ever, I didn't want to jump out of my seat and punch him until he stopped. His performance was convincing and genuinely surprising. The film itself suffers from Leoni's voice, which reminded too much of metal being scratched. It is also too lingering on the sentimentality and could've done with being a few minutes shorter. It's too lightweight to really get to grips with the issues of race and class that it raises, but then it is more about relationships. Other than this, it was quite funny in places; with Leachman's 'old woman' performance being a highlight. Paz Vega looks great and carries off her 'Florrrr' with aplomb... I suspect it'll get about 7/10 on the IMDb, but it's a 6/10 for me.
