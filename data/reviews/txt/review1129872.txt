Well, although it is a high grade for a not-very-known-movie; this is a great performance by the Cirque Du Soleil (The biggest and greatest cirque now existing) by mixing "Romeo and Juliette" and the currently-touring-show "Alegria". This is one of the 2 movies that the Cirque has made, and even though it doe not has a lot of budget they make a enjoyable movie. There's a great performance by Julie Cox, who before this was a little unknown, and she might not have a lot of fame but after this it gave her a good point in her "Resume√©". And this other unknown-movie actor Rene Bazinet, who had formerly played in another Cirque show, "Saltimbanco", who gives a funny and charming performance. It isn't a Must-see movie but a pleasant-to-see.
