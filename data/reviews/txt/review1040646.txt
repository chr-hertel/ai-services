The young ones clearly was one of the greatest comedies ever written for the British BBC TV.Although I was not born until early 1988 which was a good lot of years after the show had ended I very soon picked up on all the shows jokes and quotes.I saw my first ever episode of The young ones about 8 years ago and just could not stop laughing.The show was set in Thatchers Britain back in 1982 in the middle of the city of London and was about the lives and times of four rather looney university students who pretty much just sat around in their dump of a flat all day and never really actually bothered to go into college.The main characters were Rik the peoples poet who was always showing off about how great he claimed he was, Vyvyan the hard man who loved to smash things up(very often their TV set if he did not like what was on the channels) Mike the cool person who was the leader of their group and Neil the always bored Hippie who was always giving off about having to be the one to make the meals.There was also the actor Alexei Sayle who played many different and hilarious roles in all the episodes.

My favourite episode of The young ones is called "Bomb" in this episode an atomic bomb lands into the students flat next to their fridge so the gang must figure out what is the best possible solution to this problem before world war three breaks out or something however something far more worse happens,the TV man calls at their door and they have just found out that Mike has not bothered to pay the Television licence.This episode almost had me in tears with laughter.Other favourite episodes of mine are called "Sick" and "Summer Holiday" which are again hilarious.

Overall the best things about this show were the humorous characters and actors,the great quotes and story lines not to mention the way they always had a famous music band on playing a cool song from the time half way into each episode.These bands included the singers Madness and Motorhead plus many more good artists.My favourite characters were vyvyan and Rik who were played by Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson whose good comedy script writing talents went on to make "Bottom" another really good show in later years.This was a classic British show and I wish it had made more than just 12 episodes as do a lot of other fans I think and I would suggest to all fans of good British comedy to watch this show.So overall The Young Ones deserves 10/10 stars.
