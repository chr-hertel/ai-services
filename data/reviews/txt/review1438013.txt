this movie is one of the best animated drama movie i have ever seen. it's really heartbroken . you feel like it takes many hours to watch this movie but the fact is it only takes one hour of your daily life to watch it and that's because it's full of events. a really must see. i really loved the character of seita. that's because he was really kind and responsible about his sister as he was also smart. while the little girl was really amazing. she made the audience cries i think. but i really hated their aunt for so many reasons. this movie is really good to watch it not only once but even million times and it's will never stop making you cry. i watched it when i was only 10 years old and it really broke my heart.
