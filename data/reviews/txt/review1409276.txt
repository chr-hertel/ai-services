As I grew with the late Christopher Reeve's interpretation, I would sincerely say that I had the chance to say Brandon Routh can fill his shoes. He did it on a good way, sure wish for the next installments that he will still do the same job...

For the rest of the movie, I noticed a lot of cross-over references upon the first two movies. It was refreshing that we forgot the following adventures of III and IV... (and even some footage of the late Marlon Brando...)

However, I didn't get used to Kate Bosworth's interpretation of Lois Lane. She was not very much on scale, however, since she might be back, hopefully we can model the character to be more on the adventurous side...

But, put Kevin Spacey anytime on the villain side and you got a great result. His portrayal of Lex Luthor made me forget Gene Hackman's first interpretation and of course, Luthor didn't have hair at this time ! Only other thing: film is a bit too long and should have been at a respectable limit of two hours. There were too much sequences that should have been taken off...

But, hey, the movie's good anyway. Should restore the faith to the Man of Steel's fans who have still bitter memories of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace...
