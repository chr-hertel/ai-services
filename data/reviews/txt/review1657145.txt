Sam The Sheep Dog and Ralph Wolf are probably two Looney Tunes characters who are unfamiliar to a lot of viewers.....me included. As fellow reviewer here, Robert Reynolds, points out: the prints in this series featuring those two don't seem to be available, although I have seen these two characters in another cartoon somewhere. Perhaps they weren't available when he wrote that in 2002.

Ralph, by the way, is an earlier edition of "Wile E. Coyote" of "Road Runner" fame. Here, we get to see him a little different and get to hear him talk (although not much). These guys pretend to be buddies but once the day starts and they go their separate ways - it ain't so: Sam is guarding the sheep and Ralph is after them! At the end of the day, they are buddies again and goodnight to each other as if nothing happened!

The stories are all the same, whether it is Ralph and Sam or Wile and the Road Runner. One is after something and just never gets it. In the process, he (Ralph, in this case) gets brutalized every time. The inventive methods the wolf uses are almost always funny. In fact, I think these Ralph-Sam 'toons are just as good if not better than the Road Runner efforts. For example, the bridge made out of firecrackers was outstanding!
