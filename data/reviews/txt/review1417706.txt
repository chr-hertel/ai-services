They filmed part of it behind the crappy apartment i lived in at the time on Duke University Road. Morgan Freeman walked right by me. There were no tourists really because it was such a bad area of Durham (oh joy). They pulled their movie trailers out at the end of filming that part that evening... too much reality. The movie itself was sort of suspenseful. I also know one of the extras that was in it, a Durham cop but met him years after movie was out. It was exciting in a depressing kind of way. The house that they filmed in was just an old run down house beside an apartment building on a side street of D.U. road (also known as Chapel Hill Road). I guess the movie was based on a true story?
