I'm not great at writing reviews, so I'll just keep it short. This movie was great. Very engaging. Very well acted. 

I moved to the Bay area 3 years ago and never really heard about Harvey Milk until recently. The whole story, including Dan White's "Twinkie Defense" is jaw dropping. If you aren't a right wing bigot, you should thoroughly enjoy this movie. Sean Penn is a class A actor through and through.

PS: If you don't know much about the subject, go to the movie first, then do some Wikipedia research on Dan White, Harvey Milk, and Anita Bryant.
