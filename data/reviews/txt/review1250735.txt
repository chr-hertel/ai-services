This is another copy of "I know what you did last summer" or "Scream".

Actually I think I saw a similar movie, only better, a few months ago. The plot is some kind silly, involving some high-school students with nothing better to do than just inventing some serial killer story and freak out other people around the campus and outside of it. The acting is good, but the lines are sometimes silly, really hard to understand, leaving a lot of questions, which is good sometimes, but not in this case because they don't make a lot of sense. Ridiculous portions, where they play a silly game, show up and mess up the story a little bit.

My advice is if you haven't seen it, don't buy it... If you can, just get it from a friend who already did this mistake...
