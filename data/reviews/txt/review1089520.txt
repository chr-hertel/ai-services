Taking into account when this film was made, and what Fritz Lang had to work with, this film has to be easily be considered one of the best silent films ever made and certainly one of the best sci-fi films ever. The set designs and absolutely amazing, so good that many sci-fi films can't compare to them 80 years later. The story is also very good for a silent film, building up enough suspense and drama to easily keep my attention for the entire two hours, something which much shorter silent films have not been able to do for me.

Fritz Lang was so far ahead of his time with this film, it just had me totally amazed. I found it quite ironic that this film, made 80 years ago, paints a good picture of the path our world may be taking. Maybe its just the pessimistic side of me, but we continue to become more and more dependent on technology yet we are depleting more and more of out energy sources. There also appears to be a larger gap forming between classes and the power the upper class is able to enforce. Could this lead to a future quite similar to the one Fritz Lang pictured? Maybe, maybe not, but thats the beauty of this film, it can get you thinking about larger issues such as that, unlike many silent films where the world is portrayed as all hunky dory, and everything ends happily.
