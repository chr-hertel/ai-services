though not, i fear, as an actress. nice photography, a plausible script and some believable, if stereotypical, characterisation.it's not a ground breaker and it's clearly not big budget, but those who call it "the worst ever" should get out more. they haven't seen enough movies. It's subtly sinister without resorting to the overused shock tactics and crudely managed special effects so often used to shore up truly poor examples of the genre. i'm not sure if it's intentional, but i found my sympathies going towards the so-called villains, which is some achievement. they have a warped morality and a sense of suffering. unlike the obnoxious elizabeth who may or may not get what she deserves.
