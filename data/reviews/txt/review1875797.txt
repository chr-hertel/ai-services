In my opinion, this first part of Blackadder is pretty much neck and neck with the second series. Yes, Blackadder may be more Mr. Bean-like, there are rather muxed-ip plots and surprisingly dark humour, but I still like this series. Probably the best thing about this first part of Blackadder is the into and the credits, which are surprisingly fun - the credits have an entertaining song in it (and a different song and credit roll in the last episode) and both have Blackadder boldly riding a black horse. Funnily enough you never see this black horse again in the other series and I think he is one of the best parts.

This series is a comedy running for 6 episodes. The star is Edmund Blackadder, played by Rowan Atkinson. His companions are Baldrick, played by Tony Robinson and Percy, played by Tim McInnerny.

I recommend this first part to anyone who likes Mr. Bean in some way or another, who likes comedy historical series (just after Richard III) and for people who want a good introduction to Blackadder. Enjoy! :-)
