As a member of the community and a participant in Jackson Horn, I just wanted to say how proud I am. I am totally blown away by the support the City has given and the time/effort that the people involved have chosen to give. It is really neat to see a project of this level here in Yakima. There is not much here in the industry and when a show like this comes in, bringing in tourism and money to help the local economy, well that's just huge. Business after business lined up to help this production and to the producers credit, they found a way to get everyone really involved. This show truly feels like a community show and it's something that we are all very proud of. I hope to see more Jackson next year, and kudos to the producers Josh Hodgins and Aaron Boltz. You guys seem to really care. I have never had the pleasure of working with Josh directly, but I have worked with Aaron and he is so amazing. Keep up the good work Jh Productions!
