This film has the look, story, script, and acting of a bad student project.

There is nothing of interest here. In fact personally I would be embarrassed to have my name attached to this film. 

I won't go into detail because there is entirely no point.It's not even bad enough or tongue and cheek enough to be good.

I'm all for independent films and there are often some real gems, many of which are amongst my all time favourites which and easily outclass big budget movies. I'm thinking of classics such as Pi, Primer, Man Bites Dog, Das Experiment, and The Magician, to name but a few. But sadly it is not the case here. This director is going to have to seriously up his game if he wants a career.

Complete cringe-worthy clich√©d pooh from beginning to end.

Don't waste your time.
