That peculiar feeling stayed with me after watching this movie - I was sure of it - I was in love!! 

I was in love with Claudia Cardinale "the whore with a heart of gold".

The movie itself is excellent, but what gives just that little more, is, in my humble opinion, Claudia Cardinale's corrupt uncorruptable character. She is the quintessential westernwoman; the woman every man who would ever intentionally watch a western, didn't know it was possible to dream of. 

Sometimes I may forget her for a day or two, but I have a picture of her on my refrigerator and she's been with me for 3-4 years now. 

And such is the entire movie; as Nietzsche ended western metaphysics, Sergio Leone effectively ended the western genre. 

9/10 for the movie - plus that 1 extra just for Claudia = 10/10
