I think that the episode of Pasolini is wonderful (the last Totò's role!!!). So only for this reason, the film deserves 10! Also Steno's is good. The last (with Walter Chiari) is not excellent. Maybe there isn't a common plot between the episodes but also the movie title suggests the reason. "Capriccio all'italiana" means "Caprice Italian style". So this is the reason...

In the restored version for DVD, we can see this film in its beauty..........................................
