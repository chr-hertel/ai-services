The realism, not too mention the phenomenal acting of Morgan Freeman, Denzel, and the rest (though Broderick was straining that "Southawn" accent at times) made this movie one of my all-time favorites. I watch it any time I've been to see a stinker in the theatre, and it makes EVERYthing all better!!!

If you are a civil war movie buff, a war movie lover, a history lover or just a lover of art, then Glory is not a movie anyone should miss. If you are fortunate enough to find this movie for sale somewhere, I would not hesitate to pick it up because it is worth owning (and I don't own many movies), but if you can only find it to rent, then go and get it... NOW!
