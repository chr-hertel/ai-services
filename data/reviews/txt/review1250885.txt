The continuity was getting pretty messy by this time, so we just had to pretend some sequels never existed. Yeah, why the hell not? This one follows in the footsteps of "Scream" and is just pretty much the same movie, only not as good and with a former horror icon in it. Kevin Williamson even has some kind of co-assistant-producer credit. I don't really think the script is that good, so beats me why Jamie Lee Curtis was keen on returning, but she's there, good. One thing I don't get though, if we're supposed to assume that part 4 never happened, shouldn't we get another explanation to why Michael is still alive after being blown up? We actually saw his corpse burning through the credits of that second one. I did really like how his without a doubt massive burn wounds had completely disappeared when he revealed himself in part 5, but we're drifting off. This sequel really isn't bad, the action is decent, but it's pretty toothless and has a very low body count. That's not the most important thing in every horror movie, but it is when it has little else going for it. They did wrap it up in a cool way, but yet another sequel ruined that. Small bonus because a guy gets a skate through the face, which is just cool.
