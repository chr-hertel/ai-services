I mean, what is more important in a movie comedy-intended than to laugh..so i laughed . I think the movie did it's purpose..entertaining,it's just bad that some of the actors didn't want to get past they unknown status and so just Griffin was acting in his grip-laugh character like way.I gave this movie a better mark than it deserved simply because this is not by far a 1 movie,you should check out "lake placid 2" for that ! I was pleased to see so many nice cars in one place and a nice soundtrack ! No other racing ,cars-like movie got too much better so i think it's just a genre that doesn't excel on acting but gives good (nice) FX and a bit of good looking girls and cars of USA .

Rent or buy the DVD !
