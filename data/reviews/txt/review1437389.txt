Guest starring Phyllis Diller and Lawerence Tierney.

It seems as though they were going for a comedy version of the Excorcist. A demon is possessing a girl's body and a couple of famous exorcists are doing the s√©ance, and it goes from there. Not much plot, but it's a somehow fresh episode, brought down by not knowing quite what it is. It goes for horror, but the whole thing is too comedic and silly for it to be scary. The ending is ridiculous, but somehow it fits quite well. This episode can be found on Tales from the Darkside volume 4.

My rating: Good episode. 21 mins. TV PG V
