Three brothers run an adult magazine. The eldest is showing signs of mental strain. He walks around Central Park smoking cigarettes. The middle brother is married to a free-spirit European nymph who flirts with both the oldest and youngest brothers (the youngest is a horny photographer). The oldest brother develops an abnormal attachment to the girl, and that's when the breakdown begins.

Even as mid-sixties adult films go, "Sin Magazine" offers little nudity (most of it photographs of photographs). The acting is adequate, but who cares? There's an eight-minute Point-of-view shot where the middle brother seduces a female magazine distributor who works out of a closet. Only for Al Mitchel aficionados.
