to cut the story short,..you have to love the duet, Harrison Ford was amazing and Steven Spielberg,...well, He is Steven Spielberg, the same brilliant director, the acting the music, the sound, it is not the best of the 4 movies, but it is on the same level, you have to bow in front of Ford's performance. the only thing I didn't like about that movie is Shia la Pouf, the kid is OK but I hate to imagine that he will be the next Indiana Jones, as I heard that Lucas wants to do so, ...PLEASE DON'T, we still love Harrison Ford in that role, please, please, keep Harrison Ford as is, you don't know how much this character is attached to Harrison Ford in our minds, and we love him, we really do.
