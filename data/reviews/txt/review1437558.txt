I took my grandkids to see this movie at a $1 a person theater. I really didn't expect much, after taking them to see Madagascar(boring!). But I must say that I love this movie. I'm going to take my other grandkids to see it tomorrow. Somehow I missed who the voice of Hammy was, so I came home and looked it up. Steve Carell was SO good as this hyper squirrel! I also absolutely loved the possum dad, William Shatner, he was so great making fun of himself. I'm getting this on DVD also! 

I just don't like any animated movies anymore, besides Shrek, but I LOVED this one. I've told everyone about it.
