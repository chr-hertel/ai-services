This film is a re-make of the Argentinian crime thriller "Nine Queens". I haven't seen "Nine Queens" so I can't say how faithful or not this film is to the original.

The story, set in Los Angeles, concerns con-man Richard Gaddis (John C Reilly) who spends the day teaching his young protégé Rodrigo (Diego Luna) the rules of his trade, until they both get caught up in a forgery scam.

"Criminal" adds nothing new to the usual formula of con-artist thrillers and does rely a little too heavily on coincidence in the plot. However it is also very entertaining, very fast and very well-played by a great cast. It is a great fun film.
