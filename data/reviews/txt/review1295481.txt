That is the year this Swedish movie is about. The summer is very hot and an immigrant is waiting for his wife to arrive. While waiting he meets a Finnish girl and some drama occurs.

The director makes his debut here and he has much to learn and mostly about telling a story. You've seen everything many times before and so has he. Too many times. But the good thing here are the actors and especially the photo. The camera sometimes "freeze" a moment and puts more poetry in it, than it has through the narration.

This is a first try, not without talent. But the filmmakers should maybe not go to the pictures that often.
