Interesting choice of cast.

chilling scenes.

Bloody violence.

Excellent soundtrack.

OK storyline.

Best game-based movie I have seen yet! I went to the cinema a few hours ago now I am writing this to tell everyone that no one should listen to the critics! They don't understand the game so they do not understand the movie. I have played the first doom games and Doom 3, I will say that this must have been a very difficult movie to make. keeping fans happy while making the movie approachable for new fans.

It will not reach BlockBuster, but its a nice little piece of horror and action to remember. I bet everyone, in the movie, tried their best to bring the game to life, bringing fresh, new action and if some people out there don't like it and claim to be fans of the game... THEN WHY Don't THEY TRY MAKING THIS MOVIE... Then we can laugh at them.
