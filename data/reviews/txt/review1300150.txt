If you look upon all Woody Allen's movies, I still think that Annie Hall is one of the best. Every time I have seen it, it has opened for a new way to understand it. And simultaneously it is like a person you've known as a good friend, whom you like to see again and again. And it is in no ways made as a masterpiece. It is maybe good as a clich√© of all what Woody Allen has made, and I think he has later repeated himself in later movies which are not so well known as this. The psychological syndrome named after Mr. Allen owes probably to this movie. What makes this movie to what it is, is really it's simplicity in the middle of all the many words which characterize the Allen movie and it's syndrome. Compared with "When Harry met Sally" it has something that makes it much more serious and less mainstream. This movie takes place in what is in a different world than where I live in. It is close to "Take the money and run" or better, "Play it again Sam", but a milestone better than that. "Manhattan" is a good drink but much more ambitious and artistic and therefore not as natural or down to earth as this: "You are New York"!
