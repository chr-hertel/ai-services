The old line of Clint Eastwood's third Dirty Harry series "Sudden Impact" really packs a punch. A cop gets coffee every morning before patrolling the streets, but making claims that the coffee is psychic, that means that danger is in the brewing. I mean literally. The would-be robbers didn't stand a chance against the maverick "Dirty" Harry Callahan. NO ONE MESSES WITH CALLAHAN! NO ONE!! Who could forget Albert Popwell. He was a punk in the first one, a murderous pimp in "Magnum Force" and a extremist in "The Enforcer". Now he's a friend in "Sudden Impact" playing Horace King. He shoots one of Callahan's targets with his shotgun. And don't forget that bulldog, Meathead, he should know how to handle insults by "reeking" in the winds. HAHAHA! This movie is a big one in the Dirty Harry collection series, and it is one of my favorites in that selection. Just make sure you don't end up like one the punks who cross this cop! Rating 3 out of 5 stars!
