i fail to see what was so wrong about this movie.the low rating(3.3/10 on this site)doesn't do it justice.i know the studio did little or no advance viewings or promotion.i'm guessing people jumped on the bandwagon,making sure they slammed it in earshot of every one they knew,before even seeing.trust me,there's a lot worse movies out there than this,many of which should never have been made,let alone released.this movie had action,some romance,some humour and excitement yes this is not Sean Connery's finest hour as he is way over the top.and yes,there are a couple of pretty absurd scenes.but honestly,it's not that bad a movie.i was very entertained.Uma Thurman was in it,for crying out loud.and in a skintight black leather outfit.what more do you need?OK,that last part would appeal mostly to guys,but still.i am definitely bucking a trend here and giving "The Avengers" an 8/10
