This is a film that was shown in England long before it appeared on American screens. It was a well directed film by Michael Powell and the music was composed by Ralph Vaughan Williams a very famous English composer and admired through out the world. In this film, Leslie Howard, Laurence Oliver and Raymond Massey, took a cut in salary for the War Effort at the time and were proud to be a part of this great film which clearly showed how very sick the Nazi's were and the so called leader of the master race, Adolph Hitler. It is very sad to think that a monster like Hitler caused so much human suffering and in this picture, Leslie Howard, (Philip Armstrong Scott),"The Petrified Forest",'36, was able to show how the Nazi's in the picture acted like little boys, burning books, and destroying famous art works. Laurence Oliver,(Johnnie, the Trapper),"The Marathon Man",'76 a French man who was a trapper and enjoyed being a Catholic, was violated for his belief in GOD. Raymond Massey,(Andy Brock),"The Dark Old House",'32 was an Army soldier who stood up and faced his enemy in the eyes and told him what he thought of him in more ways than one. This is truly a great Classic, and if you want some history, before America was brought into World War II you will enjoy this one. This picture was nominated for an Academy Award under a different name, called the "INVADERS."
