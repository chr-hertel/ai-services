Hoping to see The elegant Claire Danes nude was the only reason to stay more than ten minutes for this (Canadian) Thanksgiving turkey. There was no attempt to make the characters interesting, or to make the audience care what happened. Steve Martin's character had zero empathy, and no back story to explain why.The scene with Jason and Merideth came out of nowhere, and went the same place. Without a confrontation between the women it made no sense. Some movies will have a scene including a little gratuitous nudity, but even here this movie came up short.

better to go shopping and meet a real Shop Girl
