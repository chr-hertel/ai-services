A pretty decent remake of what I consider a classic horror flick. It stays pretty true to the original but it has some surprises thrown in that will still spook the seasoned viewer. The cast does a good job but the main thrills come from the cinematography and especially the music. The cast does a good job and casting Schrieber for Thorne makes it a little more believable that he could father the child; Gregory Peck did an excellent job, to be sure, but he always struck me as too old to be a first time father in the original film. That said, I will still recommend the original before this one, but if you're in the mood for a good horror flick in the theatres, this is your best bet.
