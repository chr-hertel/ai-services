I saw this movie yesterday evening where it had its premiere as part of the Sydney Film Festival. It was with much anticipation and a great deal of interest that I went to see this film, as there have been few Australian films centered around Rugby League (as opposed to AFL or Australian Rules Football - The Club, Australian Rules, The Great McCarthy etc). I was not disappointed. 'The Final Winter' is set in the early 1980's and follows the story of Grub, a working class married father of two who has been a loyal player for the Newtown Jets for many years. Grub finds himself at a crossroad in his life when the the teams administration decides that they do not need him and are moving towards a corporate style of management particularly in regard to their players. The film follows his journey, with the help of family and friends, as he reassesses his priorities and how he has defined himself. While the film is essentially a drama there are plenty of comic moments with cameos by some well known Rugby greats. And while the performances are excellent all round particular mention must go to Matt Nable's moving performance as Grub; and Raelee Hill as his wife Emma, her performance is astonishing in a film predominated by men. However it must be said that all the female characters in the film are strongly drawn or written, which is refreshing and gives the film a complexity and depth that other films, that center around all male sport teams, have lacked. There is a great soundtrack of early 80's Aussie songs to help recreate the era and set the mood. In particular 'Short Note' by Matt Finnish. At the end of the screening the audience was informed in a Q & A that the film has been picked up by Paramount. I am not surprised. This is a film which should get a wide release and deserves success. Recommended.
