what can I say, this movie rules it brings out a humanity and makes you care about these people I'd recommend this to everyone! this makes godfather look like a stain. I think it says a lot about the film industry it says you don't need anything to make a movie put in some actors a vague idea of a script and you have art, it's abstract film! if you don't believe me see it yourself because in this world, this is a masterpiece of 07 cinema a triumph of style! this may very well be the best film ever. name one problem with this film i'll argue well. so in general if you don't watch this movie you'll miss out on a lot. it's like taking gold and making it more shiny, it's utter perfection.

just joking, avoid this piece of crap at all costs! now here is why: bad plot, bad acting bad, everything else so, in general this IS the worst of the worst
