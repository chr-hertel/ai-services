Mad Max is a boring and repetitive movie. Most of the movie consists of a bunch of guys shooting each other through car windows while driving on an open field. No real plot to this movie, and even the action is pretty dull. I wouldn't suggest this to anyone.

The dialogue is witless and predictable. There is almost no character development whatsoever-- all we learn about Max is that he's married and that he's a cop.

This movie doesn't fail because of Gibson's acting, which is generally up to par. Rather, the lines and overall story he's provided with are what make this movie awful.
