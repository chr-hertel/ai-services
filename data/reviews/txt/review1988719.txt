I actually thought it was a good movie.If you haven't seen the movie its good go rent it, but don't read the rest it might spoil the ending. There was maybe one curse word in the whole movie. I love that with a two year running around we can watch movie's that are a little more decent than others. We have a DVD Player that cuts out any cursing so it bleeped out only once. I love Tim Allen, he's so funny to me anyway, I'm not hard to please. I thought that Luther was being a little selfish at the end. I don't think going on a cruise instead of participating in Christmas traditions was wrong, hey they could have save money. (but who wouldn't want to be with family & friends during the Holidays) I thought his neighbors should have respected that, but at the end when his daughter surprises the parents, he should have been a little more excited about his daughter being home for the Holidays. I'm not hard to please when it comes to movies. I can tell the viewer that didn't like it must have been a man, only men down chick flicks:) I think thats what made it funny, that you don't see nosy neighbors that care so much to do the extreme things that they did. I hope this post helps someone out. God Bless!!
