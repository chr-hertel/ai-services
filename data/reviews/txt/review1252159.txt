Not 100% sure if I enjoyed Team America: World Police as much as I'd like, but oh well. I am sure a lot of people didn't know what to make of this movie from the makers of South Park. An action movie featuring marionettes is something like a live action version of Thunderbirds.. Something I wouldn't really see. But, curiosity got the best of me.. This movie basically details a team's efforts to thwart the leader of North Korea to detonate a weapon of mass destruction (with the help of.. uh.. Alec Baldwin). The group recruit a Broadway actor (hilariously taken from his show called 'Lease' (a send up of 'Rent') and singing what could be the funniest song ever, "We all have AIDS". Soon they're off to Paris and Egypt (much to it's expense) and much battling ensues, both between good and evil, and as well, with the team as well. Much has been said about the sex scenes in the film. I can see what was cut, and to the ratings board I say, "good call!". Parker and Stone may lead the edge into cutting edge comedy, but they HAVE to draw the line somewhere. As for the rest of the movie, I liked it to a degree, I got the joke about it being way gung ho American, but it soon got tiring after awhile though. This, like South Park, would be better suited as half hour chunks on cable (though I did love South Park: Longer and Uncut). One final note. I feel Parker and Stone NEED to write a Broadway musical and turn it upside down.
