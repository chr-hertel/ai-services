It was my least favorite of his movies, but I did not hate it. I think the message was a really good one, assuming you understood it. 

He has had a hard road ahead of him since The Sixth Sense. It was the perfect movie. I kind of expected him to be like one of those authors that write the perfect first novel, and then disappear.

One thing NOBODY has mentioned. There were two scenes where the mike boom was lowered in to view. What the heck was that? Hello, editing? He is an experienced film maker, what happened? I thought maybe there was some point to it that would be revealed, but no...

I looked in the goofs section, but they were not listed.

Did anybody else see that?
