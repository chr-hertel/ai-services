Oooh this movie failed big time. It wasn't a complete failure, but based on the hype and attention it received I expected a lot more. My biggest gripe with the movie is how it was dragged along. Just about everything before finally seeing King Kong was largely unnecessary. Once the crew reached Skull Island where King Kong was located, things began to get better and more exciting and they stayed that way for the most part. The CGI was excellent. Unlike the older King Kong movies, this King Kong looked more like a silver back gorilla. I guess I was a bit thrown by the love story aspect of the movie. I wasn't looking for pure action, but the love triangle with King Kong, Ann Darrow, and Jack Driscoll was too much to stomach.
