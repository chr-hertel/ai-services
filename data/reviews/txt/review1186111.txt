A shocking film only for those not living in Lazarescu's country.If you are a potential "Lazarescu" , you react to the movie as to a...reality show.

Truthfullness of basic,minor,daily based dialogs between people(Lazarescu's neighbors ,doctors..)is one of the movie's best ingredients.The ways in which Lazarescu is left behind other stories/problems is so cruel...but so human too.We as individuals are ego-centrics and selfish by nature.

Black-comedy for some,unbearable drama for others(some left the cinema)-it is a great movie.

I am just wondering-the success of the Romanian film directors is depending on presenting shocking movies based on post-Communist realities?Will the occident accept other themes with no eastern flavour,made by eastern film-directors?Probably if director is Cristi Puiu-yes
