Here we have Greta Garbo as the most famous female spy in history,and she's given the most silly love story.Nothing in this movie rings true with the exception of Lewis Stone.He's quite good as the head of the German spy ring.Paramount did a similar spy story which is just as silly with Marlene Dietrich called Dishonored.At least that one was campy fun.Here we have a bland Ramon Novarro whose accent makes him not a very likely Russian.Lionel Barrymore seems to chew the scenery with the ripest sort of overacting.Garbo would perhaps fit the role later when her acting was more restraint,but here she is hilarious.And an exotic dancer is not what she is.The costumes are nice though.
