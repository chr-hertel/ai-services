Making a sequel or prequel is very difficult. Arguably, harder than making the original. Silence of the Lambs had a unique atmosphere of fragility and sexual inequality. You COULD just copy that, but it would just be a re-hash of the same old thing. Unfortunately, in Silence of the Lambs, all the attention was on Agent Stirling, and the audience barely got to know the killer - they were just added to the stereotypical group of serial killer... Red Dragon changes that. Not only do we learn more about Lecter's mutual relationship with Dr. Chilton and Barney (caretaker), but Red Dragon's antagonist, the "Toothfairy", also shows a rare glimpse into how delicate the balance is between sanity and psychopathy. He wasn't born a dysfunctional anti-social predator - he was made one through years of abuse. Yet in the movie is constantly at odds with himself, watching normal families, trying to lead a normal relationship, going to great lengths to find a balance between Agent Graham's repulsion of his artistic talent, and Lecter's complete embrace with his darker animal side.

This is definitely one of those movies that just keeps on giving, and you discover more each time you watch it. As Lecter puts it, "rest assured, this one will give you plenty of exercise".
