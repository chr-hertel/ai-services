I JUST finished watching it...

I'll say like some others have said; "it was what it was"... Not an epic, more of a short story... not unlike an actual nightmare...

The acting was very natural, and low key, certainly not "bad"... Very Good actually, in its simplicity... I thought the dialog as well was believable and unusually natural...

The videography/cinematography whatever, was creative, not irritatingly amateurish as some here have accused...

It was if they simply had a professional videographer documenting their circumstance...

Their ordeal being one of my fears, I was pretty stressed...

7 out of 10...
