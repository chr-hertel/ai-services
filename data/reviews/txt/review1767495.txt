I'm sure most people won't find my comment to be of much value, but to those of you with any tendency toward motion sickness, please read on...

I cannot comment on the bulk of the content of this film, as I only saw a very few minutes of it. I'm afraid the shaking camera was almost enough to induce seizures, and was simply more than I was willing to bear. (Does anyone still think this type of camera-work adds to the cinematic value of a film?) I suppose some people still consider a shaking camera to be artistic in some way, but as for me, this poor camera work constantly reminds of two things:

1) that I'm watching a poorly filmed movie, with no chance of really getting into the story, and...

2) that I need to add Dramamine to my shopping list

Luckily, I borrowed this movie from the library, so I'm only out my gas money. Oddly, I still feel somewhat ripped off. (Must be those high gas prices...)
