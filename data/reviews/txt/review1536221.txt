Oh, my God! This is definitely the scariest movie of the year. It is extremely horrifying and violent. Definitely not suitable for ages 17 and under...and I'm only 12. I still can't get over how extremely graphic and grisly the violence and torture was. And the plot line was very disturbing. I've been having nightmares ever since. This is definitely NOT suitable for children like myself. Your kids will never get over how horribly and terrifyingly frightening Turistas is. If you let your child see this movie, you will regret it.

But on the bright side this movie is very intense and graphic...and I'm a big fan of graphic gore and intensity...and disturbing images. The theme I couldn't handle though...too disturbing. See Turistas. If you're over 17, you will not be disappointed.
