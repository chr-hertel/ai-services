The majority of reviews on this movie must have been posted by the writer, director, and cast of the movie. This movie is by far the worst movie I have ever had the displeasure of watching. I knew nothing about the movie before renting it. My friends and I just like watching zombie movies some of which are very low budget and we take that into consideration but this was just plain horrible. The mirrored effects sucked to high heaven and they reused them repeatedly. The acting was embarrassing and the plot was not great either. Sheesh this movie set the standard in crappy horror movies. SET THE STANDARD!!! The chunky white trash junkie lead singer in the uber-wannabe band that scored the sad attempt at an action scene at the end was yep you guessed it corny and horrible. My friends and I watch crappy horror movies and laugh but this one was so damn bad we didn't even laugh because its not funny, its sad. I feel so sorry for the director and any other idiot that got dupped into spending money on this pile of rancid waste..

Mark my words people this movie wasn't even a good attempt to make a low budget movie. RENT SOMETHING ELSE!!!!!!!!!
