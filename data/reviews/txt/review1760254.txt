This cartoon features a lot of the cornball stuff Warner Brothers and others liked to use in the 1930s and the first year or two of the '40s: poking a little fun at famous fairy tales and imitating actress Katharine Hepburn with her affected "Bryn Mawr accent" to play a role or two.

Humpty Dumpty, Jack and Jill, Little Miss Muffet, The Three Little Pigs, the Little Old Lady Who Lived In A Show, and more are all depicted with one-joke scenes. Unfortunately, the jokes all fell flat with either the joke coming from dialog or a sight gag.

I wonder if audiences actually laughed at the theater in 1940 over this stuff. I doubt they would today; it's just a little too dated, humor-wise, to be rated more than a "4," and that's being generous. It's just not funny and certainly not the Tex Avery stuff we animated fans came to love later in the decade.
