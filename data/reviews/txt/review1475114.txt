A very creative spin on H.P. Lovecraft. The combination of horror plus comedy is something that I enjoyed very much! The DVD extras were very cool to view. The Easter Egg and Music Videos were exceptional! Keep 'em coming Elias and T.O.T.S., you guys together exude explosive vibes! I am looking forward to seeing whatever future projects that springs forth from such talented individuals.

Kudos also to each and every film-maker presented in LovecraCked the movie. It was nice to see the many different styles that everyone presented. It is definitely an honor for me to have this particular DVD, as a part of my growing DVD collection.
