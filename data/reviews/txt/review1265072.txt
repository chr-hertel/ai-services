One does not watch an Olsen and Johnson film for the plot, one watches their films for the sheer insanity of the goings on. The jokes are full of puns, both visual and verbal, and very witty interplay that often comes so fast that you have to pause a moment to truly comprehend what you've just seen and heard.(At the top of their form there were/are few comedians who can top their word play) Here Olsen and Johnson are up to their usual tricks with the plot having the pair fleeing from the law in a big city when their stock fraud is discovered. Despite professing the desire to go straight they are soon up to their old tricks in a small country town.

While not as fast faced and rapid fire like some of their other films this movie is still quite enjoyable thanks to really clever writing. The jokes keep you amused even when the plot seems to take a well worn course. Actually other Olsen and Johnson films suffer from weak plot, but they have better pacing. In their better films like Hellzapoppin, there seems to have a joke every couple of seconds and you don't mind the slow pace or weak plot because you're simply laughing too hard. This isn't to say that the film is bad, its not, not even by Olsen and Johnson standards, it just not the best work they've done.

Definitely worth seeing, especially if you've never seen an Olsen and Johnson film before. These are two of the best screen comedians that have ever danced across the silver screen and any opportunity to see them work their magic is always welcome.
