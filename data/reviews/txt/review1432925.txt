I was a huge fan of the original series yet I read a lot about the new movie prior to seeing it so that I would know what to expect this time around. As I now live in Miami and the local media are giving this movie huge exposure, it has been more high profile here that in, say, New York or Los Angeles.

I think Michael Mann generally is a great director yet, in this particular case, he has perhaps strayed too far from the original for his own good. Miami's colors are vibrant and beautiful yet, everything here, even when it's sunny, looks a drab green or blue.

Even with a weak plot, it's very hard to understand the dialog overall, up to almost 50% of the time!!??!! The actors are so "restrained" that you end up not feeling anything for them at all.

The chemistry between Colin Farrell's character and Gong Li is barely tepid and I was disappointed in both of their performances. Jamie Foxx is better but not by much. The whole movie is too.... depressing I guess would be the best word.

Overall, I would say this is an interesting movie but not fun and the end result is very disappointing.
