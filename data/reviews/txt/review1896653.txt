Even though I watched this movie on one of them big screens as a kid and kids like everything, even to this day I'd consider it an acceptable movie.The writers, if any, did a good job of making Kamiel Spiessens, a stock character from 30-second skits, an actual person you tend to side with. The plot thickens as he has to leave his farm because an evil capitalist, who to simplify things even further is Dutch, wants to build a giant amusement park. It's up to the delightfully slow-witted Kamiel and his equally uneducated friend Jaak to stop this blessing for the economy. Together with the according to the script beautiful Andrea they think of the absolute lamest plan ever that wouldn't fool a three-year-old who drank paint, but hey it's for kids so it works.But back in that theatre, sitting there with my family all laughing over this dated slapstick hoping everything would turn out alright because kids don't know crap, this is stuff nobody can ever take away from me. And I thank "Oesje" even though a particularly shiny roll of aluminum foil would have probably entertained me as well back then. Nowadays, it still is an incredibly warm, good-hearted movie, just obviously not all that funny anymore.
