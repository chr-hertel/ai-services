An over-the-top take on the corruption, embezzlement and secret societies that affected Italy so badly for so long. This is filmed in black and white to add atmosphere, or make it more Italian or something. The characters make no attempt to speak Italian, or even to put on an Italian accent. In my opinion this adds greatly to the comedy. Their diet consists of a choice between spaghetti hoops or haunted house pasta shapes. Poor Aldo Vini (Nigel Planer), a top banker, has embezzled 200 million, and the net is closing. But that's enough plot for now, no spoilers. Anyway plot isn't as important as the slapstick national stereotypes and farcical locational devices (shot entirely in London, but characters saying things like "I can't stand this Tuscan heat"). Dawn French's character is straight out of a Fellini film.
