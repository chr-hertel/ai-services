I watched this movie when I was about ten years old, so I don't remember much about it, other than that it struck an unpleasant nerve deep inside my subconscious somewhere that lasted until this day. Sure enough, it's been almost twenty years now and my perceptions may be a bit off, but reading some of the other comments, perhaps not. There's just something deeply unsettling about the whole movie, not to mention the ending, which will probably remain etched into my brain for the rest of my life. Makes me uncomfortable just thinking about it. Together with "Jaws" and "Gremlins", this is one of the films my parents shouldn't have let me watched. Anyway, there are so many movies today that are worth watching and probably better than this, but I'd still recommend it for a boring Sunday afternoon.
