When I say that, I am not kidding anyone. Had I knew it earlier, I will have posted my review here beforehand. I had watched it once when it was at the cinemas here (and someone I know actually watched more than once!), watched twice or something when it was on the television here. The last time was like few years back on the television.

It goes to show how much I so love the movie, despite some may think now it's cheesy to bring it up. Hey, this was a box office winner and it's still at the top here in terms of ticket earnings for an opening release of a movie, from what I know. And whenever I heard Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On', I will almost become a drama mama. Literally.

Interstingly, I first remembered back then some years back in my school days, I was doing a comprehension passage about the cruise liner prior to the movie's release and the thing at that time, I had never thought much about the comprehension passage I did after that. I had never thought that it will become a big blockbuster of the time few years later it came out. Till I (even) begged my family that I wanted to go watch it at the cinema (which it happened). I know it's all fiction in the movie about the love story of Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo DiCapirio) before watching it.

The entire movie setting is almost perfect and it will almost bring you back of the era when the actual cruise liner had its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York. Even as I was watching each time, I had often wished I am boarding a luxury cruise liner (still waiting for that day). Anyone can dream.

I have to kind of admit, interestingly, I never cried (but just felt deeply moved then) towards the end of the movie when I first saw it but subsequently when it was on the television here, tears almost started to come out of my eyes.

Almost a real perfect masterpiece. Just don't care what others will say.
