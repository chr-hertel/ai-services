...as Jazmin would say. What is with all the people that voted this movie a "1"? Iceberg lettuce does not equal positive attitudes. Really though, the plot is a only bit far-flung, (though in regards to many other movies, downright realistic.) The main character even reaches her epiphany in a realistic* way and doesn't give a motivational monologue to her co - insert-your-physical-flaw-here friends as the climax of the movie - thank god! A marvelous and funny movie, and that is NOT judging it within the "I'm "fat" and proud" movie genre.

Side Argument: Why is a woman who gains renown through making a movie/TV program about being proud of herself and her body supposed to then go down a few sizes to "look fabulous" on the covers of fashion mags? Hypocritical does not even begin to describe.

*Illusions broken; then chaos coalesces into clarity of purpose and true strength.
