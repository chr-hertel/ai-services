This movie is by far the best i have ever seen. But i gotta admit i almost left the theater in the first 10 minutes. You see, im iraqi and my name is Al-Saleem. It was a bit awkward i felt as if the whole theater was looking at me.

As soon as i got used to that i started enjoying the movie, the plot was amazing. The movie clearly showed amazing understanding the the culture and highlighted cultural differences.

The directing was pretty good. some of the scenes were a bit questionable mainly because i come from the area and know most of the cities and areas in question.

It was a fun movie that makes you think. even after i left i still think there's more to the story than what we have been told.
