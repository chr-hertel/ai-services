Godd movie - lots of twists and turns. The idealism of youth, middle age sensuality, puppy love - all thrown in to make a decent concoction.

Brad and Beth are a final year couple at Wirth - both are ambitious and pursuing their career ambitions with great vigor. Things start getting interesting when Brad runs into an older woman. Little does he know that the woman he is sleeping with is the notorious Duke - his girlfriend's thesis adviser.

Lots of idealism mixed in. The plot never ceases to surprise. Gotta watch it all the way to the end. 

Beth looks cute throughout - pity they don't show enough skin. Lisa isn't bad either - for a middle aged professor. The other couple looks great too - in the end - lots of learning - not enough curves. A bit more of sensuality and this movie would be a big time hit.
