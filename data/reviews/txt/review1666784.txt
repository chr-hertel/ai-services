Rachel McAdams is high powered hotel manager Lisa Reisert.Lisa is about to have a very bad day.on what should be a routine flight,she finds herself a pawn in a political assassination attempt,with no recourse but to do what she is told,or suffer the consequences.this a riveting,compelling,nail biting thriller.for a movie that essentially take place in an airplane with two seats as the setting,this movie works very well.the same sort of tactic was employed in the movie "Phone Booth",where--you guessed it,most of the movie takes place in or near a phone booth.that movie didn't work for me."Red Eye" does,though.there are a few surprising things about this movie.one is it's running time of less than 90 minutes.another is it's relatively mild PG-13 rating.and then,you have Wes Craven as the director.this movie is certainly far removed from most of the blood soaked gore fests that are his usual forte.with all those elements,it was surprising to me that this film works so well.i think that a lot of the credit should go to both McAdams and her co-star Cillian Murphy.McAdams plays the terrified,yet strong woman very credibly and Murphy is brilliant in his role in the piece.but Craven deserves some credit for his deft direction.he makes it seem as if this type of film is a natural fit for him.now.it just goes to show you that with a good script,screenplay(by Carl Ellsworth)and direction, as well as the right actors,you don't need blood and guts to make a successful thriller.i've given away the basic premise but trust me,that won't make the movie any less surprising or enjoyable."Red Eye' gets 9/10 from me
