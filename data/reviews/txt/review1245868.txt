"Memoirs of a Geisha" is a beautifully photographed film with an excellent story. I never read the best-seller but still found the plot to be compelling.

Chiyo and her sister are sold to 2 separate geisha houses to be trained to enter that way of life. In Chiyo's she almost immediately runs afoul of Hatsumomo, who is already a geisha. Hatsumomo is jealous of Chiyo's potential as a geisha and they have a life-long rivalry.

Because of Hatsumomo's conniving and her own attempts to reunite with her sister by running away, Chiyo becomes the slave of the woman running her geisha house. She almost give up hope, but the kindness of "the Chairman", who buys her flavored ice and gives her some money, revives her spirit and Chiyo vows she will someday be a geisha.

When Chiyo is trained as a geisha her name is changed to Sayuri, and she immediately attracts the attention of many men, but she longs only for the Chairman. Her rivalry with Hatsumomo continues, as Hatsumomo and Sayuri's patron both want their protégé's to be "adopted" by the woman running the geisha house.

At film's end, Japan's loss in WW II changes everything. Geisha's become westernized and some are more prostitute than geisha. Sayuri, however, retains hope that someday she might be reunited with "the Chairman" and fall in love.

I think this film has an excellent chance to be nominated for some of the more technical awards - cinematography, make-up, score and others - at the Oscar's. The woman playing Sayuri, Zhi Zyang (?), was nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Actress and she too could be nominated for an Academy Award
