Jerry(William H. Macy)is a poor car salesman who goes to the drastic measures of hiring a couple of goons(Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife so that her wealthy father can pay the ransom and Jerry can split the profits. Problems strike the plan after a pregnant cop named Marge Gunderson(Frances McDormand) takes over the case. Taking place in a desolate town in North Dakota, one can not begin to describe the brutality of this once peaceful area.

The idea of the crime seems so simple but is enforced by the complexity of this frighteningly happy people who are solving the crime. The brutality is given a horrifyingly humorous outlook and makes the movie what it is today. The movie exceeds into the criminals minds and then shows the views of the cop trying to solve the case and the fall guy who is in way over his head. The lighting is absolutely wonderful and really sets the mood with the snowy setting. It gives the movie a dark mood that just scares you when you laugh it. The breath is shown in the air in almost every conversation adding to this effect. The acting was tremendous. I can't and won't even begin to describe the performance of William H. Macy. Overall, the movie is one of those classics that you can admire repeatedly.

I highly recommend this movie.
