OK i had high hopes for this one. Not that Van Damme was in it thou. I've seen his movies and i have to admit that i was a big fan of his many years ago. Bloodsport for ex was a favorite when i was a lot younger then I am today ;) Thou his latest movies have not been much to say the least. So when i looked at the ratings here i was very pleased. "7.7 for a van damme movie?? God damn i have to see this". It started out good with van damme playing a cop that have seen better days. He was not in this movie to show off his ass that was for sure ;) But oh my god.... The acting SUCKED so bad... I can not say that any of the actors on this movie was worth the money seeing this movie. And the story was so predictable. I wont spoil anything for you unlucky people that are going to see this after all but if any of you do not guess the end after 30-40min then I do not know what to say :)

Well good part in this movie was that van damme was more then just a "kick-show-ass" guy in this movie. And well MAYBE he acted a little better then he use to but it is not enough for me anymore. I am sorry but this movie goes down the toilet. Take my advice and spend 1.41h of your life on something more meaningful
