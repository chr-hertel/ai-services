"Mr. 3000" is a one joke movie taken to the extreme. Everyone gets the plot plan. He's selfish, he needs three hits to reach the 3000 hit plateau, and there is going to be friction with his team. Unfortunately that is exactly what happens, and nothing more. Sorely missing is a subplot of some kind, with some interesting characters. There is absolutely no support for Bernie Mac in this movie. The other players grab-ass among themselves. The manager sits in stoic silence. Even Angela Bassett comes across as an afterthought. Mildly amusing at best, redundant and uninspired at worst, "Mr, 3000" was disappointing and a missed opportunity. - MERK
