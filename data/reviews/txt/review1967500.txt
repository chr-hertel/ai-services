A timely message at the close of WWII and one that needed to be told.

Guy Madison is quite the looker but a great actor he is not. But considering this is his first leading role, he does well enough. This was well before my time and I had never heard his name before so it was nice to stumble upon someone considered quite the heartthrob in his day. It's interesting that he ended up married to Gail Russell, who I had heard of, but apparently the marriage didn't last long (she died an early death at 36 due to alcoholism).

Mitchum shows good acting skills early in his career. Dorothy Maguire gives an interesting depiction of a war widow. Sure, she's not the best looking they could have cast here, but I think her "ordinariness" makes her character much more sympathetic and probably helped many real war widows see themselves in her character.

I'm not sure the tidy ending did anyone a service though. I doubt many vets with real problems and issues could tie up there loose ends so neatly, but this is Hollywood.
