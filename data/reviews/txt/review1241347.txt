Wolf Creek is one of the best thrillers of 2005 & one of the best Australian made films of the last few years.

It's lyrical in it's use of landscapes such as barren planes, dark rolling waves to create a sense of dread & foreboding. Ala a previous Aussie classic film Picnic on Hanging Rock.

It's gritty & frightening in basing it's story on the crimes of the backpacker serial killer Ivan Milat & the Falconio murder.

It's takes time to develop it's characters as believable young free spirited travellers.

It builds the tension in subtle ways with lights flashing across the faces of the uncertain, naive faces. Before confronting us with blood, gruesome suggestions & the terror of the victims.
