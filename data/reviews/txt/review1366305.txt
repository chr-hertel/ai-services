This is another show I remember from my youth. I would have been first, second, third grade when it was on.

Saturday evenings, early, around five or six p.m. and again I don't remember the net work it was on.

I didn't realize at that time, it was Tom Bosley who did the father's voice. Of course I remember his best as Howard Cunningham in another 70's series, Happy Days.

I can't seem to explain it with the right words, but... if I had to define the era (early seventies) to a new generation, I would do it with this TV show! I also appreciated that the daughter, although she was heavy set and wore glasses - which by some standards of the time and sadly, still exist today - had a boyfriend!!
