Stop patting these horror movies on the head and giving it a smiley face on it's hand just because they happen to be SOMEWHAT original. Stop encouraging these half baked films. They aren't what they say you are. They are shallow and lifeless.

"But they try!" you say..... "Not nearly hard enough" i say

Only when we all stop supporting these "films" will the studios and filmmakers get the idea and perhaps start actually making an effort.

And seriously....the worst bats special effect since the first batman. And what a lovely lens flare on the credits......When will everyone stop giving accolades to these horrible horrible films that do and say nothing?
