I saw a sneak preview of Australia Thursday night at the magnificent Art Deco AFI/Silver Theater in Silver Spring MD. Between the film and the theater I felt transported back to 1939, when films were big, expansive productions. This film felt like all the classic film genres rolled into one - the Romance, the Western, the WWll War Film, and a touch of screwball comedy. The villains are really bad and the good guys were all PC. Australia is true to the heart with none of the snarky cynicism of contemporary films. Just when you think the film has hit an almost surreal bucolic ending - you have another hour to go and what an hour - everything is tossed in the air. All the actors were good, particularly the young boy who played Nullah, a child actor who was genuinely a child. The balance of the western world and aboriginal world is well maintained, with due respect given to the aboriginal culture and an unflinching look at the mistreatment they suffered at the hands of the white culture. There is enough imagery, symbolism, references, and analogies to keep you thinking and talking for days. And you'll never listen to Somewhere Over the Rainbow the same way again. There is one discreet sex scene and some not so discreet verbal references to sex bu nothing to offend. For all the chatter about the budget and schedule and ending(s) - Baz Luhmann has created a classic. Australia never looked better, grand epic vistas, and stunning cinematography. I wish Australia the country weren't so very far away. Don't read the storyline or too many reviews in advance, go in and enjoy the story as it unfolds, 2 3/4 hours will fly by without you checking your watch. If you like old films, big films, films that make you feel like you have just spent 2+ hours of your life in a good way - go see Australia. It is well worth the price of admission.
