Prior to watching Superman III, I had heard many people brand it a complete turkey, but I was willing to give it a chance anyway because I'm a fan of several "underdog" movies in long-running franchises (e.g. Alien 3, Star Trek V, Rocky V...) 

But this movie really is bad. The plot feels very random and cobbled together. The villains chuck all kinds of obstacles into Superman's path - including a weather-manipulating satellite, artificially engineered Kryponite, oodles of missiles, and a malicious supercomputer - but most of these threats are underdeveloped, impersonal and dull.

The only sort-of-interesting sequence involves Superman splitting into "good" and "evil" doubles, who get in a fistfight in a junkyard. It's a somewhat surreal and effective bit of spectacle. But, on the other hand, the scene doesn't make much sense, and since it's merely a fight it can't really qualify as an intelligent exploration of the character's duality.

Richard Pryor, meanwhile, fails to make any kind of impression whatsoever. He's amusing in some scenes, but on the whole his jokes - and the movie's overall sense of humor - come across as dated and "precious" (read: annoying). Take, for example, the scene when Pryor slings a tablecloth around his shoulders like a "cape" and tries to imitate Superman. It ain't funny, it just looks stupid.

The special effects are another disappointing aspect. The missiles seem like something out of a Godzilla movie, while the various ray-beams look like they come from Forbidden Planet (I mean no disrespect to that movie - only to the much later Superman III!) 

One good thing about Superman III is that it helped me to appreciate director Richard Donner's take on the character more. The first Superman film does feature some silly comedy moments, but it also has some dignity and genuine drama. Superman III, on the only hand, is just two hours of silliness and stupidity. It's not witty, it's a condescending bore.
