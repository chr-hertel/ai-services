i thought this sequel to Are We There Yet was pretty good.it's a bit funnier.it's based on the classic movie Mr.Blandings builds his dream House,but it also has a lot of the Money Pit thrown in.John C. McGinley is very funny in his role.i don't want to say what that role is,because that would be spoiling things.but trust me,he's pretty funny.as with the first movie,this one is predictable,so there's no surprise how it will end.there's a bit of innuendo here,but no bad language.i'm surprised at the low rating(2.8/10) which in my mind is nowhere near fair.for me,this is a movie that is pretty much good for the whole family.i give Are We Done Yet? a 6/10
