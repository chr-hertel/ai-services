This film is a strange one, but I found it highly original. It keeps you in suspense all the way through, and there certainly are a few twists within the plot as the film goes along, that I certainly didn't expect. Some scenes might make you uncomfortable, (even a little sick!) and others might make you jump, but to me, what gives this film it's originality, is the actual plot.....I haven't seen another horror film deliver the story quite like this one....

A good thrilling film.

I must say, that I heard they were making a sequel, and I think that's a bad idea.....After watching till the end of the film, it would be much scarier if they just left it, which when you have watched it, you might see why...
