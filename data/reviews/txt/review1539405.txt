I'm making this comment in answer to the summary above where the poster states he didn't like the ending.. OK, everyone to their own, but personally I thought QL had the best ending of any show I've ever seen.

There was just so much happening you've got to pay attention, but it's certainly worth it...

When Shtopaw leaps... wow what a twist, I got totally blindsided by that, I just did not see it coming. Great stuff.

Also pay attention to the end credits.. that pic isn't a stock frame, Scott and Dean stood for those 30 sec and smiled to us.. as if to say..'Goodbye, and thanks for watching. It was a really nice touch and I know I appreciated it.

(Best Cartman voice) I love those guys.
