I love Bogart. I love Bacall. I love Chandler. I love Philip Marlowe.

I used to think I loved The Big Sleep. I used to TELL people I loved The Big Sleep. But tonight, ten or fifteen years later, I don't love it anymore.

They all seem to have memorized their lines that afternoon, right before the shoot. There is almost no reaction to each other, and I mean everybody. They talk too fast, as if they were copying the "ambience" of His Girl Friday, which was already "dated" about ten minutes after filming.

This is not acting. This is Pushing Them Out, at maybe the rate of ten or so per year.

The screenplay is a mess; it seems to have been re-written a dozen times by a dozen different people. I can't believe William Faulkner had something to do with this screenplay, but they claim he did.

But there IS something to love about this film. It's the cars.

This movie has the greatest cars of any Forties b/w film. Has Jay Leno seen this movie? Somebody call him and clue him in. These are terrific cars in this movie. I think I'll watch them again.
