I love "The Closer", "Navy NCIS" and "Numbers". The story lines, actors/actresses, characters, and locations are fantastic.

Kyra Sedgwick is not the actress I would have picked for "Brenda Lee", and I would like Chief Pope to leave the show permanently, but I enjoy the heck out of Flynn, Provenza, Sanchez, Daniels, and "Brenda's right-hand man" (whose name escapes me at the moment).

I would love to see "Brenda's lover" have a more complete role in the future, as I just love "Fritzi". What a hunk!

Flynn and Provenza are my absolute favorites from the cast and I love the repartee the two engage in on every show, especially the first seasons when Provenza made a point of cleaning his desk of anything that was not his (usually something Flynn had put there).
