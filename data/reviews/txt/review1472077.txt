Considering this is a short film it is very hard to write a lot without giving too much away. But I'll give it a shot.

This is a very good film, the acting is very good, both Gael Garc√≠a Bernal (Jose Francisco) and Kevin Knapman (Mark) give excellent performances. The plot is good as well, which is based on a true story.

The story is about a British soldier (Mark) who suddenly gets held hostage by an Argentinean Soldier (Jose Francisco) who out of both of them is the only one carrying a gun, during the Falkland War.

They cant communicate with each other properly as the British Soldier can't speak Spanish and the Argentinean Soldier can't speak that much English, but it soon becomes very clear that they are both scared and all both of them want to do is to leave the war and go back home with their loved ones.

But sadly for one of them, that is never going to happen. With drastic consequences for their loved one's when they receive a nightmare in a form of a letter.

This film tells us that there is no sides that are all good and all bad in a war.

It's a must see, and even if you wont like it, it's only 16 minutes long, so it wont take away a lot of your time. But I recommend everyone to see this, it's a very tense film with a great ending.
