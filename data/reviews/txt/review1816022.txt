This film tells the story of a series of murders based on the real case of "el Petiso Orejudo" in Argentina in the early part of the 20th century. It's filmed from the point of view of another child, who has the visions of the murders. Or is he the real killer? Maribel Verdu is understated in her portrayal of a poor woman in a chauvinistic society trying to cope with a jealous lover and son who's claims are suspicious to say the least. Abel Ayala is excellent in his role as a pathetic kid born into misery and poverty.

On the whole a fine film, good actors and an interesting story, well directed make for a good watch as the story develops to it's tragic end.
