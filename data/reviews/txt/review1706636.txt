I had opportunity to watch this film several times on TV. Each time it was able to capture me. The story is very realistic and touchy. It is so successful at telling hypocritical morality of a conservative "Turkish family. The pressure implied on women for keeping family honor" whereas conniving mistreatment of those women. Such mistreatment lead Uftade, the youngest daughter of the family and the aunt of the story teller- become schizophrenia over years. The film also allow us to observe the daily life of a low income Turkish family in early 1980s, see appearances of the country from those years and lead to nostalgia. All players are so successful.
