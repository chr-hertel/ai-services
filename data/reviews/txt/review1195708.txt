I'm a Stereo fan from back in the day. Soon after I started skating I was shown the original Stereo video 'A Visual Sound'... it was so different from anything I had ever seen (as far as skate videos or anything else is concerned)... that I was quickly hooked on the company and it's philosophy on skating. Unfortunately, Stereo had gone under by the time I saw 'Sound.' Lee was already off making flicks in Hollywood and Pastras was at school. Still, I got my hands on 'Tin Can Folklore' (the other original Stereo video) and watched it nearly daily for about a year.

I was fairly realistic (I thought) and realized that Stereo would probably never return. But here it is, nearly a decade later, Stereo is back. 'Way Out East' has all the flare and intelligence that the previous videos had but now it has matured into a style completely its own. Gone are the jazz tracks, replaced by Midlake (a fair trade, both work great for this team). There are three young cats in this video with a ton of that signature Stereo style. Keegan Sauder is all over the map with his tech style and interesting terrain choices. Benny Fairfax is one of those guys who does simple stuff... just BIGGER, awesome flow. Clint Peterson is an all-around brilliant skater with a lanky tilt. Plus, you get some old school type stuff with Pastras and even a little Lee for good measure. It's been tough looking for good vids since Stereo left but it's time to rejoice... STEREO IS BACK!
