Brilliant storytelling, refreshing, moving and charming! Let's not forget Maggie Gyllenhall (sp?) she's exquisite as a cookie enchantress and rebel Goddess! Dustin Hoffman is genius - Will Ferrell seems to have taken acting lessons from Jack Webb and Emma Thompson - is forever the greatest actress of our day - comedic and otherwise (ok - Meryl is good too - can someone get them together in a film?) This is a classic film reminiscent of the 30's and 40's - but with contemporary story telling... We loved it - will see it again and really I want to own this one! 

A real gem of a movie...
