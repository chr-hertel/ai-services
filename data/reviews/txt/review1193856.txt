I was lucky enough to see this movie last night at the International Hispanic Film Festival in Palm Desert.

I absolutely loved it.

I found it to be very engaging and upbeat. No matter what stereotype of people they were showing(Mexican, southern, gay, etc) it was always in a positive light.

I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and found myself very engaged with each character. Well written, and very well told story.

I hope to see it in theaters soon nationally and I want to know when the Jesus the Driver video game comes out too.
