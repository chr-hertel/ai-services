The genius of Corey Haim is once again on display in the epic motion picture. Following his thunderous performance in Demolition High, the university sequel is all it is cracked up to be. Yes they made 2 of these movies. Demo high and Demo U. And the 36 year old Haim is steals the show. I watched this movie and couldn't believe my eyes. The terrorists look like guys from Sicily and Haim's love interest is the girl from a crappy Tony Danza Movie. That is why it is so special. Lenny slater steps it up again, only this time in a college setting, that we see for all of 10 minutes. One main thing missing was Alan Thicke(growing pains pop) who was Haim's father in Demo High. If you want to laugh and be perplexed at the same time, watch this movie.
