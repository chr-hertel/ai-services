This movie will teach us people in our teenage years that if we do not control our obsessions, they can lead us to dangerous situations when we are betrayed by our loved ones and then we seek revenge on those who betray us. Trust me! It's true! This film was released in the year 2002, the year when I was accused of stalking an older boy when I was only trying to be friendly, and whenever harsh rumors flew around the school, I blamed it right on that person who I wanted to be friends with so much. And then, things started to get real creepy!! I wanted to murder him, I wanted to follow him where ever he went to intimidate him. Oh my God! It was terrible!!!! And to this day, I wonder if that guy and his friends probably picked it up from this film, I wonder.....
