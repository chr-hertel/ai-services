One of the things because I love this episode, it's because of the soundtrack, where we can gear "Human Touch", and excellent song, that had to do a lot with the story of the abandoned child.

Later he discovered that he was not meant to be abandoned, she was just being protected by the family when a ghost demon showed up and wanting to kill the baby, even when he just killed the whole male members of the family, he was chasing the baby, but this was being protected by the Charmed Ones.

I hope you enjoy this episode as well as I did, trust me, this is one of the best from the second season.

I always rather Paige over Prue!
