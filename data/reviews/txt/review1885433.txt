This episode of Gunsmoke, which only briefly features Festus, Marshall, and Newly is a well thought out and exciting episode. Travis Colter and his family are in between a rock and a hard space. Two of Travis's brothers are on the run outlaws and one has already been hanged. His mother can't stand losing another son. Travis faces discrimination because of his name, and to his chagrin, his mother has to start working in the saloon. Thus begins a long road for Travis, who has his personal obstacles to overcome. Jan-Michael Vincent and the late Kim Hunter give terrific performances, and make "The Legend" a great Gunsmoke episode to watch.
