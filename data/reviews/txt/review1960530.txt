I watched this movie for the first time tonight, my eyes were on this movie every second. I watched it from start to finish and I'm still amazed right now after watching the movie. The main point of the movie was to me, the viewer.

The attitude and responses Alex was giving is a personality of his own, he was himself and he showed he had style in his own way.

I was stunned at times, The movie kept me sometimes on the edge of my chair waiting for the next thrill to happen, knowing I'm going to be absolutely surprised again and again.

This movie is an absolute masterpiece, A movie which i enjoyed and a movie that didn't waste my time.
