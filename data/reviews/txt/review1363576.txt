In this sequel to The Fly, Andre Delambre's son is grown up and takes over his father's experiments, much to the chagrin of his Uncle Francois, once again played by Vincent Price. As you may well have guessed, the same thing happens all over again, and Phillipe Delambre's head and arm are swapped with a fly. Isn't that a funny coincidence, that the same thing happens again to the son of the original guy? What are the chances? The Return of the Fly quite simply doesn't have the same emotional depth or the same quality of plot at all. The Fly in this film is a giant lumbering idiot that just attacks people for no reason at all. They even add a stupid moment in the film where a man goes through the teleportation pod with a gerbil and comes out with gerbil paws. What's the point? To use up special effects.

The direction, plot, and acting are terrible this time around, and it doesn't have the same feel as the original. It was also a big mistake to make this film in black and white after the original film was done is full colour. Ridiculous.
