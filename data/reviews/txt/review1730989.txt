I think this is the best movies of the 90's. Great humor from Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley. Who knew? Also, the comedy great Tim Allen used his line from Toy Story "I come in peace." Has anyone noticed that yet? This is the best Tim Allen performance I've seen so far. Thanks and also I'd like to say that they should do a sequel of this movie somehow. I first watched this movie about 2 years ago and fell in love with it immediately. Kirstie Alley always does her best to keep herself looking so good in movies I think. I definitely would recommend this movie to my friends and to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. Keep up the good work Tim Allen.
