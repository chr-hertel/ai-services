First let me say i am a white male, whether or not race or sex enters into if you like this movie or not i don't know,from the people who love this movie i wonder if i was watching a different movie altogether I thought it was a terrible movie (i have seen comments like love conquers all-yeah right-i did not take this away from the movie it had no point it was like watching queenie, cotton club and 28 days later all wrapped into 1 movie), the lead actress halle b., acting career has gone in a downward spiral from catwoman to TV movies, she seems only capable of the queenie accent, I thought I was watching a zombie movie for a while, I can not believe that some folks think this is so good it had no point what a waste, I think of movies with black actors such as, roots,which i consider one of the greatest of all time , boyz in the hood, even the the color purple or Morgan freeman in so many other movies , this was a boring movie from the beginning and toward the end it got to be what I would term a zombie movie( I think I saw 28 days later)i kept waiting for him to bite her and her bite the whole camp and the whole state of Florida become rabies central(better than gators i suppose) , how bad was this?to me I thought it could possibly be the worst movie I have seen in years on TV ever!!!! oprah seems to have more money than sense and the movies she makes are so predictable (the black woman is a super hero all they need is tights and to fly)after watching this so called movie i want my 2 1/2 hours back what a waste -how can anyone have liked this? or got more out of it nothing great here in fact nothing average here well below average down right terrible no point ,it was much worst than the 5 people you meet in heaven, this is only my opinion and I will give it 1 star out of 10
