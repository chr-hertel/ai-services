Well talk about a movie to really make you think, well folks this is it. I mean the Bible, Jesus,Mary Magdeline, the Pope, just to name a few, the Knights Templar, The Crusades. It's a lot to take in but let's try, I can buy the fact that their could be a conspiracy i mean just look at the Catholic Church, now i was raised protestant, and haven't been to church in many years, after being made to go as a kid, but the point is, the corruption in the church, Jesus was 33 when he died, you mean to tell me he never had sex,, course he did, he was mortal i believe, him having a kid, i'll buy that much. I liked the first 1:45 of the movie, then well it seemed to me that too much was revealed at the wrong time, making it less than suspenseful after that. I loved the character of Silas, played by Paul Bettany, Tom Hanks character i liked very much. seeking the truth, very studious, always thinking, i respect that. I absolutely think Jean Reno shined in this movie, he is one of the best French actors today. I think that this movie came too quickly after the book, I haven't read the book, but i will someday. The movie took us to magical places. Westminster Abby, the Louvre, just to name 2 . All in all like i said a great thriller, mystery. lots of intrigue, for the first hour and forty five mins.. after that well, it just didn't work for me. but that's me.
