Very long time since I saw this movie & I was only around 17 but for reasons unknown it has stuck in my mind. Having just done a web search there is little material available & it seems to have become something of a lost movie. Octavia is a blind girl who has lived in a protected environment. She has not experienced much of life. One day a guy on the run from the law breaks into her world, kidnaps her & takes her on a trip that will broaden her horizons...... Don't want to say more about the plot as I don't want to spoil the film for anyone who tracks it down - also its so long ago I may be wrong about a few details.... What I strongly remember is the dreamlike quality of the film that gave it some individuality (& Octavias sad monologues) & the almost religious irony of the plot - fans of "Lets Scare Jessica To Death" would probably get a similar vibe from this one. Hope some distribution company "rediscovers" this one for DVD release.
