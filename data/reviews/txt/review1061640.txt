When anyone uses the word 'masterpiece', usually- (as with the phrases;'trust me' or 'dont look') the opposite opinion is encouraged. But with this in mind, never has a movie deserved it's use. 'Bladerunner' for me was and always shall be a riveting watch, from it's stunning visuals to the utter 'vastness' of it's Vangelis soundtrack, it remains the perfect example of 'sum greater than it's parts.' Let's be honest here, split it into it's integral parts and you have the potential for a big-fat-turkey. Sci-fi has to work that much harder anyway, but with 'Bladerunner' things such as an over-baring and sometimes obtrusive score, bad acting, continuity inconsistencies, budget difficulties, the terrible narrative, re-writes, on set arguments? somehow Ridley Scott pulled it off. The movie set the standard, sci-fi COULD be Exiting, scary, sexy and even heart warming, using film making skill- not shiny robots, lasers and big baddies in black.
