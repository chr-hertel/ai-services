I just don't get it. I enjoy campy movies a lot of the time but this one... I just don't get it. Maybe if I saw it back in the 80's it would have been different but I saw this for the first time last night--my friend loves it--and I can't see how anyone (the Times reporter quoted on the box seemed to think this was the greatest action movie ever)can think it's more than... more than... I don't even know. The comedy, what little I noticed, was delivered and directed poorly--the time was off so often. The plot development and character development was pathetic. I've never heard so many characters suddenly stop and spend a minute to rant to the ignorant hero about what was going on. (On second, I have to go downstairs and fight the evil demon who was just released from hell by my next door neighbor who says evil chants every night from a black book he found while walking along a dark alley many years ago that was being guarded by 2 ninjas who were trained by an ancient master who happens to be coming after my head.) Now, sometimes that can be funny or at least amusing. And, obviously a lot of people must think that, in this case, it is... but it seemed so accidental. So much like they didn't notice they were making a bad movie. So.... I just don't get what everyone sees in this!!!!!
