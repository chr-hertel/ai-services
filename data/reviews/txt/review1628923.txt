It's a horror comedy that is plenty of gore scenes and pretty nice jokes too. However the plot seems to be a little silly and doesn't bring anything new to the genre. In fact, what I liked the most was definitely the corrosive humour that is really funny at parts. The kind of jokes used is the commonly used in the dark comedies (or horror comedies) but are very well conceived and are very sarcastic. Especially the Mayor character, it's excellent. But, on the other hand, the "part" of the movie connected to the horror is not so good (except some good gore scenes), because it is nothing special. It's just a zombies' flick with these little "monsters" (in this case slugs) from the outer space. I don't know but it all seemed a bit foolish to me
