Evil dead 4 There is a good chance this will be made Bruce Campbell, Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert have all said they want to make this movie. The prob is that Sam Raimi is very busy with other big movies like spiderman 3 and and other big movies 2 come. At the moment and he has no time to make this movie. it looks like if it goes a head it will be prob 3 or 4 years away.

The talk is evil dead 4 might be called Army of Darkness II.

We just have to wait for the Evil Dead Remake. Bruce Campbell said this remake will get made.
