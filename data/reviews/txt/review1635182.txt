We here in the viewing public are so desperate for something unique in our cinema, that anything different is considered genius. This movie fails in so many ways, and yet because it introduces unique makeup and costume and violence to make even the most hardened of viewers squirm, we are tricked into thinking it brilliant. Yet, it has no point, it has no depth, it is filled with trickery. It is a horror film, a nightmare in the guise of a young girls fantasy. This is not a young girls mind, this is one of man. It kinda sickened me. None of the characters are developed, (except the vilest) none of the heroes are to be trusted, the faun is evil and dark...the happy ending is mired in Christian/fascist symbolism, with a man on a throne with a long white beard sits in an auditorium with an audience clapping. The wool pulled over our eyes through theatrics. Where is the heart..missing.
