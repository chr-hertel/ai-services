I just saw the bond film and thought it was outstanding! One quick observation though: did anyone else notice a quick cameo by Richard Branson, Billionaire owner of Virgin Airways? I think I saw him in the scene in the Miami airport as Bond was heading through the metal detector screening area. I know it's not a big deal but someone else take a look and let me know what you think.

Considering the plot point at that time in the movie it kind of makes sense that he would be there. After that time I kept looking for other cameos and the camera seemed to linger on some other characters but I didn't recognize anyone else. 

The movie was great, though. I heard one critic say that it was made kind of in the same vein as the Bourne series. I concur.
