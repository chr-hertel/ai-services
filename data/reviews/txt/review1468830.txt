There really isn't much to say about this movie except you'll be waiting for it to end after the first scene. The only thing that keeps your attention is Sharon Stone's hot 50 year old body --which you don't get to see until the final few scenes. The movie ends so ridiculously that you wish you hadn't watched it to begin with. This movie is about as good as the first which doesn't say much. It's nothing to be remembered except for a 50 year old's body who looks like she's 30. Need plastic surgery or a cool haircut? Rent this movie. Want to watch a good movie? Don't rent this. It's a waste of 4 bucks and even a bigger waste if you buy it.
