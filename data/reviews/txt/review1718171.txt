This is cool - a tour of the house and the field used in Field Of Dreams. The people who own and live in the house give tours of the place in Dyersville, Iowa. Actually, two families own the entire property but the Lansings own most of it and are featured in this "tour" that is part of the Anniversary Edition DVD.

Boy, they've really made it a commercial production, with a souvenir building and a lot of signs, but that's okay because it least it has given thousands a people a chance to see this place and it is free of charge to use the diamond. I admit I would love to go out there and step on that diamond and sit on the bleachers looking out at the ballpark and cornfields. It has to be a thrill. The folks they interview all seem all excited.

There is a local team, too! They call themselves "The Ghost Players." They come out of the cornfields and entertain the crowd. They have the same old uniforms. It's pretty amazing. They've become somewhat famous, traveling all over the world. Even in Japan there was a sign welcoming them saying, "If you build it, they will come." I love it! 

Unlike most bonus features on a film, this one features all "average" people being interviewed, those who own the property and some of the over one million people who have come to visit these "hallowed grounds" in Iowa.
