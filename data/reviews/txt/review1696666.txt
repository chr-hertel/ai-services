This is an near perfect movie featuring Robert Howard's most famous character. It contains some of the best music ever produced for a film score and fleshes out its lead characters admirably. In many ways, it mirrors Howard's original Hyborian world with somewhat muted fantasy elements, beautiful women, violence, revenge, sword fights, and fatalistic philosophy. It doesn't completely follow Howard's design for Conan but instead drifts off in an overtly Nietzschean direction with Conan becoming an avenging ronin battling an evil sorcerer and merciless vikings. Both Conan and Valeria are empathetic if incredibly violent and somewhat exaggerated characters, while the theme of strength gained through adversity and vengeance gained through sheer perseverance--the most distinctly Nietzschean aspect of the film--is apparent from beginning to end. Had Milius made this more like Howard's Hyborian Conan rather than adding much philosophy and an eastern warrior code not present in the original work, it would definitely rate a 10. As it stands, though, it is a brilliant piece of work in its own right and stands well even now a quarter century after its initial appearance.
