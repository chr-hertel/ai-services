The idea of engaging in a duel to the death is ingrained in many a young man, throughout the world. No place more so than the Fatherland. During the First World War, notable families selected the air as the new social arena to establish family honor. Thus was established the persona of the aerial Aristocrat, a 'Knight of The Air'. Selecting what would become the ideal traits of chivalry and honor, each new recruit sought to emulate past heroes. The do's and don't's was perhaps taken as a matter or 'breeding' and each man was expected to adhere to them, in the Tutonic Quest for the ultimate prize. In this film, "The Blue Max", we have the World conflict called the First World War in which nations collide with nations for dominance. Enter Bruno Stachel (George Pepard) who desires to take his place as the finest air combat pilot of the war. When he begins to show promise in the deadly air sport, other pilots, (Jeremy Kemp as Willi Von Klugermann) Karl Michael Vogler as Colonel Otto Heidemann and Anton Diffring) of Noble bearing, remind him to take the time to honor each fallen foe. This seems ridiculous, as he reminds them, that when he was a foot soldier in the trenches, "The dead were so numerous, no one ever took the time to honor the truck-loads of dead soldiers." As the contest of death continuous, he is seen as having no cultural breeding and is ostracized. Stachel, ignores them and sets his mind on obtaining the coveted prize irregardless of the cost. A trait which will cost him more than he supposes. The film aerial fights are good, but difficult to follow. The story is close to social conflicts and we see what others will do to remain aloof. ****
