A Warner Brothers Short Subject.

THE MONROE DOCTRINE asserts the rights of the Americas to be left alone from all European entanglements.

This little film gives a good look at the reasons behind the Monroe Doctrine and how it was defined by succeeding American governments. It moves briskly and is well acted, especially by Grant Mitchell as John Quincy Adams and Sidney Blackmer as Teddy Roosevelt. Nanette Fabray & George Reeves very briefly portray young lovers caught up in history's flow.

Often overlooked or neglected today, the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents, both in front & behind the camera. The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film, something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel. Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material, short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios' feature films.
