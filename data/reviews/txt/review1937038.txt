An unemployed defence worker played by Michael Douglas has a serious problems in his personal life. Instead of trying to fix them he rather unleash his anger on other people. I don't think that makers of this film were trying to make a hero out of him (not like some other people think). If you don't like food in this restaurant, you go to eat somewhere else, if you think that prise for a batteries is to high in this store, you go and buy them in some other store, you don't start to shoot everybody around for that. William Forster is a person with unstable state of mind who one day just snap. Althou in some situations he was right like in that 'skinhead situation', but most of the situations were a lot of noise over nothing. Anyway it was really fun to watch him walking from place to place and and beating crap from everybody.
