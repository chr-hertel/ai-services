This is Kevin Spacey's tribute to Bonny Darin.

It honours them both.

The film is superb.

It does not pretend to be unremittingly accurate, "true to life". It shows Darin's life as Darin himself might have seen it. He would certainly have approved of the film - maybe his shade does.

Surely no other actor/director/writer/producer could have done such justice to such an amazing story. Spacey sings and dances with an exuberance that is infectious. People who've never heard of Darin should be beguiled by the film and learn more. And they will.

See it!
