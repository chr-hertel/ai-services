King Kong was the best movie by far that I have ever seen. It was just so action-packed, so chair clinching that I would defenitlely recommend it.

The part where Kong faces off with the t-rexes is just so crazy and he manages to kill all of them even with Ann in his hand, sure they bit him a couple of times but you couldn't even notice.

The end is pretty sad but I'm not going to give it away. Part of the movie was scary just when they meet the natives it was just so scary well not really that scary but just weird. Well I guess thats what you get from someone who directed lord of the rings.
