Playing a lying game can be fun, but the consequences are great when it goes too far. This lying game was anything, but fun. A transplant from England named Owen(Julian Morris) comes to this Academy to learn journalism. There he meets this clique who get together to play this game called "Wolf & Sheep". It fun when the wolf is marked, and they have to figure out who's the wolf and who's the sheep. It's a game that can be fun for starters. I liked the last person who flashed her boyfriend for distrusting her. Others had to flash to show any mark to show if he/she is the wolf. To me, that game is just a teaser. Then the invent a killer, who turned out to be anything but a figment of one's imagination. Everyone knows something is wrong, and the prank just gone way out of hand when the teacher(Jon Bon Jovi), gets involved. The leader Dodger(Lindy Booth) looks like she can be trusted, or can she? To me it's like a lesson learned, who to trust, who not to trust, who can you trust? Lying games is the one game I would rather avoid. Neutrality is the best bet! Great movie, great plot! Great cast as well! Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
