Very well made film that takes historical literature and brings it to life with a modern twist. Brings out very important phobias and misunderstandings of our world today. Brilliantly made film that is constantly reminding the viewer how it compliments the ideas it supports. It's crowning achievement is that it is a complete that shows how manipulation is easier than we may have ever realized. Some will come out of the film without realizing that they have been affected, but if they understand the message of the film it will be hard for them to digest news and their government as easily as they have before. I will surely spend my 7 dollars again and watch with equal interest and enlightenment.
