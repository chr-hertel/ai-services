Firstly I confess I am a huge Wilco fan and might be a little biased based on that! I've seen a few documentaries that follow around a band and try to capture something worthy of a feature-length documentary(radiohead's documentary 'meeting people is easy' for one example) and I'm always disappointed at how little band access they seem to have. This time, I didn't have that feeling at all. I think that Jeff Tweedy and the rest of wilco were really open and let us into their world. The story is told in such a way that you don't even realize that there is a story for the first thirty minutes or so. I like that. I don't think the story of wilco's best album could have been told any other way. If you hate the record industry, if you love great music, if you like a documentary filmmaker who knows how to keep his subject and not himself as the focus of his film (Michael Moore take note!) Then this is the film for you. It feature some amazing wilco concert footage that will make you fall in love with the band if you aren't already!
