There is a breach in the security system of the Luthor mansion, and while running to the panic room with Lana, Lex vanishes. Sooner he finds that he is invisible, trapped in another frequency by the meteor freak and former electrician Bronson that wants to disclose to the world the experiments of the LuthorCorp's secret laboratory 33.1. Meanwhile Clark is informed by Chloe that the entire crew of the vessel was found dead in Seattle and he discovers that they have been slaughtered by the starving Zoner Aldar that feeds of human bones.

In "Static", there are two parallel stories: the first one about a man seeking revenge on Lex, and the relationship of the always weepy Lana Lang and her present lover Lex. The other one is about a dangerous and powerful Zoner that is vanquished by a mysterious man with abilities. Who is the saver of Clark and what will happen to Lana's baby are the greatest questions left in this reasonable episode. My vote is seven.
