I really did not like this film.

I usually like quirky independent films, but this was more like watching the cartoon "King of the Hill," than "The Station Agent," Me and You and Everyone We Know," or "Pieces of April." 

The problem with "Junebug" is that there are no likable characters. I just saw a bunch of stereotyped dumb Southerners that really had no good qualities. I guess that was supposed to be funny, but I wasn't laughing. Madeleine, the Northener, was real nice and understanding, but there was not much depth to her character. Her Southern husband was hardly in the film and we are not given any reason why they got married other than physical attraction.

Sitting through this film for an hour and 40 minutes was an unpleasant experience. The photography was rather plain, the dialog was forgettable, and the ending did not resolve anything. The acting was good, but not good enough to save the film.

Apparently lots of people like this film because it has gotten pretty good reviews. Maybe those are the people who have kept "King of the Hill" on the air for so long.
