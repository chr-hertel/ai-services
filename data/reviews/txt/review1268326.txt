Aside from Robert Mitchum, the acting in this mini-series ranges from poor to bad, especially in the case of Ali MacGraw. However, the story and the high production quality balances or even outweighs the bad acting. Overall, it kept me interested, mainly because I liked seeing how the war gradually enveloped the world, and I gained a better perspective on how the war affected people in various circumstances.

One thing that put me off, besides the acting, was at one point, the character of FDR makes a comment that is supposed to lead the audience to believe that he wished he could change the immigration laws to allow more Jewish refugees to enter the U.S. Official government records show that year after year during the German persecution of Jews, the U.S. only filled a little over half of its immigration quota and turned away thousands of these people that the law would have allowed to enter the country.

All-in-all, I think it's worth watching if you enjoy this genre, and I'm glad to have seen it. It's eighteen hours long, and was in production for three years. Shot on locations around the world, and with over 300 speaking parts in the script, it's a big one!
