first of all i would like to say this movie sucks 100 balls 

warning this may spoil a huge disappointment the first problem with this movie is none of the fights were even close to believable, like the fight on the boat which people just leap of the boat when in real life they would have all had guns. the fight between between Tina and her dad he did't care at all that he lost and it seemed like he was there just to look silly . the villain was a joke who just stole other people's fighting skills in mortal kombat except on a lame way though stupid pair of sunglasses. the romantic scenes were atrociously corny lime something out of a third rate episode of Lizzie Maguire is an insult to any adult watching. the end part were the the leap off the a building in to water was pathetic when they landed they when't hurt or even wet , at he end they show a bunch of clips from the movie just frikken watched,what do they think i forgotten everything about the movie already ? bottom this movie is frikken pathetic
