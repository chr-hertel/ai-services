This show is one of the funniest shows I've seen in a long time. I may be only 14, but lets just say I watch too much television. The show has a variety of sketches, ranging from funny to completely hilarious. Everyone on the show is funny, and the sketches always seem to me like the new funniest thing that i have ever seen. It continues to make me laugh. I find it mostly original, and if it ever dipped into unoriginal it certainly was funnier or better than whatever the other thing was. It had me and my friends and everyone I know quoting it. It's extremely hard not to! It never gets tiresome or boring, like many shows have, and I'm sure it might never get tiresome and boring. Bottom line-totally hilarious.
