I went to Toronto to watch the stage opera 12 years ago and was drawn to the music part of the opera at that time.

I recently found out about the DVD version of the movie and watched it again. What a great movie! Knowing little about the movie production, I thought the singing was dubbed and were surprised to learn that the actors were actually singing throughout the show.

Since I have no idea of what Phontam and Christine should have been, I felt that the cast members did a great job portraying each character. The movie brought the story close to me. The vocal part for all the actors and actress were just fantastic. I was even more surprised to find out that this is the first musical that Gerald Butler was on and he has done such a superb job. I hope to see future musical productions from Gerald, and Emmy of course.

I went back and listened to the sound track recorded at London and concluded that the movie version is different - more real and less theatrical and better.

I have been and will continue to recommend this movie to my friends and people I know.
