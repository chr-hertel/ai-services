First, the movie itself was just a transparent knock against the free enterprise system in general. Can't recall the number of times that free market advocacy was fronted as the root cause of the fraud while state-run, socialist enterprises are presented as morally superior. Critical thinkers and those without a political agenda would realize that fraud, corruption and 'greed' can and will be found anywhere and everywhere human ambition is present. Which, of course, is almost anywhere and everywhere.

What I was hoping for in this movie, instead of a polemic, was more detail and intricacy on how these schemes were set up and what about them was 'smart'. We only saw what was corrupt in them -- which frankly, got boring.

Second, I wonder if anyone really felt sympathetic for the linemen who "lost" $350,000 in his retirement account -- or the hundreds of others like him. It was their decision to put their money into company stock, rather than in safer choices that I'm sure were available -- and you can bet no one complained during the time that the value of their accounts went UP by several hundred percent. My only real sympathy was for the poor who were victims of the energy manipulation perpetrated by Enron.

Lastly, the irony of showcasing Bill Lerach, good Democrat, good trial lawyer and now, convicted felon as the tongue-clucking attorney for the shareholders was choice. Of course, all that happened after the film was released.

Still, I'll be waiting for an expose from the producers on Lerach entitled "The Sleaziest Guy in the Room". But I won't hold my breath.

And I wonder if far more innocent people got hurt by Lerach and crew than by Enron.
