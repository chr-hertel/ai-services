When photographer Adam and Doctor Lawrence Gordon wake up to find they are trapped in a bathroom, they soon realize this is one of Jigsaw's traps.

The plot really gives you an exciting and thrilling movie. The acting was really good and I just loved this movie. It's one of those movies you could watch again and again without getting tired of it. Towards the end it makes more sense, in the beginning of the movie you're not quiet sure what the heck everyone's doing.

Out of ten I've give Saw a nine. I suggest you watch the movie unless you really can't gore and horror.
