From what I've seen so far the "Masters of Horror" series has been pretty disappointing, but this episode was so retarded that it set new lows. This is some of the worst writing/acting/directing/"horror" I have ever seen in my life. I keep watching this series expecting there to be something redeeming, but I think that this has single handedly made me give up on it entirely.

If you like horror, then you will hate this film.

If you like cinema in general, then you will hate this film.

If you like Peter Jackson films (or if you're just a frat boy who watches scary movies for the girl on girl action), then, by all means, watch and enjoy.
