I saw this film noir comedy at the inaugural Mendocino Film Festival in May 2006. Having no expectations about it, I was pleasantly surprised by an intriguing, well-written story interweaving the lives of two wannabe movie actors and a just released mental patient. It's an excellent vehicle for the young actors, with ample time devoted to character development and sub-plots. It's all part of the set up for the crucial scene when the three men are thrown together in the shooting of a scene for a very low budget independent film. I found it amusing, enjoyable and entertaining, and I admired it as a piece of film art. I recommend it.
