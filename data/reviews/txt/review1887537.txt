Enjoyed seeing a very young Sophia Loren, (Lady L) and a very handsome Paul Newman, (Armand Denis) both playing unbelievable comic roles. Lady L is a woman who takes in laundry to make a living and visits a bordello to collect dirty clothes and meets up with Armand who manages to fall in love with her and it is not too long before they have a baby. Lady L finds that Armand is more interested in making a bomb and and joining a secret spy ring that wants to kill a nobleman in high office. Lady L meets up with David Niven who owns a great deal of money and wants to marry her even though she is already married to Armand. As soon as Lady L obtains fancy jewelry, Armand wants to give it to the poor like a Robin Hood of his day. There are flashbacks as Lady L recalls her past to a man who wants to write her biography, however, it is so immoral, he decides to change his mind. A real crazy comedy, but enjoyable from 1965, enjoy.
