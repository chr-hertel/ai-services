After watching this film for the first time on DVD, I watched the "Additional Scenes", which quite frankly are nothing less than a different vision of many of the scenes of the film. The DVD starts out clunky, crude and a far cry from the TV show. However, as the film progresses, many of the Duke characteristics start to appear. I must note that the second half of the film is actually pretty good, due in part to the chemistry of the actors, the story, and the action. The first half suffers, again, from crude language, and many of the characters don't seem to have found their footing yet. In contrast, the "Additional Scenes" in the Special Features section reveal a much more familiar portrayal of nearly every character (Exception: Roscoe. Unfortunately, MC Gainey just was not a good fit for the part; too mean and not bumbly enough), and the crudeness factor is nearly erased completely. You get the feeling that there was creative differences in the editing room, which is unfortunate because the better first half of the film ended up in the wrong part of the DVD. I recommend watching the movie on DVD, then immediately going back and watching the Additional Scenes. Hopefully, someone will come out with a cut of the film that makes use of these scenes and puts the film back in line with the TV show. There is still a lot of potential with this film...
