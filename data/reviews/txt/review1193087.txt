I had a feeling that "The Breaks" would have some bad reviews on IMDb, but it is good to see that it had some very high ones too because it is not a bad movie. 

I think what turns people off is the opening sequence. The opening sequence in this movie is poorly acted and has some bad gags that could of turned out better if it was acted better. But don't have a negative attitude towards this movie forever after that. After the movie gets going it becomes funnier and the actors that did poorly in the beginning suddenly start doing well. And it is great for rest of the movie.

The jokes in this movie (bar the opening sequence) are very funny and sometimes very original. There are some good laugh out loud moments. 

Acting wise it is pretty good (once again, bar the opening sequence). Some good cameos throughout too.

Overall it is not the funniest movie ever but it is very entertaining. It may be enjoyed more if you are a fan of hip hop and/or hood movies but I'm pretty sure someone not familiar with that whole scene will still enjoy this movie. A funny, original comedy.
