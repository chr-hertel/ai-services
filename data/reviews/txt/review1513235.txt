I caught this show on one of the "kids'" channels in the late 90's, and was blown away by it. Yeah, I'm in my forties, but I liked the dynamic of it and the "family feel" of the characters--they all really genuinely seemed to care for one another. The actors did a superb job of making me believe these were real people. I teach college English, and I am around college students all the time, and I say bravo to this ultra realistic portrayal of college students of the future in space. Maybe if more American screen writers and producers(read money men and women--those who hold the money) saw shows like this, American sci-fi (skiffy) would be more mature, realistic, and overall better!

I definitely loved the crew of the ship ILEA--Anna Chancellor(her big break out was four weddings and a funeral) was INCREDIBLE as the young but wise navigator Mercedes Paige. She interacted well with both the characters of the crew and the students she "mentored"

all in all, dynamite cool show--buy it, watch it, you'll be hooked too!!!
