I remember this show from a while back, one of the shows that you cant forget. I loved it, the animation was fantastic, acting was good, story was well written.

My favorite character in the show was Cheetor, he was the funniest and always got out of trouble.

I recently watched a few episodes on DVD, brought back good memories from when i was little, watching it every Saterday morning, I wont forget this show, ever.

Im grateful that they came up with this show, i don'nt know what it would be like for me if it was not around
