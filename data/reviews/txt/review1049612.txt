Knowing several real-life wannabe actors, screenwriters, directors, and producers, none of whom are exactly 'A-List,' I thought this movie was an accurate portrayal of the twists and turns that the life of a project and one's personal life take while one, lacking connections, tries anything to come up with financing to get a potentially great movie off the ground.

Look at how long it took to get "Ray" funded and made -- 10 years! Similar stories abound. It takes a monumental effort to get anything made that's a little bit different. Guys who control the money don't like risk! With all its iterations depending on the focus of the potential underwriter -- think Money-Man -- with a colorful cast of stars, all playing well-written characters, I can't get enough of this movie. I own it and have watched it many times. A real laugh fest for those captivated by all things "Hollywood." The name IMHO ruined this movie's chances at the box office. It implies a certain salaciousness that is simply not there. It is a warm and sweet movie about guys trying to help their sweethearts achieve their dreams. Should have been titled, 'The Darkness and the Light,' which is the name of the screenplay they are trying to produce, or 'A Hollywood Story,' or something similarly innocuous. Worth seeing by all means!
