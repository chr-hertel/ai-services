This is a late entry in the film noir genre and maybe helped ruin this wonderful type of film. This was just too boring, too melodramatic for a good noir.

It starts off fine but cools off - no pun intended - shortly after "Vic Barron" (Mark Stevens) arrives in Alaska. We see the slow transformation of a hard-nose vengeful man into a decent guy. At least I liked the Alaskan scenery. Who doesn't?

Actually, the villain "Roxey Davis" (Skip Homeier) was somewhat cool with this strange blonde head of hair. The women, led by Martha Hyer, were decent to watch, too. However, an 83- minute film, especially with good villains and good scenery - shouldn't lag this much.
