Wasn't keen on seeing Meet Dave, especially after reading the bad reviews but it was a freebie and I was bored.

To save their planet, Lilliputian extraterrestrials land on Earth in a spaceship that's taken on a human form as a disguise. The ship is named Dave Ming Cheng, and has the likeness of its Captain (Eddie Murphy). The aliens experience what it's like to be human, and complications ensue when the ship takes a fancy to Gina Morrison, a beautiful Earthling (Elizabeth Banks) and her son, much to the chagrin of No. 3, the ship's Cultural Officer (Gabrielle Union).

The whole miniature deal was still too reminiscent of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, and they didn't exactly do anything new with it. The flick just coasts along, but there are a few laughs to be had if you can get through the cheese factor. As an alternative, you can just play 'Where Was He on Again?' (aka Spot the TV star).

Yes, Meet Dave relied on a gaggle of stars from the boob-tube to liven up the trite comedy with Ed Helms (The Office) as the scheming, uptight No. 2, the ship's 2nd-In-Command, Judah Friedlander (30 Rock) as the ship Engineer, Mike O'Malley (My Name is Earl; Yes, Dear) as the useless Officer Knox, and the hunky Marc Blucas (Riley in Buffy) as Gina's puppy-eyed neighbor Mark Rhodes. But it was Pat Kilbane (Mad TV, Seinfeld, Spin City) who plays No. 4, the ship's Security Officer, who elicited the most laughs with his uncannily crazy timing and physical comedy.
