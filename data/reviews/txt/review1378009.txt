Alright, we all know this was a cartoon and not a movie, but this was based on real history making birds that got awarded for being depended on when needed in the throngs of World War Two. At the end of this fine cartoon they acknowledged that not only the pigeons, but dogs and a cat had been awarded medals in helping win the war effort. Have there been any movies made in the past to tell these stories? I can't remember. If anyone could though it should be Disney, they seem to have the wonderful sensitivity to do stories like that. This is stuff that should always be brought up to the forefront to let future generations know the great ingenuity of past generations. What's wrong with that? Keep the past remembered! Honor those who deserved it. Make more movies, yes - even cartoons, like this. Bravo!
