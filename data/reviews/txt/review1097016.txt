I've been a big fan of Polish Actress Joanna Pacula since the early '90s (Black Ice, Under Investigation). Still sensual and stunning at 47, she plays a role similar to one she played in 1993 (Every Breath), that of a woman who plays a dangerous game with her husband. Also of note is the actor who plays the chief police investigator - he brings the energy level of the movie up whenever he shows up. A minus is Richard Grieco, who walks through his role like he's sedated. There is a twist at the end, which I enjoyed. The South African setting was also a nice change from the usual LA/NY setting. For Pacula fans, a step up from her recent movies!
