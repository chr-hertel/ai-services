"Tsotsi" was a drama through and through. This movie was one of the more serious movies I've ever seen, I mean there may have only been a couple of light-hearted moments and they certainly didn't last long. Even still, I was pleasantly surprised how well the movie was done. The writers and/or director relied heavily upon the acting skills of the actors to tell the story and to set the mood because very little dialogue was used. It was almost as if they had to pay for words and they were on a tight budget.

The movie was very telling about the life of this young man, Tsotsi, and the path he chose in the poverty stricken area of South Africa. During the movie you got glimpses of what made him the way he was and you got to see the series of events to effect a change in his behavior and his overall outlook on life. But as I watched the movie from beginning to end, I realized that a lot was left up to the viewer to infer. Because of the lack of dialogue, the viewer could draw his/her own conclusion as to what certain scenes meant and what certain individuals were feeling or thinking. Even the ending left it up to the viewer to suppose what may have happened to Tsotsi later on. That aspect has its pluses and its minuses. Still, it was a good film.
