I always enjoyed Hanna Barbera cartoons when I was young. They gave so many great cartoons. 

Along with SWAT Kats, this was another great show from them in 1990s. I didn't care for First Season with the exception of few good episodes with Ezekiel Rage in it (written by Glenn Leopold who later became Story editor/writer of second season). I love the second season. Most of Second Season crew of this show came from SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron. There are wonderful second season episodes like More than Zero, Ghost Quest, General Winter, and many others. My favorite episodes are Undersea Urgency, Village of the Doomed, Other Space, and The Dark Mountain. 

Glenn Leopold and Lance Falk are brilliant writers. They also wrote many episodes of SWAT Kats. 

One of the things I love about Jonny Quest Real Adventures Second Season is the limitations of the characters just like in SWAT Kats. Dr. Quest is an excellent scientist. But he doesn't have fighting skills and military experience of Race Bannon. Race Bannon doesn't have the scientific skills of Dr. Quest although he is an excellent fighter and has great deal of military experience. Jessie Bannon follows the footsteps of Dr. Quest in Science and has great deal of knowledge in Music. Hadji has great deal of philosophical knowledge. He also knows a lot about the field of technology especially with the computer and follows the footsteps of Dr. Quest in the field of technology. 

With Jonny Quest, he is a central character to the show due to the fact that he learns a little bit of everything from everybody around him. Although he can be impetuous, still his inquisitive mind and clever decisions often solve the problems. That is what I loved about the Second Season of Jonny Quest Real Adventures.
