This is an interesting movie. Putting aside the fact that it starts off with the stupidest and most pointless 5-10 minutes of opening sequence that I've witnessed in a long time, it's quite dark and even pretty creepy towards the end. The acting isn't that good, but it's passable at least, and nothing to complain about. The directing is quite good and dark, and the scenery is fitting and rather good. I like how this movie doesn't really try to sugar coat the characters, as they all feel pretty real, human. I found myself almost disliking them at first, but hell, humans have flaws, and this movie doesn't hide that fact. Very well done in that department.

The plot is meaty and dense, with a nice mystery element. It's hard to tell exactly who the killer is until the very end. However, the cops in this movie don't seem very competent, as they don't really do anything except accuse Addison and pester his son, not really making an effort to find any other suspects. Iffy. I can say that plot holes are the main issue here, and the ending was pretty lame. And it really bugged me how many times the perception of the killer changes. One minute, it's him---no, him---now him! And now it's her! Ridiculous. At least they put a lot of thought into it.

I'll recommend this to fans of detective thrillers, though. It's not nearly as bad as people make it out to be.
