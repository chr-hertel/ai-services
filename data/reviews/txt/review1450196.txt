Wow, with all the poor votes for "Wild Things", I just had to pop in and give it a big, fat 10! I loved this movie, and yes, I love it because it is HOT! There are certain movies, like Wild Things, Body Heat and others, that just revel in pure sexuality, not of just nubile young bodies, but the sexiness of mystery and deceit and suspense and conspiracy and swampy locales.

Anyone can find sexy actors and throw them up on screen and let them writhe around. But it takes special talent to truly make a movie "hot". It takes great writing skills to take romance novel dialog and make it presentable. It takes great acting to deliver such lines in believable, yet sexy, ways. It takes great directing to properly pace and shoot the action and ratchet up the suspense. It even takes great set direction and location spotting. It's not an easy thing to pull off, and these people pull it off superbly.

This is the "torrid love affair" at its sleaziest best. This is such a masterful take on this particular genre, in no way does it deserve less than a 9. I would consider it a "must watch" for anyone who's not a total prude.

10 out of 10.
