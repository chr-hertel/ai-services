i just saw this movie n really liked it. i really like movies that deal with the subject of time travel / mind disorders that leaves the end open for discussions..

i was wondering if there are other ppl who think the theme of this movie was quite like 12 monkeys & the butterfly effect. i.e. characters time traveling or their minds playing tricks on them! i'd also like to know if there are any other movies besides the ones I've mentioned that are like this..

I've not read other posts. so i dunno if this subjects been already discussed!
