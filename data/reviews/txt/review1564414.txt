But not as good as his early stuff. Still this one shows he still has a good movie or two in him.

Anyone following Steven Segal's career has seen a pretty painful drop in movie quality from him, this one is I hope, the beginning of a up swing.

The Story is his usual "have to save a loved one and kill all the bad guys in the process" CIA related thing. But the characters are, with the exception of his daughter pretty believable and fun to watch. Steven's fights are better in this then in his last few outings but still no where near his classic stuff. I watched this one sort of fondly during the fight scenes, thinking "well at least it is him this time not some padded up stunt double" It was a fun watch and left me hopeful that something good may still come out of Steven Segal. Worth watching for fans like me.
