This film is on par with the best of modern day movies such as Raging Bull,Being There, American Beauty,Tender Mercies, Lost in Translation,Heathers,Ghost World...... Some of my buddies rag on me calling it a "chick flick", but it is as good any movie of the past 25 years.I have to watch it every time it airs. I just missed half of a football game because I kept jumping back to Tomatoes! Great screenplay (and novel).And what a great cast!

Well I see that my comment was not long enough so I will say how doggone hot Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary Louise Parker are!!! have they ever been anything that wasn't good, and I mean I even liked Bad Girls, or whatever it was called, with Masterson. Well I have now typed enough lines, but now I want to talk about Masterson's great smile for ten more lines.
