The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! (1998, Dir. David Zucker) 

When Det. Nordberg (Simpson) is shot and placed into a coma, bumbling Lt. Frank Drebin (Nielsen) of Police Squad, make it his number one target of who is responsible. It leads him into the presence of rich Vincent Ludwig (Montalban) and a plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II (Charles).

Hilarious spoof which doesn't slow down from start to finish. This was released back when spoof movies actually had a story. Instead of random gags, the jokes are tired together with a well thought of storyline, which shows perfectly why Leslie Nielsen will forever be known as the king of spoof.

Frank, they're not here for you. "Weird Al" Yankovic is on the plane. Â– Captain Ed Hocken (George Kennedy)
