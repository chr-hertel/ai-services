"One Way Out" failed to separate itself from the crowd. There was nothing particularly brilliant or unique about this film. If it weren't for the names Belushi and Bateman I think this film would have zero credibility. There was a murder, the story went as it should, there was a twist, then there was justice. The acting wasn't much to rave about nor was the story itself. The movie kind of lulled along as you waited to see where the writer would try to show why his film made it to screen. There was never any intense drama, no strong relationships, and no believability. Every character seemed empty, and without any action or good dialogue, the movie just sputtered along until it ended. Because I didn't turn the movie off before it ended I didn't grade it a 4 or less.
