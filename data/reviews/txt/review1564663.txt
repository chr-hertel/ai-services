Almost three hours of a plot less enterprise. The whole thing reminded me of a very energetic student essay which wants to discuss a dozen wonderful different things and develops none of them. I wanted very much for this to be a great film. It features some truly fine actors. But they had no real purpose. Joe Pesci was completely useless - unless you find his highly forced question about Jews and Italians and Blacks to be something of a truly deep insight.

Perhaps, if you if you are of the Sesame Street generation and well conditioned to a series of unrelated but stimulating events, you will be in your element. If you have a bit more intellectual refinement and are one who reads Joyce or James or even Capote - stay away.
