I was one of the few who actually saw this films theatrical release in 1981! I was 18 and saw it at a Drive-In movie (of all obsolete places) !! Myself and about 10 of my friends loved it so much we quickly snagged a VHS copy and watched it religiously for several years. Why this film was not more successful i don't know and i find it so strange that nearly all it's actors never went on to work in any other films?. its sooooo funny and completely stupid at the same time! This parody on Teen horror films should become a cult classic. Gosh I'd love to see it a again. I'm now 41 and my sister and I still quote lines some 24 odd years later! "Great physical beauty can be a handicap too" - "Do you think I look good in Green?" - Did you hang up? No, I just said click" - "Nurse Krud and Miss Van Dyke....Whats in a name?.. E-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g".
