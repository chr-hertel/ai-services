Sapphire's mother won't move out of her daughter and husband George "Kingfish" Stevens' house unless she gets the $50 owed by her son-in-law. When he hears Andy mentioning trying to buy his girlfriend a fur coat for that amount since that's all he has, the Kingfish offers to take that money in exchange for Andy's going in the chinchilla business of making one from them. Then he gets Algonquin to get a couple of rabbits to pass off to Andy as chinchillas...This being the final episode of "Amos 'n' Andy", it's a shame the controversy over the character portrayals have carried to this day since compared to today's depiction of pimps and other street thugs, the characters here are less offensive in comparison. Anyway, this wasn't as funny as previous episodes I've just seen the day before but it's amusing enough. Nice final look at a show created on radio by writers/actors Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll nearly 23 years before.
