if you're going to see The Wedding Date, you probably have some idea of what the film is going to be like. it's not Shyamalan, right? of course the premise invites comparison to Pretty Woman, and sure, you may feel that you've met Messing's "insecure single woman" character a few hundred times before, perhaps on some popular sitcom. 

but thankfully, all the actors seem well-suited to their roles and the action progresses quite smoothly, aided by a good helping of hysterical lines from the saucy best friend and sauced-up mother. this is definitely a fun one to see with friends, especially if you're tired of this year's pretentious and often wildly depressing Oscar fare.
