Great job Director, crew and last but not least Vinay Pathak. Same crew who did magic in Bheja fry, but its totally different. All the actor in the movie have done brilliant job. I seriously feel the movie to be strong contender for National award for terribly good performance overall.

I'm amazed to see this master piece which has been made with sincerity to emotionally appeal to any human being. Vinay Pathak has been fabulous throughout the movie. I feel he deserves Hollywood along with great. This movie will catalyze the and motivate originality in Bollywood. This movies touches your heart from every corner and imbibes some thought in your mind.
