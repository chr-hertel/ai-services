Everything about this pandering film is sloppy, stupid, and ludicrous. Incredibly, no one even caught the fact that the word Northern in the opening title sequence is misspelled "Nohrthen". The story, which has very little to do with the facts of the actual case, has been dumbed down to a degree that is beyond idiotic. Suspension of disbelief? Ever been in a hockey rink during a game? Apparently, one person speaking loudly to another person can be heard clearly from one end of the rink to another, above the crowd noise, game noise, reverberating announcer and band music, etc. The behavior of the male characters was patterned after a herd of retarded mountain gorillas. There is nothing even remotely realistic about the premise, the story, the conclusion, or the acting. A complete waste of film stock, and a severe black eye and embarrassment to the art of the cinema.
