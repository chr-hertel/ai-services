Always makes me tear up when I watch this. Great shots, terrific music and the interviews and history of VNY have such detail. This movie always makes me feel at home. The different mix of aircraft alone makes me want to hop over the border to get look, and it totally explains the passion and drive most of us have to fly, or at least want to fly. I wish someone would tell this to the people around my local airport. THen they would understand why we fly and why some planes are loud. And how much money and jobs it brings to the area. I feel free as a bird when this is on TV.

PUT IT ON BLU-RAY!

Note: Just heard back from the company, no blu ray but they are developing a new movie www.aviationepic.com
