I remember the trailers for the first series of thriller in 1973 where a fish eye camera lens would shatter and a woman's mouth "lipstick and all" would open ejecting a piercing echo'y scream..

I remember the first series being screened on Friday's at 9.00pm moving to Saturday nights at the same time for the second series possibly due to the high viewing figures of the first..

Being nine years old at that time i skipped the first series due to total fear already instilled by the aforementioned trailers.The episode i remember most vividly is "One deadly owner".The white rolls Royce would cut out in the isolated countryside without warning or lighting,leaving the vulnerable lady in peril !.

I watched this episode in Feb 1974 when it was first aired..All i can say is that watching it as a child was a frightening experience.

I really don't remember anything as suspenseful or as scary as this being produced by the American networks at this time for comparison.At least nothing that came to the UK..

The entire thriller series is now available in a pal DVD boxed set containing all the episodes from 1973-1976 so i can't wait to watch them all and see which other episodes i remember..
