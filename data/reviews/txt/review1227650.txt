Van Helsing is the new super hero in the series of many who have made it to the big screen, who fights against the evil in the name of god. The title role played by Huge Jackman (x-men) is really fitting wile Kate Beckinsale (pearl harbor) also matches him in every step, fist and kick.

The story is pretty simple BAD vs GOOD. But, here the good and the bad both are admirable. The director Steven Sommers (the mummy & mummy returns) has done a excellent job of making all the evil characters as cousins to each other and the way the director has conceived and taken the fight sequence is actually SUPERB.

The phase of the movie is on the mercury rise from the frame it starts to the end. The special effects is also an important aspect of the film as you will find in the previous movies of Sommers.

Completely an action film which can be seen along with your family, well as a matter of fact all super heroes film can be seen along with your family isn't.
