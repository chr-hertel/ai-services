This movie caught my attention as I was flipping channels on TV. What I first noticed was that the characters and dialogue were realistic. I could imagine meeting these people - it wasn't contrived and it wasn't larger than life. I thought it was engaging and well done, and more challenging and honest than most stuff on TV. The actors really brought the characters to life and made their interactions believable. The pace was somewhat slow at times, but for me at least, the suspense was always there and it never felt dull. It's not the type of movie I'd like to re-watch over and over again, but it was a pleasant way to spend an evening.
