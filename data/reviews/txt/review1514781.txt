I first saw this movie in the cinemas in the late 1960's and was very much glued to the screen and thoroughly enjoyed it.

Based on the time that TE Lawrence spent in Arabia, the movie unusually begins with him getting on his motor bike and minutes later he has an accident is killed. Then comes the back flash and his time in Arabia during the desert conflict during the First World War.

Filmed almost entirely in Jordan, the movie has some brilliant piece of cinema photography which can only be enjoyed in the cinemas to see the full effect, brilliant acting by Peter O' Toole - it was his first movie, as well as by all the others including Omar Sheriff and Alec Guiness. The music score by Maurice Jarre is well supportive to the movie and especially where the Arabic style is concerned as is the script by Robert Bolt. And finally, what can be mentioned about the director, the late David Lean except he is excellent.

Conclusion: Nowadays we don't get to see such classic movies in a cinema. For the simple reason is that they don't make them anymore. Lawrence of Arabia is one movie that is worth to watch whether on a video or a DVD and if at all possible, make sure that you are sitting in front of a large screen,
