Here's director Greg Carlson's recipe for one of the funniest short films I've ever seen:

1) Take four twenty-somethings bored out of their pretty little skulls. 2) Add one old square dancing record. 3) Watch as they try to follow along. 4) "Now flip this thing over and we'll really do some square-dancing!"

But seriously, this is just a fantastic little movie. Filmed entirely in downtown Fargo, North Dakota, this is the best thing to come out of that city since Peggy Lee. Actors Rob Garland, Adam Hagen, Jodi Hedstrom and Sally Jacobson effortlessly capture the essence of the post-college doldrums. I only wish a soundtrack was available, so I could recreate the fun at home.
