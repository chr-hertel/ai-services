This is wonderful film that I just happened to come across while flipping channels on the TV -- and was immediately drawn in. I am now trying to find it on DVD but fear that it has not been released. I was captivated by the soulful images of the Goldens and other animals, the water and the overall feeling of peace and good will it seemed to convey. I was totally relaxed by the time the film ended and left wanting to see more, which is why I'm trying to learn whether it is available on DVD yet. I was not previously familiar with any of Bruce Weber's work but will now certainly be looking for more films and photos by him.
