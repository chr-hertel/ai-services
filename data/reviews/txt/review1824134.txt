Forgive the rather redundant pun. The end of the day what I should try and summarise quickly is that this comedy is actually funny. Considering that my view of romantic comedies is that they tend to play for the safe laughs and an expected happy ending. Knocked Up does not do that.

The premise itself is rather risqu√© when painted as a romantic comedy (which this film is over the gross out comedy more often associated American Pie or Apatow's other work The 40 Year Old Virgin) as essentially a slacker impregnates a beautiful, though equally clueless, woman.

Overlooked completely are the leads in this movie. While Rogen gets most of the laughs (and deservedly so) it is Heigl who gives the best performance. Her breakdown in the clinic is completely believable and brings a tear to even the most unemotional human being. Equal applause should go to Leslie Mann (Apatow's real life wife) who despite being essentially the nemesis of the piece gives just as important a performance as a woman trapped in a souring marriage. Paul Rudd is the only of the four leads who isn't given enough to really shine. Hilarious in Anchorman and Apatow's earlier piece here he feels like an add-on to the main cast.

Nevertheless the film is brilliantly written and superbly performed by everyone. The highlights are undoubtedly the beard jokes ('your face looks like Robin Williams' knuckles) and Harold Ramis' Alzheimers skit. All the while remember that the two leads are actually have a lot of the same neuroses and fears as anyone in a relationship and that is perhaps the film's strongest point that despite the aesthetic differences between the pair. Ben actually makes Alison happy after initial teething's and that perhaps is the strongest suit of the film that the pair are completely believable despite the inevitable smutty jokes. It is well observed and masterfully executed.

See this film!
