There's much awesome activity in producer Irwin Allen's disaster follow-up to "The Poseidon Adventure", and yet not a lot to take in. You could close your eyes through this one and still be able to follow the plot. A San Francisco skyscraper catches fire on its unveiling, and there's plenty of stock characters on hand more than willing to go up in flames. The picture is so empty of humanity that characters we barely get a chance to know are given big, fiery send-offs--and for what purpose? "Poseidon" worked because it had a handful of wonderful characters (over-the-top, perhaps, but nonetheless three-dimensional) whom we came to care about. "Inferno" doesn't have many interesting people in it: not architect Paul Newman, fireman Steve McQueen, Newman's girlfriend Faye Dunaway, honcho William Holden, con-man Fred Astaire, or even the Shelley Winters lookalike in the pink dress (Mrs. Irwin Allen). Astaire got an Oscar nomination for his work, but there's little evidence that he was around for much of the filming (it's an extended cameo, for prestige). The film was also Oscar-nominated for Best Picture, which might have been a gesture of good will since two competing movie studios (Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros.) jointly financed the endeavor and Hollywood loves a (profitable) happy ending. Oscar winner for Best Song, the distinctly unmemorable "We May Never Love Like This Again" by Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn; also for film editing and Fred J. Koenekamp and Joseph F. Biroc for their cinematography. **1/2 from ****
