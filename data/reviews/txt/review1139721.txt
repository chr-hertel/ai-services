Generally speaking, I appreciate the occasional horror flick, although I'm no great fan of the gory slasher genre in general. I am open minded though, and I never thought I'd see the day when I would call a film bad because it offended my morals. But that day did come: the day I saw "The Devil's Rejects." Not only does this film have major plot flaws (e.g., how the hell does the mutant-looking killer fit in with the story at all?), and has absolutely no scary moments at all, but it's entire premise is about as socially and ethically acceptable as a documentary expounding upon the delights of killing baby harp seals, or a song and dance number about the greatness of the Holocaust. The film literally advocates the torture and murder of other human beings. I can handle a movie where people are tortured and killed, don't get me wrong, for I have seen my fair share of Freddie/Halloween type movies, but never before have I run into a film that is obviously trying to tell the audience that the massive spilling of blood and screaming is a GOOD thing. I'm no televangelist, mind you, in fact I'm a Wiccan and a registered Libertarian, but this sort of thing just crosses the line. It's despicable.
