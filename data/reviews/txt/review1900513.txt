Wow... There are so many things you can do in your lifetime than watch this movie. Sure, it has Debbie Rochon. (For about 5 minutes...) And of course the production company cashes in on this BIG TIME. This is no more than a bunch of friends getting together making a home movie. One of them has a decent camera, (which it seems they never cleaned...) so they decided to make a movie after a night of drinking. If you've seen any interviews with them, they proudly declare that they came up with the title LONG before they came up with a concept for the movie, and it shows. The special effects really aren't really that special. The acting really isn't acting. In fact, it's almost insulting. Production value is laughable. Just how many producers are needed to make a low budget flick like this anyways? When you see one of the bikini clad girls is one of the producers, it makes you think... "Casting Couch" There is no way the "Suzy" character was actually hired to do this film. She's not good looking, she can't act, but she's in many scenes and she's a producer. She doesn't even get naked... She either invested a lot of money in the film or "worked" her way into this project in her own special way... A story would have been nice. At least a back story... Anything. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because you get to see some boobs and there are some laughable moments. Low budget film fans might find a few redeeming qualities, but it will be a stretch.
