...and yes I am including the likes of the Mighty Boosh, Little Britain, Shirley Ghostman! This reality? series follows 3 raver/eco-warriors (Su, Beetle, Frogger) as they fight against the government, pet shops, petrol stations, fast food stores etc. I think you have to be of a certain generation to get all the jokes etc but its actually a lot cleverer than it may first seem! I remember one of the episodes (I actually timed it on watching it for the umpteenth time) had more jokes and sly comments in the first 10 minutes than many other comedy TV shows have in their whole series! I really urge everyone to give this a go, there seems to be lots of people who have never heard of this (mind you the BBC didn't help with this as they tended to show it at 2.00 at night most of the time...) and who will really enjoy it! Smash up the government big style...
