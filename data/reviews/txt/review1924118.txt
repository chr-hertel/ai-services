i had high expectations for this series,and as soon as it arrived on DVD,i went out and bought a copy of it.even though i don't feel it was quite as good as i had hoped,it is still a pretty good series.it takes place sometime in the future in New Gotham.Batman does not make an appearance in this show,though he is alluded to a few times.this show is about the next generation of crime fighters who try to make the city safe.the three main characters are all women,and there is also a supporting character,played by a women.all the female characters are well defined and strongly written.at least i thought so.the series itself is pretty good,although i found a few of the episodes sort of mundane.i also thought some of the fight scenes looked a bit too stagey,and the there is some repetition in the show.i won't get int specifics on that point,but if you watch the show,you'll see what i mean.otherwise,i enjoyed it,and would recommend it to others.7/10
