Awkwardly staged short subject has SYLVIA SIDNEY pleading with her husband's boss to give him the promotion he so richly deserves--after a disastrous dinner which goes wrong in every possible way.

While this serves as a reminder of hard times during the Great Depression, it's hardly a memorable short subject. The dialog is as awkward as the staging with none of the actors at their best.

SYLVIA SIDNEY is passable as the distraught wife, a role she would go on to play in countless other films, but she can't save the short from being impossibly dull. LYNNE OVERMAN as her husband is convincing enough but the whole project was doomed from the start with a lifeless script.

Summing up: An early talkie is a depressing look at hard times.
