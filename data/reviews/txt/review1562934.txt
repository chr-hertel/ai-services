Comic books get a throwaway comedic nod in the Luke Wilson/Uma Thurman vehicle "My Super Ex-Girlfriend". Regular guy (Wilson) quickly hits it off with coy artist with a secret superhero identity (Thurman) only to drop her for his real love. It's a wild and zany movie that demands a deep bowl of popcorn, but unnecessarily takes most of the running time to really get to its point. The flick zones in on every comic book movie stereotype, and merges it with many of the romantic comedy conventions. Sometimes the results work seamlessly, but director Ivan Reitman seems uncomfortable with the action sequences which harm the overall cartoon-like comedy he was attempting.
