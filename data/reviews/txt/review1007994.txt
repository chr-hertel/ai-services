Others may not know "thought out script writing" when seen other critiques show this page, I have seen poorly written/directed, but this one gives a catalyst from the Cage lead character's youth, to why he's bothering to find an uncertain priceless treasure, Voight's father character long since dismissed as myth.

I highly commend the adventurous momentum and close attention to detail required of 18th century thinking clue solving, to keep pace with the "who gets there first" accent on finding a "world treasure" from ancient times collected the characters were involved, to the point of gambling "borrowing" the particular document needed from national archives to solve the enigma of message required for the find.

For the others who don't see this, that's alright. "Sneak Previews" show rarely sees the same or misses the whole point of a story too. Realistic? If anyone's ever pursued such attempt, like lottery winning, likely prefer a cover story to deter attention, think about it.
