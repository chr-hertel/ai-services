Hi to everyone!

Just finished watching the movie and by the end of it I felt a bit stunned. Why stunned? Because if you asked me to say some words about this movie I probably wouldn't know. This movie is one of the rare movies that really got me speechless...

but all I'm gonna say is that it takes a lot of imagination to combine music with such a moving story... wow. I enjoy watching music films but this is something out of the ordinary... it's... SPECIAL... :) 

I loved every song in this movie especially the one they sing in the church, I think it's called "Rise me up" or something like that. 

Anyway, just wanted to say I loved it very much and I recommend it to everyone!
