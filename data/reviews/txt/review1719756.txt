Well first of all i don't agree on some of the comments of this film!!! I thought it was really really good, and refreshing to see Nicole Kidman doing this sort of role rather than an Oscar film. I think if people give it a shot it would see a new generation of younger people knowing who Nicole Kidman is..... not that they shouldn't though she is a MEGASTAR. It was also good to go and see a film at the cinema that wasn't a sequel...threequal or fourqual. Well in my opinion go see it rent it but watch it, its good and at an hour and half long its not going to kill you now is it. Plus i am loving Nicole at the minute and want to see in more kick ass movies.
