It would be easy to say this is an excellent gay film. But to say that is to pigeon-hole a film that is excellent, full-stop. It's engaging to any audience. It's extremely well-crafted and stays with you long after you've seen it.

Erin Kelly is convincing as Annabelle, a self-assured seventeen year-old. Diane Gaidry's performance of Simone is real, vulnerable, powerful, complex. It is this film's complexity that confuses the moral questions of the student-teacher relationship. The situation is not so black and white.

Director/writer Katherine Brooks is a talent to watch.

Deeply moving and imaginative film. Funny, tragic. Exceptional direction, acting and script. Go see it now!!!
