'V For Vendetta' is a film set in the future where the world behaves strikingly similar to the film '1984' with a corrupt and controlling government and ruler placing bans on human freedoms. Among the chaos is a hero dressed symbolically as Guy Fawkes who wishes to bring down the government. In a chance of fate, he meets Evie, and her life changes while she is thrown into a series of events that pull her in his direction. The film is a masterpiece combining an engaging storyline, unique characters and character development, and detailed cinematography to capture the different moods and atmospheres of the oppressed society. This film also has a lot of symbolic meanings behind its concepts. In short, it is like a breath of fresh air that we've been waiting for in so long for a couple of years of disappointing films. Very well done.
