Beside the two "Bad News" movies this one is my all together favorite from "The Comic Strip". Rik Mayall, Adrian Edmonson, Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders, Nigel Planer, Peter Richardson, Robbie Coltrane and off course Alexei Sayle all play brilliantly in this TV-production. 

A British screen-writer (Sayle) sells his adaptation rights to the American movie industry, the script is about the miners strike in 1984. The Hollywood hypocrites want the miners to win the strike, and so they hire the writer to re-write the ending with Al-Pacino playing the main role as the union leader. Both the story, setting, humor but most of all the satirical message is so strong you want to see this film again and again. You really get to see the terrible side of Hollywood's industry in this piece of art, with Richardson playing Pacino!
