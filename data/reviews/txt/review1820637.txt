Not until I read these comments/thoughts did it conjure up my memories of this show. I stumbled across his last episode (with Dennis Miller) one night recently, too, while checking out old cassettes. Classy? Urbane? Irreverent in all the right moments? there's no one that can touch this guy! Craig Ferguson can somewhat emulate by having the most unknown or who'd-a-thunk to interview that guest, and do a credible job of being genuinely interested in them, but Tom had an edge that kept you so engaged, and to do that 'til 2a.m. is a rare gift! I can't believe I miss him as much as I do. I have absolutely no regrets of the many nights I 'wasted'(?) staying up way too late but oh-so-enjoying and savouring the seconds spent watching Tom Snyder. If his show was available on DVD it'd be something to treasure. He was truly unique.
