my sister and i just watched this movie yesterday,so i thought i would put in my two cents.she liked it more than i did.i didn't think it was very funny.in fact,i never laughed once.but i did think it was passable entertainment,for the most part.a few times i did get bored though.i just found it hard to believe that the people on one street in town would go to so much trouble to make one family celebrate Christmas.and for me,i didn't fee any chemistry between Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis,who played the husband and wife who decided to skip Christmas this year.Dan Akroyd played the neighbour who had the most influence in town,and tried to get the Cranks(Allen and Curtis)to celebrate the season.mostly i just found him annoying.M.Emmet Walsh was in the movie,and i liked his character.anyway,overall,i'd say this is a movie to catch on cable or as a cheap rental.interestingly,this movie is based on a John Grisham novel,called Skipping Christmas.i wouldn't rate it any higher than 4/10
