In the fifth entry in the Angel Guts films, Takashi Ishii, himself takes over the directorial reins to tell this story of Nami,a nurse who after getting almost raped by two patients and returning home only to find her photographer boyfriend cheating on her with another woman (eagle eyed viewers will recognize her as Nami from the forth film, "Red Porno"), has enough. Running into the street in a frenzied state, she gets hit by a car. While she's knocked out the helpful man molests her, putting the running tally to 3.. At first she's angry at him, but then they begin to fall in love. While this was better then the forth and worst of the series, it was still nowhere near the first three. Which makes me strongly feel that Angel Guts would have been a fondly remembered trilogy, if only they left it at that.

My Grade: C 

DVD Extras: Commentary by Jasper Sharp; Bio/Filmographies; a 32 and a half minute interview with Takashi Ishii; Original Sleeve art; and Trailers for this and 4 other Angel Guts Films (High School Co Ed, Red Classroom, Nami, & Red Porno) all available in Artsmagik's Box-set, but for some reason the 6th film "Angel Guts: Red Flash" is not in the set
