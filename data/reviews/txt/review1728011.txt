I've waited 3 long months just to watch this movie and from all the records it was breaking, day by day, my expectations were sky-rocketing. But when i watched the movie just a few days back, i was REALLY blown. I personally liked Aparichithudu a lot better than Sivaji because of better screenplay, story, and music. I expected Shankar to do better than Aparichithudu but he failed to do so. The sole plus of this film is RAJNI ALL THE WAY!!!!! Be it dances (give him a break, he is around 58) or fights, he performed really good. Especially scenes when he enacted NTR, ANR, and Chiranjeevi. Fights were OK (i liked the way they were shot on steadicam). Music by Rehman sucked BIG TIME! Cinematography was excellent. Like i said, Shankar disappointed big time with a weak screenplay but it is ONLY RAJNI who carries the film.
