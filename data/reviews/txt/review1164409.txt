That is really a very very good film. It approach the word "humanism" in a very kind way. We are first of all human beings, leaving in the same planet, breathing the same air, having the same needs, we should all show respect to each other no matter what sex,color and religious beliefs have the other people. Nell's character in the film is in my opinion the human being that most of us seek in our modern communities. I sorry if i tired you, but all that thoughts and feelings, that i have already mentioned, came from that wonderful film. Closing i would really like to congratulate all the cast of the film and especially Jodie Foster for her excellent performance in a very demanding role. I strongly recommend to see that movie, after all it's worthwhile!
