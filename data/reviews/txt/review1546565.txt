I read the books, and i thought they were incredible, especially considering the inexperience of the author. The movie falls to the other end of the spectrum. You need to know the books to even make sense of the movie - the person who accompanied me spent the entire car ride to her house asking me what happened. Not only that, but it is a forced movie - everything happens too quickly. The only good thing was the four good performances, done my John Malkovich, Jeremy Irons, Eragon (cant remember his name) and Rachel weisz. They had sound performances, even though the screen writer should be torn limb from limb. ANother thing is how utterly clich√© it was. They tried to make it a little heartfelt near the conclusion, but failed utterly. If you want to waste time and money, then go ahead and see this movie. If you want to be entertained, then watch the reactions of those walking out of the theater.
