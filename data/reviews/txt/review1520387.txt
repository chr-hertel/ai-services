Carol (Kate Beckinsale) is somewhat surprised to find herself pregnant. But, overall, she is happy. Her longtime boyfriend, Stephen (Matthew McConaghey) shows himself to be most unhappy, however, and wants her to get an abortion. That is because he has never told Carol the family secret. Stephen is the "normal" son of a mother and a father who happen to be dwarfs. His brother, Rolfe (Gary Oldman) is also a dwarf. Carol is stunned and frightened to learn that her baby has a chance of being a dwarf, too. When Carol is introduced, finally, to Stephen's family, her outlook brightens and she is ready to embrace her role as a mother, whatever the circumstances. What will Stephen do? This is a most thoughtful movie with a tender look at the subject of dwarfs. Most of us know little or nothing about their situation yet this film is very approachable and enlightening without being didactic. Beckinsale is wonderful as the woman who, although thrust into a difficult position, learns to look at life differently and more lovingly. The other actors are all very fine, especially the cast of dwarfs. The production values of the film are quite high, considering that, for example, Oldman is not a dwarf but must look like one. Most importantly, this is a film that is a stepping stone to a greater understanding between folks of different strokes, as they say. Anyone who wishes to bridge any gaps, be they racial, religious, ethnic, and so on, should arrange a showing among a diverse audience. Everyone will benefit, even as they are caught up in engaging and offbeat tale.
