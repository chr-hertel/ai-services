This slice of film noir isn't one of the better known ones, and the reason for that is probably because it doesn't have any real stand out elements about it; but the film does work excellently as a textbook example of the style of film-making. The most notable thing about the film is the fact that it features a leading performance from the great Humphrey Bogart. Bogart's personality has always been more than a little bit over the top, but it often isn't too noticeable. For some reason, however, it really sticks out in this film; but it somehow fits the dialogue like a glove, and the feel of this film is very much in the true classic style of noir. The plot is pretty standard, and follows Bogart's character; an ex-paratrooper, who is looking for a friend of his that disappeared after being accused of murder. However, he gets more than he bargained for when he hooks up with his friend's mistress, 'Dusty' Chandler. The atmosphere of the movie is dark and mysterious, and this blends brilliantly with the brooding plot line. The film manages to pull in many of the standard noir elements; best of which is the femme fatale; excellently brought to life by Lizabeth Scott. Overall, Dead Reckoning is a very good example of the film noir style of film-making, and while it's not one of the 'must see' films; it's certainly well worth bothering with.
