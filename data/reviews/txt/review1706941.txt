This is a short film that was included on the DVD for the full-length film THE REPUBLIC OF LOVE. Apparently DVDs from "The Film Movement Series" are a monthly independent film release and come with a short movie as well. Not bad for a DVD extra! This is a super-simple little film with a minimum of dialog. The film begins in what looks like a hospital or nursing home. A resident named "Henry" is wheelchair-bound and says nothing, but he spends most of the movie trying to slowly escape--even though each time, the tough nurse stops him and returns him to his room. In some ways it looked like a live version of a Warner Brothers cartoon, as the action seems pretty silly at first, but over time the real motivations become apparent and the film delivers a nice fitting conclusion.

Considering it's only about 10 minutes long, what can it hurt?! Give it a try.
