I'd heard lots of other people say that Charlie is "weird" in this version of the movie - people who think this just don't get it.... or haven't read the book. 

It is a classic Tim Burton movie and Depp is at his best. The make-up, the outfits, the warped humour..... it's all there. The build-up to the actual factory visit is excellent, we were all gripped and excited, like we could actually win a ticket ourselves!!! 

The only negative thing I have to say about this movie is that I thought the Oompa-Loompa singing sections went on a bit too long although they were brilliantly done (I don't know anyone who likes singing in a movie!). 

The effects are superb to delight the kids and the grown-ups will love the humour. See it..... I want to see it again I loved it that much!
