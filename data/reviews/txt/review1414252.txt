Nearly as funny as the first, but with numerous twists and turns (some foreseen, some unforeseen). Depp again masters the role of CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow! Still straddling the line between good guy and true pirate, Jack switches sides more often than Reba McEntire changes outfits in concert! Orlando Bloom revisits his role as the ever-gallant, quick-thinking, intelligent, (and need I mention --WAY HOT) Will Turner, a young man once again torn between his father's past and his own destiny -- where does piracy begin and can it really be avoided if it is already in your blood? And gorgeous Keira Knightley is back with fiest, finesse, and a fiery kiss (but for whom and to what purpose is it truly given???).

And as if those three characters couldn't deliver enough laughs and side-splitting comedy on their own, Pintel and Ragetti (played by Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook, respectively), are back in their roles as the play-well-with-other-pirates pirates, Ragetti intent on keeping his wooden eye intact and trying to live a "good" pirate life now that he is a mere mortal again ("It's the Bible -- it doesn't matter if you can read it or not. You get credit for trying!"). And that freakish monkey (who scares the bejeebies out of me every time he pops up on the screen is back, as well!

Anyone who loved the first one should enjoy this one AND be left waiting breathlessly for the NEXT one! (Other than "Why is the rum always gone," my favorite quote from this one has to be, "I feel sullied... and... unusual!")
