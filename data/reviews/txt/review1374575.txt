A cop fights police corruption after learning the martial arts and coming back from Vietnam.Also there seems to be a conspiracy among the politicians and therefore it's up to him to prove nobody is above the law. Steven Seagal made his debut with Above The Law and while it's a fairly well made action flick, I was often times bored with the standard story and overall assembly line villains put in the way of Seagal. That's not to say the movie isn't fun, it is. Above The Law is too routine though to grade higher than guilty pleasure. Although Seagal and Grier have good chemistry. However I enjoyed Seagal's next three movies a lot more.
