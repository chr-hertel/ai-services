Co-starring Rick Moranis and William Atheron, this motion picture is a brilliant mix of horror, fantasy and comedy all spiced up in one true crowd-pleaser of a movie. It has became one of the most successful, beloved and greatest movies ever made! it still holds up to this today and appeals to all ages. Director Ivan Reitman with producers and stars Ackroyd and Ramis has created one of the most original and funniest movies around! it has an H.P. Lovecraft-esquire feel to it and the film is loaded with great special effects that hold up to this day. The acting is also terrific as well including some of the funny moments, i loved this since i was 3 in 1985 when my mom got me the movie on video and i became a fan since. I ate the cereal, watched the cartoon, had the toys and even saw the sequel in theaters in 1989.

This movie gave us an unforgettable song which happens to be the title song by Ray Parker Jr. that is still popular even among Halloween parties. It's one of the most incredible and most memorable movies of all time that should be seen to believed.
