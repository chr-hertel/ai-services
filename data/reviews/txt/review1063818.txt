I really love this movie...but can I recommend it? Tough question...I have spoken to others about how much I love this movie, and then they have viewed it and asked me, "What the hell was so great about it?" All I can say is this is the kind of movie I love...it just has an overall feeling and flow that I enjoy. Also, it was filmed in Pittsburgh, and the exteriors of that steel town REALLY give this film a great look. Sometimes, you just don't want to see yet another movie filmed in Los Angeles! I would also say that if I were to recommend this to anyone, it would be to an artist, preferably a writer. There are great moments of the self-imposed torment that some writers put themselves through on a daily basis.

I really love this movie.
