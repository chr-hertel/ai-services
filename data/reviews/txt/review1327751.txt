Well what do you say, 'IT...WAS...OUTSTANDING!!' I Think Kevin Spacey was the perfect choice of movie star for the movie he has a great way of acting he has a certain calmness of performance, the film was 'Beauty' the title of the film was perfect and right the story it-self was extraordinary because it really projected the real good times and the beauty of life, because us as humans dwell on the bad times than the good times and that is what this film focused on we want more and everything in life but we don't realise just how good we have it. Kevin Spacey did a remarkable job so at one and relaxed Annette Bening WOWED! me it was definitely her best performance. It was a very compelling story and amazing a 5 star 'UNMISSABLE story which is almost not a story a part of life and fact which we experience it should be watch as it is defiantly one at the best films of the nineties one of the best of the last ten years it is so hard not to like it it is one of my favourite films a 5 Oscar 6 BAFTA Award winner REMARKABLE! by Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening 10/10 COMPELING TERRIFIC OUTSTANDING FILM
