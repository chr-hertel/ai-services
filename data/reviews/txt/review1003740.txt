I was a "Navy Brat" for 20 years of my life and spent a lot of time around the aircraft carrier. My father spent 31 years of his career launching and recovering aircraft. This movie, although does not depict the "true life" of a pilot nor the schooling, is very good because it is twisted to show a "hollywood / Rock-N-Roll" image of the Navy pilot. It is a good patriotic film without showing a defined enemy which means people around the world can enjoy the film no matter what country they are from. There is a lot of growing and dealing with life's problems which relates to everyone. Everyone should enjoy the music and the action without looking at it with a documentary frame of mind. This is just a movie to entertain and thought that they did an incredible job. I especially enjoyed watching the making of the movie and the cast interviews.
