Joey Cheng (Qi Shu) attempts to suicide using an overdose of sleeping pills, when her boyfriend breaks up with her. However, she is saved by the staff of the hotel and from this moment on, she has visions of dead people. When she finds that she is pregnant, she decides to have the baby and protect him against the frightening ghosts.

"Jian gui" is one of my favorite horror movies, and "Jian gui 2" has also a very scary story, with one of the strongest scenes I have ever seen. Although having the same title, this movie is not a sequel of "Jian gui". Unfortunately, the deceptive end is completely related to the Buddhist beliefs of reincarnation and too much straight for my taste. I was expecting for some last scary surprising scene, but I was completely disappointed with the correctness of the conclusion. The beauty of Qi Shu, an actress unknown for us Westerns, with her thick lips is amazing and a great attraction. My vote is six.

Title (Brazil): "Vis√µes" ("Visions")
