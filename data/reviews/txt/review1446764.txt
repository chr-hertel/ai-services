I haven't seen the original but this is just bad. The actors aren't bad, but it is the gory and bloody scenes that makes it bad. The ''monsters'' in this movie is just ridicules. You don't even get frighten by them. Every time i saw them i began laughing.

Wes Craven didn't direct this time, he left that job to Alexandre Aja. Instead he wrote and produced the movie.

You should never watch this movie because it is really bad. Horror movies like The sixth sense, Scream, The grudge and The amityville horror is much, much better.

It's not the worst horror ever made, but is still very bad.

I recommend this movie for those who loves bad movies.
