There was nothing worth noting in this film, and no reason to go out of your way to see it.

In order for a horror movie to work it needs at least one of the following: 1) Actual scares. 2) Gore/interesting deaths. 3) Characters you either fear for or identify with. 4) Interesting sets. 5) Tension as to what characters will live and what will die.

This film had none of the above. There were no scares. There was no gore. The characters had no depth and no personality. The set was a typical Japanese home with no character. You know immediately who will be left standing in the final moments, and therefore never feel tension when anyone is in trouble - you already know the outcome.

The movie begins with promise. The colors and angles will feel familiar if you saw the Ring, but it begins with promise, giving a mysterious death and a very creepy child. 

It doesn't last, though. You soon realize that the deaths happen off camera and are usually unexplained. You realize the main ghost is a very confused looking Japanese woman with a facial expression that is supposed to be terror but is so over the top it's pure humor. And you'll realize the characters have no purpose other than to die. None of them say anything interesting, none have any unique characteristics. You could take the lines from one mouth and put them in another without noticing.

*minor spoiler* The end is terrible, too. The ghost gets a character face to face, inches away, but saves the character instead of killing the character. Of course, this doesn't stop the ghost from stalking the character and giving the "surprise" in the end. Why didn't it just kill the character when it had the chance? *end spoiler*

A movie with a decent concept but terrible, dull, and mindless execution. There's nothing confusing, nothing mysterious, nothing disturbing, nothing scary, nothing intelligent, and mostly nothing interesting to be seen in this movie.
