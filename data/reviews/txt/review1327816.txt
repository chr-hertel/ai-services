This movie should have won all the Oscars in 1994 (Forrest Gump won) but we all believe The Shawshank Redemption deserved better. Tim Robbins played the meticulous character like no one could have. The story has a catch (the escape) but it's not about the escape. It's about hope. Morgan Freeman is a tremendous supporting actor, although I believe his role was no less important.

The movie's first part is confusing until you get to the middle of the movie. During the entire first half you sit wondering what's the point of all this. Yet you are glued because you hope there is something. By the time movie enters second part you feel 'man i should have been in that prison' There is no villain in the movie, everyone's just a character. It's no good boys winning over bad boys. But yet at the end of the movie you feel triumphant. 

Many people don't know about this movie because of the nature of the story. But then those who know, know too well. No wonder this movie is top rated at IMDb, that is a good enough compliment to the director, script and the actors. Oscar isn't the end of the world.
