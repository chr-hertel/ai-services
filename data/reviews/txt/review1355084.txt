Eric Schaffer is excellent and so funny. I look for really big things from him. Sarah Jessica Parker is a hoot and an early Scarlett Johanson is beautiful. I'm not a big romantic comedy fan. But I love this movie. I hope it goes down as a cult classic. Ben Stiller is also a hoot as only he can be. I recommend this movie to anyone of the age to watch it. It is a great viewing pleasure for all ages old enough to see an R rated movie. Although some may call it a quirky movie, and it is, it is worth all the quirkiness it holds. It is also an independent movie and I usually don't care for those either. Even my husband enjoys this movie. It is one we watch at least once a year. It is definitely on my top ten list of favorites.
