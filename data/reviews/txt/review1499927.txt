I loved this film! This seemingly short animated film packs a wonderful story into a beautifully hand-drawn four minutes. It is a story about a green "boy" who is thrilled to meet an ebullient young yellow "girl", who shows him the joy of living. Yet he's afraid to let her get close. Unfortunately, he is lured away by three blue "men" who are snobs and gossip about the girl, only to break her heart. The boy, who has joined them by this time, realizes his mistake and, giving them the raspberry, returns to the girl he never should have left in the first place.

The film examines everything from love,pressure to fit in, jealousy, enlightenment, and joy, and does this without a single word of dialog. Rather,Friedman uses an original score to mimic speech and support the story. Since the message is universal, this works beautifully. He even duplicated the movements of a live dancer to draw the girl's movements accurately (a la Disney). Somehow, you connect with these characters right away. This film maker is indeed a rare talent. He obviously loves this medium. He will no doubt be a giant in his field. I can't wait for his next piece.
