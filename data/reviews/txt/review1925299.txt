I am a big fan of Batman Begins, but when watching The Dark Knight I was amazed at how well crafted it is, how the character evolve, the themes and emotions portrayed in the movie and the amazing performances. This is truly a masterpiece and one of the best crime saga's ever made. A perfect 10.

When watching The Dark Knight you get introduced to a dark and violent world filled with all types of emotions. The story get faster as the movie proceeds and soon you are lost in the world of Gotham City. The dark tone of the film fits the new antagonist "The Joker" perfectly (who is portrayed in a marvelous performance by Heath Ledger)and as the story moves on you start to understand all the character and their inner darkness. I cant really say much without spoiling it but everything in this film is done to perfection- the story, the style, the acting, the music and the technical aspects. Also the film has numerous mixed emotions as the story progresses that truly make you think and analyze the events, and many moments in the film can only be described as epic.

This is a must watch for anyone who enjoys movies as i can assure you you will be pleased and will want to watch it again.

10/10
