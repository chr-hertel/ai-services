I just read somewhere that the Internet is full of philosophers and religions that have adopted this movie as their favorite parable. I'm not surprised, but that's not the reason I love it.

This movie starts with a premise that could be light, silly, trite, or promising but disappointing. Through deft writing and Murray's amazing comic timing, it manages to be none of those. The movie just keeps getting better the longer you watch it, and every silliness comes with a bit of serious thinking behind it.

Take home from this movie: A visceral awareness of what really matters in life, and how your own attitude in it is really everything there is. Not just mostly... entirely everything.

This movie threatens at first to go on forever, but after a while I wished it would. It compresses the lesson of "It's a Wonderful Life" into its first act, and then improves continually from there. I honestly can't think of how this movie could be improved.

To see how bad this movie *could* have been, watch "Multiplicity" with Michael Keaton. Then watch "Groundhog Day" again and enjoy. I've lost count of the number of times I've seen it.
