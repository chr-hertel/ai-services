This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and yet it has a certain Plan 9ish appeal to it. It has beautiful actors, nice scenery and decent special effects. Unfortunately it lacks two things absolutely vital to production values: T and A. All you get is a little cleavage. And yes, this movie commits one nearly unforgivable sin-the use and re-use of footage. Oh that irritates me! I wanted to trap a bunch of people in a locked room, give them potent psychedelics and watch their reactions to this movie. Half would try to tear their eyes out but the other half would be laughing hysterically. Mr. Evigan looks great for fifty five, eh? How does he keep those teeth so shiny?
