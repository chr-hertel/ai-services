what a terrible film.

didn't laugh the whole way through - wanted to see mrs henderson but my boyfriend dragged me to this rubbish cos he thought rowan atkinson might be funny as a vicar..

.he was a bit funny i suppose, he always is a bit funny but only because his face is so rubbery

unlike this script which must have been written by a ten year old on his lunch break from the remand centre

don't waste your time on this trash

you have been warned!!!
