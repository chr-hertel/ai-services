With a visual style somewhat reminiscent of Pan's Labyrinth, it's a pleasant surprise to find that Hugo is actually a story bursting with warmth and beautiful flourishes of whimsy.

A bit like Edward Scissorhands, Hugo somehow manages to create a glossy Gothic fantasy world and use it to tell some very simple and uplifting truths about how we as humans communicate with each other and the world around us.

Sianoa Smit-McPhee gives an incredibly textured performance as the frenetic and intense Desma and Andre Jewson is otherworldly in all the best senses of the word as the mysterious Mothboy who is about to challenge some of the beliefs Desma has constructed around herself.

The junction between haunting beauty and uplifting atmosphere is perfectly encapsulated in the film's score which is a thing to behold all of itself.

Bowen's script is beautifully handled by Verso and this audience member at least is looking forward to whatever is coming next for both of these people.
