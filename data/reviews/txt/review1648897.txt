Nominated for seven Academy Awards, and winner of Best Director, 'the Graduate' first and most importantly is a very funny film, with historic Career high performances from Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft, it's one of those films that is just simply brilliant. The performances were naturalistic, so ahead of there time, and the storytelling is so unpredictable and unorthodox. It's gushing with black humor so subtle you might miss it if you blink. 'The Graduate' is storytelling at its best, thanks to Mike Nichols perfect direction. It really is a hard film to put a lid on, it's a film that re-invents comedy genre to this day and in some ways has not been surpassed yet. Just go see it!!
