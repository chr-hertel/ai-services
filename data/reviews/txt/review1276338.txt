6/10. I felt the movie was much too hard to follow. You almost need to watch it twice...but I wouldn't recommend that because it's a bit of a bore. Burton's character is a disaffected, melancholy spie. That's a bit hard to watch for two hours. There's not much action to speak of so the dialogue needs to carry the movie and a moping spie just didn't do it in this case.

The movie is not all that suspenseful. The courtroom scene has some but it's at the end of the movie. I didn't care for the ending either. I don't mind movies ending on an unhappy not but I didn't think it was believable that Burton's character would basically commit suicide.
