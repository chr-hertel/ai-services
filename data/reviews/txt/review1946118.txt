There should be a zero rating here.....

This film was terrible. Do not watch it.

Basically two young men (Michael Pitt and Brandy Corbet) take a family (Roth, Watts and their son Gearhart)hostage in a remote lake holiday home. The start of the film is decent, but then cue 1 1/2 hours of the most infuriating series of events.

There were countless opportunities for the family to escape or at least try to but...of course no, they just did nothing....nothing......nothing

If you hate films where somebody runs upstairs instead of outside when being chased by a killer or doesn't pick up a weapon when they have the chance or screams for help out in the dark when the killer is around instead of running QUIETLY to get help .......you know where im going with this...

I don't care if someone tells me that the director or whatever clown was trying to get across some kind of underlying message or did all this to portray something, i really don't care and neither will anyone else, its still stupid.

I have never ever written anything on this site but i feel i need to warn others as i wish someone had warned me. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM.

I feel like iv lost something, not just time but something much more valuable and i don't think ill ever get it back as long as the people responsible for making this film are still alive.
