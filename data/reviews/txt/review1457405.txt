I can't believe I've found other people searching for this movie! I have been searching everywhere for years, and more so recently after losing my mum to cancer in March this year. I have a two year old son who will now never know his Granny, and it just brings it home even more. I originally watched the movie sat cuddled up with my mum when I was a little girl. Little did we both know that it would tragically have more meaning to us later in life.

I have just emailed "nannysue" and she has responded, so I'm hoping that finally my quest is nearing its end! Good luck to other people searching, and let's continue to campaign for this movie to be seen and appreciated by future generations.

Love, Mandy.
