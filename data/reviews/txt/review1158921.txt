In a circus, Violeta (Carla Camurati) is the wife of the knives shooter (Ney Latorraca), and they work together in a dangerous show. The shooter has two requests to Violet: she should never dress in red, and never get pregnant; otherwise he would be disturbed and loose his accuracy. Violeta gets pregnant and uses a red colored dress in the show.

"A Mulher do Atirador de Facas" was awarded in Gramado Festival in the following categories: Best Direction, Best Actress and Best Music Score. However, I did not like this short film. The story is very intriguing, but the open end gave me the feeling that the movie has not ended. My vote is six.

Title (Brazil): "A Mulher do Atirador de Facas" ("The Wife of the Knives Shooter")
