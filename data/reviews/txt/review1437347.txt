In this episode of Darkside we only have one character. One not particularly likable character. That's this episode's downfall. We have a woman that is haunted by an annoying ringer that won't shut up next apartment down. Of course she goes and asks around to find out why the person won't pick it up, and GASP! Nobody lives there, and GASP! the last person who did live there is now dead. The end is a bit stupid and the episode isn't anything special. You could see it coming from a mile away and the episode is too slow and ended up as a forgettable installment in my books.

My rating: Forgettable. 22 mins. TV PG
