A man comes home for his birthday party after work. However it seems he has been "infected" by vampire's and intends to "pass it" on to his family. A gang of black youths get involved and it all ends up with humans vs. vampires.

Interesting take on vampire's that shows it as a disease and one that works FAST. When people get a taste of tainted blood they immediately become vampires. These vampires have huge fangs, piercing eyes (neat makeup job), move FAST and tell plenty of bad jokes (we got "Nightmare on Elm Street" to thank for that). The movie is by no means great. It was direct to video and it shows. The film is very grainy with bad sound too. Also they throw in a lesbian couple for no reason other than to show gratuitous female nudity. (I'd LOVE to see a gay male couple in one of these films). The film does have a mix or black and white characters--but they're all stereotypes. The family is heavily dysfunctional and all the black guys and woman are in gangs, swear constantly and always travel with guns.

Still this film works. It IS scary and has tons of blood and gore (I can't see how this got by with an R rating). There's also a very eerie atmosphere with plenty of shock cuts to keep you off balance. The acting is OK--nobody is really good but nobody is really bad either. Basically they all do well in their roles. Interesting ending too.

This is no masterpiece of horror but I found it interesting and well-done (on its budget). I give it an 8.
