A subtle, ambiguous, multi-layered examination of American campus life in the 1980's. Narrated by three main protagonists, it follows them through the usual spiral of sex, drugs and parties, all the time each of them searching for a meaning in their confused lives. The most poignant aspect is that their search for purity, and for love, ultimately seems to be a fruitless one...

The observations of the regisor (man with a movie camera) are deep and mostly hiting the inner states and ironies of the protagonists... A movie that shouldn't be taken seriously for what you see, but for what you should see..
