This is a seriously bad movie that I've been unlucky enough to watch.

Cons: 

Bad characterization - both Aishwarya and Martin jump into their pride and prejudice polarities in no time at all - it's as if the director is expecting the audience to know the characters well already.

Terrible song-and-dance routines - I don't know if the attempt was to make it a musical, but the routines look terribly shoddy. They neither match Hollywood musical standards, neither are they good Bollywood-type interludes.

Poor Acting - Aishwarya overacts and Martin underacts.

Terrible view of India - The way Indian arranged marriage and family systems are shown, I'm really surprised how the Indian cast agreed to act in such a movie.
