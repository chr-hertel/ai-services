Having seen this movie more than 10 years ago, I can clearly recollect the movie, its cadence and its emotional weight. Critics in Holland called it baroque, I found it like an opera, it feels like 15 minutes, but in fact it's been 90. Profoundly emotional, it is one of the few movies worthy of depicting the confines of the Eastern European dictatorship, staying true to its human side. Rhythm is not dictated by imagery such as Wong KarWai, it is secondary to slowly unfolding plot, the wonderful photography and acting leading to an inevitable climax. Thematically universal and timeless. The director has been recognized and found his untimely praise for his more recent film.
