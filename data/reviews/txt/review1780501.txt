So, this film is legendary. Well..legendary to those that even know of it's existence, that is. Now, the awesome guys at Something Weird Video have compiled a near complete version of the film. This is the first film to be really inspired and released after Blood Feast.

The version on the Death Curse/ Sting Of Death DVD runs only 25 minutes, but as stated before, that is more than enough to know what you are getting into here. The full running time on this newer release is still short. It only clocks in just over an hour but for those hungry for more of the beautiful inanity that we were teased with, this will have to do.
