Excruciatingly long and expensive "epic" submarine drama directed by John Sturges. The Russians have a spy on a submarine. The submarine is on an important mission to the North Pole - nobody is sure who it might be the spy. Along for the ride to "Ice Station Zebra" are suspects: Ernest Borgnine with a Russian accent, Patrick McGoohan being Patrick McGoohan, and Jim Brown being Jim Brown.

Rock Hudson tries to keep a straight face as the mission commander. I found the movie and its characters so dull, I didn't care what happened to them. The movie's obvious expense might have been appealing in its day. The film has an intermission; and, I wondered, how many people returned for second half? The actors look more sweaty than cold during the film's icy end.

You can find more excitement in a single episode of the old "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea" TV series.
