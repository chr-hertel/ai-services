If you had actually watched past the first episode you would have seen that they eliminated everyone down to 18 contestants immediately.

But some folks apparently like to post an opinion before watching more than 1 episode.

I do agree that the reality show "Project Greenlight" was way more interesting to aspiring filmmakers because they could see a lot more of the behind the scenes stuff. And that's really dramatic all by itself.

I think On the Lot suffers from not enough "reality". Behind the scenes film-making is tough stuff, and I'd like to have seen more of that along with the finished shorts.

However, "On the Lot" is not a bad show. Garry Marshall is an oddball that throws in all kinds of jokes and then delivers a one line synopsis of why a particular film doesn't work. Sure he's goofy...but if you pay attention to those quick one line observations, you'll see why the man has made so many hits over the years.
