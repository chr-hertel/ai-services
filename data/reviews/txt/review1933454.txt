This film is included on the DVD "Shorts: Volume Four"--a collection of recent short films from a wide variety of directors.

DOG YEARS is in some ways a very clever film. The idea of a dog narrating a film is unusual to say the least. Plus, so much of what the dog gives us a different perspective on our pets, as the narration is very well written. However, as for the visuals, despite such great dialog, the film makers chose to use grainy Super 8mm film stock--just like you would have used for home movies in the 60s and 70s. To me, the disparity between the film and dialog was great and I just couldn't help but feel they didn't fit together well--sort of like dressing up a pig in an Armani suit. Still, despite the shabby look to the film, it is unusual and worth seeing.
