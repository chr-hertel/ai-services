What can be said about this masterpiece? This is the classic college high jinks comedy that launched a thousand inferior copy-cat movies throughout the 80's. John Belushi is brilliant. Not since Buster Keaton has an actor's facial expressions and body language received such big laughs without any dialog being spoken. Belushi gives a near silent pitch perfect performance as the slob "Bluto". This is John Landis at his directorial peak, he also directed the fine "Kentucky Fried Movie," "Blues Brothers", "Trading Places" and "An American Werewolf in London". But after that he really tanked, not since Peter Bogdanovich has a director created such a fine body of work, only to be followed by worthless crap. But I digress! National Lampoon's Animal House has an engaging story, characters and cast. Tim Matheson also gives his best performance as the confident frat leader "Otter" (the date with Fran Liebowitz is classic). Along with "Young Frankenstein", "Blazing Saddles" and "What's Up Doc", one of the greatest comedies of the 70's.
