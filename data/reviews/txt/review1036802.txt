The major directors in the Philippines, dabbling in the "bomba" films, from Bernal, Brocka to Tikoy Aguiluz always worked in hidden meanings, sharply hitting out at the corrupt political status quo. For example, in Tikoy's 1996 Segurista (Dead Sure), there's very little exposure of Michelle Aldana's silk-smooth flesh - what the viewers learn in the underlying message are the evils of poverty which drive the shrewd and pragmatic woman to flee from Pinatubo's volcanic havoc, leaving her husband and child behind, while she sleeps her way to an insurance agent's dream of success.
