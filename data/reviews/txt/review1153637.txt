After seeing all the great reviews here, I rented the film. I have to say, I wasn't very impressed. The story is rather dull with no twists or clever aspects. Being told in reverse order doesn't add anything to the film - in fact the movie, which is a pretty standard and pedestrian revenge flick, would have been improved by unfolding in chronological order. As for the camera work, which has been raved about - it comes across like a 1st year film student discovering all the effects with a newly purchased digital camera. The novelty of the swooping and trembling POV runs out of steam very quickly. Worth a rental, but does not live up to the hype.
