Possibily one of the greatest films ever made. Oliver stone bring excitement back into films with this innovative and creative ride through the adventure of Mickey and Mallory. The good thing about this film is also the mix of comedy moments, such as the opera music used when someone is killed by a knife. Mickey and Mallory make an excellent pair and Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis play the parts perfectly. The relentless killing spree they embark on is entertaining and extremely watchable. With the mix of surreal bits thrown in now and again to describe the possibly torment of the characters this creates a drug filled effect. My favourite scene being the scene in the drug store where the use of heavy green lucid lights create a luminous effect and makes the viewer a little dizzy. The prison break is a clever piece of filming. The use of hand-held cam puts the viewer into the action and showers the torture of the guards and the mayhem and chaos of the rioting. With also the use of a good soundtrack with the like of nine inch nails and rage against the machine put to good effect, it makes this film and awesome experience! Mickey and Mallory make killing fun! and turn it into a crime of passion and lust!
