Personally, I liked it.

Maybe I'm one of the few that liked it, but that's okay. I though that Glen Close did a wonderful job, even if she is considered to be 'miscast'. Remakes never have to be exactly the same as the original, I think that the changes in age of that couple was very good and balanced out the young and old couples. I thought that Bloody Mary was wonderful! She was hilarious! I believe that her voice was excellently fit to the character, a person like that would not have a perfectly trained singing voice in most cases. So, I'm glad that her voice sounded a bit wretched. Harry Connick, Jr. was superb. I was already a fan of his singing, but his voice in 'Younger than Springtime' has kept that song running through my head for a week now. Overall, it wasn't a perfect movie, but it was good and well worth to see again.
