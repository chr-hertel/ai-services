I've read all of Michael Crichton's books (even "A Case of Need" which he wrote under pseudonym in the late sixties) and was extremely disappointed to find his directorial effort on "Westworld" so mediocre. Although some of his other films have been quite good, Crichton is kind of at a loss here.

"Westworld" is like an early form of "Jurassic Park" - about a theme park out west where tourists can visit and find themselves immersed in the wild west. One of the cool features of the park is that it has robot cowboys who actually interact with the visitors.

However when one of the robots (played by Yul Brynner) goes haywire, all hell breaks loose.

As a film this isn't particularly well-filmed, well-acted or thrilling. I was quite bored and Crichton's directorial decisions made me raise a few eyebrows.

He's a great writer and can be a very good director, but I think he was still learning with this.
