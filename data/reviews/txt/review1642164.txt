SYNOPSIS: "Dr. Richard Thorndyke arrives as new administrator of the Psychoneurotic Institute for the Very, VERY Nervous to discover some suspicious goings-on. When he's framed for murder, Dr. Thorndyke must confront his own psychiatric condition, 'high anxiety,' in order to clear his name. An homage to the films of Alfred Hitchcock; contains many parodies of famous Hitchcock scenes from THE BIRDS, PSYCHO, and VERTIGO."

This is a Mel Brooks movie which also stars Mel Brooks, but Cloris Leachman steals the show! As Nurse Diesel, Cloris Leachman dominates every scene in which she appears, as the lusty Dominatrix who has made Harvey Corman her love slave. That is the sub-plot, and it cranks into high speed about half way through the movie and shows a side of Cloris Leachman we KNEW was beneath those three-layered skirts worn by the Frau Blucher (Young Frankenstein).

This is wonderfully entertaining, and is perhaps one of the most horribly under-appreciated, and underrated of Brooks's wonderful spoofs. It is one of Brook's best, in my opinion, but I love Hitchcock, as well. If you're not a fan of Hitchcock's exponential style, you probably will not appreciate this, either, which probably is the heaviest contributing factor to this movie's under achievement. That is a real shame, as this is a highly entertaining venture.

That having been said, this work is great, if you're a Hitchcock fan. Otherwise mere Brooks fans may not be able to experience full appreciation of all the wonderful gags.
