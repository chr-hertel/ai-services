One thing that frustrates me about a horror movie is the severity to which the victims are truly asking to be killed. In the first installment, the victim(s) seemed to be very illogical and confusingly hard to root for. It is as if director Salva was just inching the audience into the creeper's realm thanks to the incoherent mishaps and foul ideas the brother and sister characters put themselves in. In this second installment I was very impressed at the character development, this time we could watch people who had in my opinion "brains". Yes there are always a few characters that are unbearable to listen to but thats what movies are about in a sense. The creeper's presence was very "creepy" in the first with the big panel truck he was driving and the horn that he kept blaring. But this time he is in a whole new area and going after a whole new bunch of people. Some directors will use familiar references from previous installments in their sequels to get the viewer to understand the way he is trying to make the story flow together and I think Salva did a perfect job with that. 'It's towards the end of the Creepers twenty- three day shift and he's getting very impatient' is how I look at it. I give it a good 8 out of 10. Ray Wise's character is just superb.
