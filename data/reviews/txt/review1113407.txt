Before Hercules and Xena, the WB Network produced great made for TV movies. VANISHING SON, BANDIT (a spin-off of SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT) and THE MIDNIGHT RUN films. MIDNIGHT RUN FOR YOUR LIFE was fantastic. Christopher McDonald as the Robert DeNiro tough-guy bounty hunter with a heart was charming, funny, very entertaining. The beautiful Melora Walters (prior to BOOGIE NIGHTS and MAGNOLIA) is sweet as the lovable Lorna. I loved this movie, and luckily was smart enough to video tape it in 1994. I recently dug it out and enjoyed it again. It is a shame they don't make great movies like this for TV anymore, but it's great to see Christopher McDonald and Melora Walters still going strong.
