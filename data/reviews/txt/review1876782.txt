This is a comedy about four guys that are about to set a record for having played D&D every day for the past 23 years. If you can deal with that, then there's a good chance you're going to like this movie.

From reading the comments on here, it seems like this is certainly a "love it or hate it" kind of movie, but all of my friends love it. I certainly loved it. I loved it for the dumb comedy that it was. The mocumentary style worked quite well for this film. Although it was quite different from a Christopher Guest film (eg Best in Show), it has much of the same appeal--bizarre characters with an almost unnatural obsession. In this case the obsession is the RPG DND (Demons Nymphs and Dragons).

If you've ever seen other mockumentaries, you'll know that they're not for everyone, and you have to be in the right mood to watch it. But have a couple friends over, drink a few beers, and you'll be rolling on the floor with laughter.

I've seen complaints about the stereotyped main characters and the clich√©s that are employed in the movie. I believe that criticism stems from each character living with his parents and working at a lousy, under-paying job. Thats where the stereotypes end. Each character brought something original to the table, giving it a fresh spin. While a few of the characters are The supporting cast (Reece's Boss, Gordon's Parents, etc...) also really came through with a lot of laughs, rounding out the movie.

This movie is perhaps a little less polished and refined than a Guest film, but for a first-time writer/director/producer/editor its absolutely brilliant!
