Having missed this in its original airing and then seeing one of the later episodes I went and purchased the first season. This was a mistake. The historical errors mentioned in other comments here pale in comparison to the casting of a spoiled egotistical twerp as Henry.

The comparison to earlier Henrys, Charlton Heston, Richard Burton, Robert Shaw, Charles Laughton, Rex Harrison and others almost brings tears to my eyes. Mr Hirst your name will now serve as a warning to future viewers. Congratulations to the rest of the cast for doing so well in the face of Mr. Myers and poor writers. What a waste of talent. Tis a pity that a medium such as Showtime with its artistic freedom approved the showing of one of history's great rakes as a "little man" in all meanings of the term.
