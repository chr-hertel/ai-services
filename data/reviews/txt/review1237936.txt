I saw this in my History of the Middle East class and I was blown away with how well made this movie was. Sure, the sound and the visuals aren't ground breaking, but it gets the job done. While this is a darker movie (like many Middle Eastern movies are), there are occasional funny parts stuck in there (epecially with Leila's uncle). Some of the subtitles are funny too, not on purpose, but they flutter around and sometimes spell a simple word wrong, but that's not the point. 

I own this DVD, and it's certainly worth renting and watching. It's a chick flick with out all the sappy stuff.
