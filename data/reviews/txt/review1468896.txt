HOLLYWOODLAND is not your usual noir thriller. It has noir elements and it has thriller elements too, but it is a far more intelligent and cerebral film than your average film of this type. The film is about lost dreams and how our hopes and aspirations are sometimes crushed and sometimes taken in different directions. More importantly, it is about how we as human beings, deal with disappointment and our dreams not coming true.

The film asks the question - did 1950's Superman George Reeves commit suicide as a result of dashed hopes and disappointment over his career, or was he murdered. There are certainly enough suspects. The scorned and jaded older mistress (Diane Lane), her protective husband (Bob Hoskins), the new love (Robin Tunney), or someone else.

The case is seen through the eyes of Adrien Brody as a gumshoe who has his own demons and issues. Ben Affleck plays Reeves.

The film is beautifully shot and wonderfully told. The acting really, really is Oscar caliber. Ben Affleck is very good indeed and this performance should wipe away any thoughts that he can't act. He is wonderful. Even better though is Diane Lane as his mistress. It's one of the best actress performances of the year and should get her an Oscar nod. Everyone else is wonderful too, although Brody has been better than this.

Overall a wonderfully shot and wonderfully acted film that I can't recommend enough. A+
