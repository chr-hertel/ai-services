I think the play was excellent considering it's a real life situation. As a Christian, too many of life's situations are either sugar coated or swept up under a rug. How can you address issues or get solutions to your problems if you're constantly dressing it up. I personally want to commend Tyler Perry on a job well done!!! I believe that he is truly being used of God in this end time to get the message of forgiveness across to the world. I think it's critically important, especially to African Americans that we truly understand and receive a spirit of forgiveness. We hold on to far too much baggage. Tyler Perry is doing what most Pastors and Clergy Leaders are trying to do.
