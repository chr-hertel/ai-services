Thank-you, Ms. Hardwicke and Mr. Rich, for a stunning film of integrity, in every aspect. I was pleasantly surprised by your extremely satisfying rendition. Seldom do we see such accuracy and sincerity and truthful acting in a biblical movie from Hollywood. Not one cheezy moment. Respectful to the spirit of the text in its entirety. Sweet and humble performances by all actors. How glorious it is to KNOW that this is a TRUE STORY; not a fable, not a myth, not an allegory. I wonder if you, the filmmakers, really believe what you were portraying? Whether or not you do, I commend you on a wonderful, heartfelt, and reverent accomplishment. Many blessings to you in the new year!
