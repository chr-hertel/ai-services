Immigrants from everywhere can relate to this story of Korean immigrants who have moved to Argentina and find life challenging.

But what's most interesting about this film is that the topic and treatment transcend country, race and time. The director pulls together a topic and blows open the door through imagination, music and a dramatic plot that opens our minds to a rather ugly side of harsh life. The director has done a great job in getting in depicting some of the anguished and challenging thoughts of his main characters.

The screenplay was strong. From the start, you get a feel for life in Argentina which quickly moves to some interesting plot points that propels the story forward. Music sequences suffuse the film, which in my view, were overly long, but these help to give the film some spunk, and tie the film together with both content and style.

Overall, a very good piece from a first-time writer, director and producer. Congratulations!
