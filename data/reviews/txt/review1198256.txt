The only reason to watch the god-awful "Wild Wild West" is to see Kevin Kline as a neat foil to Will Smith. Otherwise, the whole movie's a mess. The "plot" has agents Jim West (Smith) and Artemus Gordon (Kline) trying to stop nefarious Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh) from dismantling the United States.

Yes, this does sound like a potentially great idea, especially given the cast (which also includes Salma Hayek and M. Emmet Walsh). Unfortunately, the whole movie makes you feel like you just got your head banged against a brick wall. There are a few good scenes, but only a few; the rest of the movie is just a rehash of better movies. Relying way too much on special effects, this movie makes one feel great that 1999 remains best known for movies like "The Blair Witch Project" and "American Beauty".
