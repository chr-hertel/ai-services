I managed to catch this film at the recent Slamdance Film Festival. I was there for Sundance, but I always check out a couple of Slammers and I was drawn to see this one because it starred 2 of the girls from The Descent. First off this is NOT a horror film, and one of the Decsenters is only in half the movie (that doesn't give anything away)... but thats where my disappointment ended. This was quite simply an awesome film. It should have been at Sundance, don't know why it wasn't. It starts out as a real dark thriller and then just gets darker and darker, drip feeding a real twist of a story that keeps you guessing right till the very last scene. This might upset a few people who like their stories straight, but I love them twisted and this was pure cork screw. The cast is fantastic all round, Alex Reid being a stand-out. The script is pretty spot on and the photography is unbelievable. It's one of the best looking films I've seen in ages and they supposedly made if for a few bucks! The story is very clever and really draws you. It's setting in the world of spying has been done a lot, but this is a really different take on the subject matter. Haven't seen anything by this director (Simon Welsford) before, but I look forward to seeing whatever he does next.
