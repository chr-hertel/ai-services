This is one of the finest gay films I have seen. Lee Rumohr plays Troy, a painfully in-love young man dealing with rejection from the only person he has ever really loved. The scenes of Rumohr and his silent suffering are brilliant - Rumohr shows us more through his actions and body language than through his dialogue (although this is also well done). The result is a powerful, raw expression of sadness from a young love repeatedly unfulfilled. The dark lighting and minimal changes in setting (most of the action takes place in fairly bland, undecorated apartments) add much to the story by creating an environment that makes the viewer see how Troy feels trapped in his small Canadian town. The seeming mismatch of Troy and Merrick only fuels the fire of this film by adding a key element of realism to Troy's love - blind helplessness. I was very impressed with "Denied" and think that the simplicity of the camera work and settings bring the plot to the forefront, something which many gay movies seem to forget in the wake of the inevitable "sexy dance scene at the giant gay club." None of that here, folks. Just love and pain. Well done!
