Having listened to the radio program every single morning in the 40s, it was a trip back in time for me! As soon as I heard Tom's voice I knew who it was. My mother took all three of us children to the live broadcast on several occasions. And Mother wore her hats, always wore a hat and gloves back then. I think you'd need to be of the proper era to appreciate it, and a lot of the other old time movies, as well. The war years were a time unto themselves, and I don't know how this generation could relate well enough to appreciate the nation's, and the world's, philosophies and attitudes of that time.

This movie is a warm fuzzy for us older folks.
