This movie really is one of the greatest. One which i can play over and over and never get sick of it. Its up there with Grease, Ghost, dirty dancing, days of thunder and the rest. It never really got all the accolades it deserves. Made back before Tom Cruise had a major ego problem. And Elisabeth Shue, what can I say...she deserves to have the ego that Tom has now. she was a star in this role. Although Tom is great, I think its going to his head. Cocktail...one of the greatest. I recommend you all go and buy a copy now. A great addition to the movie collection. The luck is gone, the brain is shot...but the liquor we still got. Cheers to cocktail!
