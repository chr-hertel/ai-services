Chuck is the latest in a distinguished line of TV shows, plays, and films that explore an American archtype - the reactions of a normal, decent person when thrust in extraordinary circumstances. Zach Levi has a real Jimmy Stewart quality in this funny and well layered show, which is as much about Chuck's effect on jaded superspy professionals as it is about his slow awakening to his own potential. The they want to but can't love story between Chuck and his protector, the luminous Sarah Walker, is both sweet and heartbreaking (think Pam and Jim of "The Office", but with no real shot at happily ever after. Adam Baldwin is a hidden gem, striking exactly the right note of grumpy babysitter gradually won over by Chuck's essential decency and kindness.

Highly recommended.
