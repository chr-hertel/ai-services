I think his previous show was better, but this one was great, too. He has a strange way of looking at life, yet can bring it to a very REAL point at the end that makes you go, "Yeah!" But you have to follow each routine to the end to get the points he astutely makes. He draws a portrait of what he wants you to see very well, so each detail is very important for you to follow. I've probably watched the previous show a couple of hundred times and I seem to pick up on a different point every viewing. It has become one of my favorite party DVDs. Everyone loves it! And I'll be buying this DVD just like I did the first one. In this show, one routine seemed a little sick as it began. But by the end of it, I said out loud "Yeah, that's right!" Maybe you just have to have a taste for his brand of comedy.
