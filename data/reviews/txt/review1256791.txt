Lot's of eye candy here. Beautifully composed shots. I always like it when an artistic director can avoid catching high key fever and not slap together a nauseatingly distracting palette.

Anyway. The reveals were so well set up and delivered, I got multiple laughs along the way at least a few times. I remember thinking the writer must have remembered reading Aristotle's Poetics in weaving the story together.

The actor's delivered! It could be a 10, but I got so caught up in the opening camera movement it spun my mind to wa-ondering well into the kitchen. It felt like a nice mini narrative, but like I said, my mind skidded off elsewhere. So, I was not prepared for Sarah's character's Mulroney's reveal. She played that character with such richness. I never saw "Sex in the City", nor am I inclined to, but that body of work must have come in handy in fashioning the performance. I am not saying that the other actor's did not deliver rich performances (I cried at both ends of the spectrum.), but she took me for a wild mouse amusement parkeride! 

I have to say that Luke's character's dream was, if not a transcript of a real one, carefully and intelligently constructed with more than a little understanding of Freudian psychology.

This is one jam packed film. It's tight. Tom Bazooka! You da man.

PS I saw 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" the other day and, there's one scene with Kate and Spence duking (dooking?) it out to a classical music score that Spence reveals is playing on the family stereo when it suddenly stops as he removes the record. I mention this only in wondering if this movie might did not have some opportunities for that kind of nuance.
