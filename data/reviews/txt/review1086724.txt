Dennis Potter's stage play was filmed for the BBC in 1969 and its release shocked many. Instead of the detached Christ of earlier (and later) Jesus films, and the bland overly smiley Jesus of later films, Colin Blakely plays Jesus as a passionate, down to earth preacher. Potter's everyday English was groundbreaking then, but still seems much more realistic than more recent attempts to do likewise. It gives Blakely something to work with in making this Jesus come alive, whilst retaining a dangerous edge that is almost universally absent in Jesus films. (The one exception would be Last Temptation of Christ, but there the "danger" is more from mental instability than radical adherence to his beliefs).

There's fine work elsewhere as well. Brian Blessed is a great choice as Peter, and Edward Hardwicke (as Judas), and Robert Hardy (as Pilate) are also excellent, but this belongs to Blakely, who's Sermon on the Mount is as powerful the tenth time as it was the first.
