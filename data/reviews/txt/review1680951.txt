Ray Walston used his considerable acting talent & charm to create a hit series. First show, he crashes on earth. His rescue is engineered by Tim (Bill Bixby), a nosy reporter who can't believe what he has seen, & what Martin can do.

This is a family style of sitcom without kids. This show is really the talent of Ray Walston playing off everyone. Bixby is brilliant to as the single reporter who is always getting in trouble thanks to Martin. Many times because of Martin, Tim can't get that Pullitser prize he is after to become a great reporter.

What really makes this series go, is that Uncle Martin always seems to have an unending bag of tricks that only he, a Martian, can do. When we were kids, we got introduced to a friendly alien with this show. Martin would always foil Tim every having a steady girl friend too.

While the special effects seem crude now, when this show ran they were highly imaginative. There was even one episode where Martin put up his antenna & had snowy reception, just like my TV always did with the rabbit ears.
