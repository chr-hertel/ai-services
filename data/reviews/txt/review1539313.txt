The "Dexter" series is awful, wonderful, deliciously disturbing. The basic premise is so bizarre as to ensure emotional ambivalence in every viewer.

The unfolding of episodes... eagerly awaited in this corner.... has taken a rather bland direction over episodes 6-9. But episode ten seemed to capture the magic again. I notice that the main writing credit goes to Kevin Maynard. 

May Mr. Maynard have many more opportunities to keep a good show good. It seems his efforts raised the bar. I hope those in important places regarding the show production take notice.
