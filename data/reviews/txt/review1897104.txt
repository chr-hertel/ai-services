One of the best things of this movie is that, like the original comics, it was made specifically for the younger audiences. It follows some of the classic comic magazine stories, mostly unknown to the new generation, as they were printed a while back, and gives it life for everyone to enjoy. To the little ones, it's a funny wild romp into new stories with the beloved Monica's gang - to the older audiences it's a fun new look at the stories many of us remember coming out originally in the form of a comic.

When I heard a new movie was being made for the Gang, I was excited but a little wary; after all, a full length feature for the comic had never been done with live actors mixed in before... what if that ruined the movie? As it turns out, the additions of the live actors were very sensibly put and well done and I found them rather enjoyable...
