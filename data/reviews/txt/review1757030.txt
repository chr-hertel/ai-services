Ladies and gentleman...Kris Kringle is alive and well and sitting on his magical throne at Macy's Department Store, New York City. I know this because I've watched this perennial holiday classic countless times. It never fails to hook me into Valentine Davies' short story. From his perch, seven stories up, Santa is on the precipice of sanity. Some people consider him a touch crazy. Who else would list his "next of kin" (on his employment application) as eight reindeer from The North Pole? Is he nuts? No. Well, maybe a little: "like some of those men in Washington." Natalie Wood, a tiny power plant of a child, doesn't think so. She is mesmerized by the charming old man with a snowy white beard. But she's not totally convinced. Yet. Her mother, you see, has hammered away any thoughts of make believe. No fairy Tales. No giants--except in the Macy's Parade. And fantasy resides in a place better left unvisited. A child (I think) needs a little world of their own, a place where parents are banished, and where a fantasy world is cracked open like a colorful Easter egg. I enjoy John Payne's kid-friendly, but ambitious lawyer. He butts heads with Maureen O'Hara, Wood's overprotective mom, on several occasions. Natalie Wood's performance is nothing short of brilliant. Timeless. And so is this wonderful movie. If you think I've short changed the plot and some of the plethora of memorable moments in the film--forgive me. You will find them on the DVD, nestled in your Christmas stocking. Kris told me so.
