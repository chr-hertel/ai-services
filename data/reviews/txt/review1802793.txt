Didn't care about any of the characters (I was glad to see them die off), found the contrived shaky Blair Witch camera style absolutely annoying--and there's no story whatsoever. Plot holes everywhere and no attempts at even the most simple explanations. If you like shameless product placement, low-resolution special effects, and the prose of a 6th-grader, you might not want to off yourself in the theater. The whole thing is shot to look like an amateur video (the film's only real success), so 50% of the movie is shots of walls, floors, and blur. Tries to rip off Godzilla and Alien with nothing new. Terrible! Rent Gwoemul (2006) instead.
