As I viewed this now sixty two year old film (which happened to be telecast on New Year's Day 2009) I was struck by its contemporary relevancy. This film happened to be about social prejudice directed toward Jewish people in the late forties. However, I made some substitutions, with starling results.

Instead of "jews" I first replaced it with the word "blacks," then "gays." While bigotry and discrimination against the African Americans has significantly lessened, it's the homosexuals who are today's target.

The subtle reasons for discrimination covered so well in this film's script are alive and well in 2009. Many people now use the "moral" rationale as opposed to "civic." Still, the results amount to the same: denying American citizens of their human rights because they are gay, lesbian, bisexual and also--in the case of aspects of the current Boy Scouts of America's charter--atheistic and agnostic.

The reasons June Havoc's Jewish secretary stated for supporting her company's anti-Jewish hiring policy ("We can't allow the wrong ones get in here, you know") are parallel to today's rationales ("They might destroy the institution of marriage" or "They might molest our children or warp their minds").

Today, however, the "gentlemen's agreement" regarding "gay rights" has fortunately passed the hidden stage, and has been brought into the public forum, which requires voting for or against "rights" issues. Thanks to this superbly directed (by Elia Kazan) and acted (by Gregory Peck, Dorothy McGuire, John Garfield, Anne Revere, et al.) film, humanity has progressed toward the day when equality and freedom indeed means all people.

We are grateful for 1947's "Gentlemen's Agreement" for helping pave the way for social progress in America. Here's a case in which the "entertainment industry" (much thanks to Darryl F. Zanuck) made a significant contribution toward social change. I do trust that by next year this time (and years to follow) my comments here will be dated and no longer relevant.

11/29/2014 Addendum: Today, 5 years after writing the above, I reviewed this film, and it held me mesmerized. What a lean, honest and well-focused cinematic artwork. It is standing the test of time well, and my previous reflections still hold up. Thanks to Laura Z. Hobson's brilliant novel, Moss Hart's fine screenplay and Darryl F. Zanuck's administrative tenacity, Elia Kazan and company produced a superior creation.
