Anyone who has ever fancied themselves as fans of character development, plot twists, mystery, intrigue, and drama will find that this show delivers all of these elements in spades.

Never have I seen a television program with so many outstanding elements as this series. While other shows approach perfection, LOST has attained it.

Whether it be the outstanding acting from the main cast, most notably Terry O'Quinn, Matthew Fox, Naveen Andrews, Evangeline Lilly, and (in later seasons) Adewale Akinnouye-Agbaje and Michael Emerson, or a fascinating soundtrack scored by television and film theme maestro Michael Giacchino, LOST delivers.

A show which is driven by its diverse cast of characters (it focuses on a single person's story each week), LOST offers well-scripted and well-acted drama with uncompromising quality and flare.

It is rare for a show to maintain its strength over two consecutive seasons, let alone four. LOST has done this. LOST will likely continue to do this for the remaining two seasons. And I can't help but watch.
