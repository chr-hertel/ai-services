I watched this last night in a little country cinema run by volunteers. It was a very worn print with what sounded like an optical soundtrack - lots of crackles. That added to the delight of this film. If you are 50+ you'll be taken back to your own school days, and the clever thing about this film is that it does this without being obviously nostalgic. The language used was very coarse at times and got the usual embarrassed laughs which was a shame as Bennett's wit means that cheap laughs arenot needed. 

Technically, I would have preferred not to have seen the boom mic in shot over and over again - this is slap-dash DP - very unlike Andrew Dunn's normal high standard. In fact there is a low-budget feel about the film despite the huge credit list but oddly this adds to the quality of the film overall. As for the actors, Richard Griffiths stands out in an Oscar level performance - in fact way better than most Oscar winners. Everyone else gives a quality performance - they don't seem to be actors at all! This is a film that will show on TV very well indeed, and if you don't get to see it at the cinema, get it on DVD.
