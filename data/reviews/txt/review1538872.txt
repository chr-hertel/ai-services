There is little good I can say about this film. The acting wasn't bad and the cinematography was pretty. That's about it.

On the bad side there is plenty. The plot could have been written on the back of a postage stamp. And what plot there was, was so clich√©d and obvious - it doesn't take long to work out what is going to happen and surprise, surprise it does, and to use not one but two deus ex machina events is plain laziness. 

But aside from the poor plot this film is awash with gratuitous, unnecessary violence. Whereas directors such as Cronenberg, Kubrick or Lynch use sporadic but intense violence for great dramatic effect, Gibson just gives us cut throat after cut throat, heart being ripped out after heart being ripped out and it frankly becomes boring and stupid.

In fact stupid is a good word for this film. The film offers nothing - it doesn't try to understand or dissect Mayan culture and neither does it offer a commentary on the modern world.

It is long, boring and totally pointless.
