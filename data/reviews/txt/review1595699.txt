There was nothing about TBS that I did not like. I've seen and heard many cultural references to this film, and never once did I concern myself with watching it. My friends finally convinced me to watch the theatrical version, and after the last piece of footage rolled, I was at a loss of words.

This film has a plot that is simply perfect, and I have found no flaws in it. It grasps you from the moment the first scene rolls, and you will be left staring at the screen during the credits. Sean Patrick Flanery's and Norman Reedus's powerful acting, along with the other characters, literally sucks you into the TBS experience. Action and adventure awaits you as you press the play button on your DVD player for this movie, and you will not be disappointed. A hint of comedy, reality, and the obvious diverse use of the "f-word" is something that TBS presents whole heartedly to the screen.

I strongly urge all who have not scene this piece of cinematic history to pick up a copy today.
