It was late and I was flippin' channels on cable. I caught this crap right from the beginning! I thought I recognized Cullen, and the old Transco Tower. Then I thought I saw the old Allen Parkway! What is this. I perked up for a minute, and then why oh why did I start to pay attention to the "acting"? It was a terrible. The kung fu was pitiful, the plot was even worse. It was so stupid I had to call my best friend to see if she was watching the same crap I was, and lo and behold!!!! My friends, she was witnessing the same thing I was!! It was amazingly awful what this director has never to record this for prosperity. This movie is so damn dumb I hope no one ever takes it as a serious slice of real thug life....this was so sad. I did recognize some homies in the film though. Don't be mad cause your girl didn't like it. We are still cool! I hope y'all got paid!
