People who complain about the artificiality of the plot in "An Ideal Husband" obviously have no familiarity whatsoever with Oscar Wilde's plays. The plots are always artificial. The knock on "An Ideal Husband" has always been that it is not as funny as some of the other plays and that it is overly dependent on romantic love, not a characteristic Wildean pose. Nevertheless, as a film, this may be the best realized of Wilde's plays. The cast is top drawer, including not only the principals (Jeremy Northam, Cate Blanchette, Rupert Everett, Minnie Driver and Julianne Moore as the play's beautiful villainness) but also the wonderful John Wood as the father of Everett's character. Wood isn't especially well known for his movie roles but he is one of the great English stage actors and he steals every scene he's in -- against rather stiff competition. Among the lead actors, Everett and Moore are especially good but they also have the best material to work with. Go see "The Importance of Being Earnest," of course, and "Lady Windermere's Fan," which are superior dramas. But I don't think they've been done on film as well as this one has.
