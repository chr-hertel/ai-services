It's definitely more then what you would expect, and it leaves you saying "Wow, I never saw that before!" The ape is incredible. The acting is very good. The special effects are fantastic. The lost evilish world of Skull Island is also magnificent. They did a great job taking this film to the next level. The only thing that doesn't make this movie a 10 is its length, and excessive footage of things that just don't seem to fit with the story. There are a couple of segments where the film just didn't need to go. All in all it is a good movie with tremendous special effects, and amazing shots of early 1900's New York. It will make you laugh and cringe and it will make you say "Wow!" It's a shame Universal go rid of that ride...
