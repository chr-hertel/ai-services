OK, this movie is hard to put into words...i believe the point of the film was to make YOU feel insane....its very jumpy and has good points ...i believe the "acting" was meant to be very dry and non emotional ..like you were reading the movie as apposed to watching it .... very poetic actually .... and thats why liked it ...i rented it out of curiosity and me, my woman and buddy spades-1999(user name on here)watched it one night, and he asked me "man, whats with you and all these weird, making no sense movies you put me through" ...lol...i don't believe him or my woman liked the movie, i however thought it was something .... I'm not sure what... but it spoke to me in a weird way ... and very few movies have done that so ill be buying it one day ...not for the $19.99 that hastings has been asking for it but a couple of bucks sure ..lol....if your wanting to watch something that will leave you saying "what did i just see?" then go for it, it does have things to offer an open mind ...
