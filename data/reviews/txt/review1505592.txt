So, I really enjoyed this movie. Everyone around me enjoyed it as well. I couldn't come up with anything that would make me say "Don't go see it" unless people don't like blood and guts getting ripped out of young chicks. I thought this was well put together, they made you like the cast, grow attached, and force you to watch them get dismembered by nasty monsters. How is that not good? The director did a great job in putting the cave chicks into a position where they had to kill or be killed, which normally happened in the latter. The cave creatures were great as well, nasty looking, slimy, fast, and killed with no remorse for whomever was around. They had one motive, EAT!!!! Not many movies make me sad when some of the characters die. This made me root all the way for the good guys when normally I laugh at every time someone else gets devoured. Anyways, I can't wait until this comes out on DVD. If you liked this movie you probably would also like 28 Days Later and Dog Soldiers. Both were European horror flicks that also enjoy splattered guts.
