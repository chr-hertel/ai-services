I LOVED this movie. Plain and simple, it's a hilarious movie. While not the same as any of their other movies, if you liked them, you'll love this one. As a fan of alcohol, this movie had an even greater hilarity factor for me. However, even if you completely abstain from alcohol use...its still a great flick! 

I'm not sure why it has gotten a 6.3 rating or so. It's completely undeserving of one so low, and is easily one of the funniest movies I've seen in quite a while, and by far the best comedy to come out this year.

Super Troopers was the first Broken Lizard movie I saw, and it instantly became one of my favorites. I couldn't wait for Club Dread, and after seeing it, I didn't enjoy that one as much. However, after seeing it again a few times and coming to enjoy its completely random banter and quotes, it came to grow on me and I enjoyed it almost as much as Super Troopers. I just watched Puddle Cruiser for the first time a week or so ago, and while its clearly their first attempt at a movie and many things are lacking, its still a very funny piece of work.

Beerfest jumped right into my top favorite movies with Super Troopers. Need I say more?
