It's not just a comedy, it's a tribute to our favorite soul men, Issac Hayes and Bernie Mac. Bernie Mac for his in your face style of comedy. And Hayes for his soulful singing voice, and his best remembered as the Duke in Escape From New York(1981), and has the voice of the chief on South Park. It a real sadness that there not with us anymore. But we'll always remember you Issac Hayes 1942-2008, and Bernie Mac 1957-2008.

The story begins when two former singers Named Floyd Henderson(Bernie Mac), and Louis Hinds(Samuel L. Jackson) in the seventies where in a group called The Real Deal. Now thirty years later, after learning about one of there partners named Marcus Hooks(John Legend), died of a heart attack. Despite a little old grudges with each other, Floyd and Louis decide to re-team anyway. But during a trip that might encounter misadventure. will they make it without killing each other first.

This was funny as ever, Samuel L. Jackson and Bernie Mac are like the perfect comedy team, they had great comic chemistry, it's a real sadness they won't team up again. It had funny slapstick, and great music also. Please don't miss it. Sure it drops a lot of F bombs, and it has some raunchy humor, but it never gets boring or stupid for a second.
