This is seriously the worst movie I've ever seen. Imagine the most annoying voice you can and then square that and that is the narrator. The narrator alone completely destroys any entertainment value to be had at films of cute baby animals.

The baby animals have an unbelievable adventure involving animals that I don't believe are even all native to the land. But that small continuity error aside, even if there were that many diverse species all living so close to one another it's impossible to believe that these animals would run into so many in just one day.

In addition, there are scenes that may not be suitable for children that show cruelty to animals. While this isn't the main reason I don't like the movie, it adds to the whole effect.
