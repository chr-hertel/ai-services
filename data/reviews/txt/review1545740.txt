this is a very satisfying movie experience for action fans and horror fans alike.the movie follows the story of an American serving in the french legion who during battle stumbles upon some ancient ruins, which hold secrets of its own and years later becomes part of the adventure of the American,a librarian and her nerdy but likable brother and several treasure hunters who all in the process awaken an ancient curse.what i liked the most about the movie the amazing adventure setting and the action sequences that go with it, the visuals,locations and sets are mouthwatering and fit perfectly with the characters in it. the movie also has a comedic charm to it with an array of likable and dislikable characters that are perfect for a good vs evil battle.the story and the acting are very good too.in the end this is a great movie that you should watch if you are an action/adventure fan and even if you're not you should check it out you might be surprised.
