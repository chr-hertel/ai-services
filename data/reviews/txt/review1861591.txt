This is the ultimate action film. Martial arts, cool weapons and it takes place on a battleship. This is also Seagal's best film by far. If you like action, Seagal delivers, however in Under Siege, Seagal probably gives the best performance of his career. Seagal is not the only actor to make this film great. There are also the roles of William Stranix and Commander Krill played by Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey. Both of these actors play the villain roles excellent, especially Tommy Lee Jones. The acting by Jones, allows the insanity of William Stranix to come to life on the screen. Aside from the acting, the effects and stunts are excellent and for action movie lovers, you will not be disappointed. Under Siege is my favorite action film and favorite movie of all time. I give it a 10 out of 10.
