I had seen Her Pilgrim Soul only once and, indeed, I didn't even know it was available on DVD until recently when I stumbled onto it in a sale bin. I loved it the first time and have been more than a little haunted by it ever since. I worried that my memory might be a bit too kind but that is not the case. I am very pleased to report that, even though film technology has moved ahead and some of the effects might be more impressively done now, this episode stands up very, very well indeed. Yeats has held up pretty well too so even that line resonates beautifully. No spoilers from me but let's just say that love doesn't really die. Buy it or rent it but go and get it! It really is wonderful and well deserves the numerous 10s it received.
