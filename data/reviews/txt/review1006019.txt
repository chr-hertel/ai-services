This is certainly not my sort of film, but after my girlfriend began complaining we always watch my movies, I prepared myself for 90 minutes of fake laughter and smiling to keep her happy, after all who else was I gonna take to see the new 'Clint' movie out.

However the opening scene with the tadpoles set the way for 90 minutes of top notch comedy, not exactly a laugh a second sort of comedy like Scary Movie or The Naked Gun, but a more all round sort of comedy where most gags hit the mark, certainly a major difference to Scary Movie! The casting is spot on, one of the major differences to the sequel. Bruce Willis is a great choice to play the voice of Mikey, and John Travolta is fantastic. But for me it was George Segal who stole the show for me, playing Mikey's real father, who in his words is going through a 'selfish phase'.

Sadly the sequels are simply terrible, but this movie is one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time, and I gave it 8/10.
