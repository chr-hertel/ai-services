Why, why did't u give her an Oscar for this s**t. They didn't even nominate her, now that's just cruel. Lopez was so fine in that in movie she was fantastic. She should of gotten something for her performance man. I had that movie since I was 10 years old. Ever since then, when there is nothing on, I watch J. Lo sing her a** off. That was a great movie, hands down. Olmos was awesome in there too. The greatest part was when Olmos and Lopez were arguing about Lopez's character getting married to their guitarist Chris. I watch that part over and over again LOL. The real Selena would be extremely proud of her if she was alive today.
