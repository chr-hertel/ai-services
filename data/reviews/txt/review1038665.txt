The Land Has Eyes is a unique film, depicting the people and culture of a small island that is otherwise invisible to most of the world. The movie beautifully captures the nuances and rhythms of life on a Pacific island, showing the depth of village culture today. It weaves in the realities of modern-day life (children getting western education, etc) with an age-old conflict that could have happened in a village five hundred years ago.

The writer and director, who is from Rotuma weaves in powerful themes to a simple story, such as that of female power and enduring justice, using elements from mythology. Most of the actors and actresses in the film are amateurs and they do a wonderful job of acting this first movie. 

I'd highly recommend this film for a glimpse into Rotuma's people and culture.
