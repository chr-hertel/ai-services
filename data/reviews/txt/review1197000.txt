Hal Larson as a young kid gets advice from his dying father not to settle for anything less than quality killer trim. However being superficial and slightly chunky himself, the beauties arn't really dropping at his feet. Until a chance meeting with guru Tony Robbins has him seeing hotties every where he goes, and these beauties actually want him. But there's one problem, only he can see them as hotties. Everyone else she's them a uglies, fatties, and trolls. He falls in love with Rosemary, a fatty who he sees as a knockout. Humorous situations arise when she does fat things but we see her as thin. This film wants to have it's lard and eat it too by inserting a Don Rickles type ending onto the film wherein after spending the majority of the act making fun of people, at the end of the act refuses to diffuse the situation by saying "..But really we are all brothers under our skin". But that didn't make the movie any worse, it's still hilarious, not as good as "Something about Mary", "Kingpin", "Dumb & Dumber" or "Me, Myself & Irene", but it's still vintage Farrely Brothers. Jack Black as always is the shiznit.
