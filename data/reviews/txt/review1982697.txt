Who could imagine that this planet could be run by primates instead of man? "Planet of the Apes" sure can answer that question well. You got in orbit, can a few years later you come back to Earth. Or do you? Three astronauts land back on Earth only to find out that man are the lowest forms of life, and the Apes(Chimpanzees, Orangutans, gorillas, etc.) are the majority of the population. George Taylor(Charton Heston, 1923-2008), and his crew have their clothes stolen and are captured by these apes. Taylor is shot in the neck and is unable to prove himself that he's not one of them primal humans. Only a duo of chimps: Zira and Cornelius are more curious about Taylor than any of the other apes around. The part I didn't like is where Taylor got hosed by one of the apes and when he tried to speak the ape said, "SHUT UP, YOU FREAK!" It is slightly funny, but in reality it's not. It was just a scene, nothing to get all hot about. I enjoyed it very much, at least we don't go round calling each other banana breath! HAHAHAHAHA!! (AHEM) It's not Monkey See, Monkey Do to these guys. They say, "Human See, Human Do!" 5 stars!
