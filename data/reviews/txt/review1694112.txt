I think that the movie this game is based on is fantastic. Sadly, the game is nowhere near as good. The highlights are that it has most of the movie cast providing voices for the game characters, and the two Batmobile driving sections are pretty good.

What sucks is the total lack of choice given to you. There is only ever one way to proceed. You get no choice in how to get somewhere, or where to go. For example, you can only attach your grapple to certain points. This linearity takes a lot of fun out of the game. You have rather anaemic punch ups with a couple of villains, then find the next door to walk through. Dull.

Basically, this game is only recommended if you rent it for a weekend, or get it VERY cheap. I got my copy for Â£5, and that was a little more than I think it's worth. There's simply no reason to replay the game once you've finished it.
