If your brother was accused of a murder, he didn't commit. Sentanced to death in a month. That brother being the only family you have left. Would you do everything to stop him from dying? Michael decided to do so. Its simply interesting to see, how a genius (in the word's original meaning) can manipulate everybody around him (and doing that with style). Not even every sci-fi series can compete with PB (prison break) in special effects and action.

To sum it up, PB is easily one of the best series out there. I recommend everyone to watch at least one episode. I can guarantee you, that if you watch the very first episode (Plot) you wont get enough, till you them all... happy watching...
