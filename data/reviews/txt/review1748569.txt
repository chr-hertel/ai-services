I'd read the book and loved the movie, but I put off watching the show because I didn't think that there was any way a TV series could deliver the same emotional impact.

I was wrong.

The show is fantastic and I hope it has a long and healthy run.

It's melodrama. It's soap opera. That being said, it rings true and captures the tone and angst of small-town, middle-class America, which is the backbone of its culture.

And the show is beautifully shot.

Actors don't have to worry about hitting their marks in what feels like an artificially stillness in most shows. Rather the camera chases the story and captures the emotion as if it were unfolding right before our eyes through a fractal of hyper-realism.
