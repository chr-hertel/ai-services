For a low budget short film, I think they made an honest effort. Okay, it's a bit cheesie and the effects are... pretty simple, but I have to give them credit for taking a run at it. Take it for what it is and enjoy the experience of what the writer and producer wanted to accomplish.

The story is actually good to my surprise. No big names of notoriety, but the characters still have something to offer

My advice... Don't go in to it with any expectations and you will be surprised. All in all, my gal pal and I liked the piece. It's the right length. Good pace. Any longer and it would have been too long. The story would have dragged out.
