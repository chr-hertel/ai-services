Hooligans is a spectacular football film and should be respected as a great movie...no doubt one of the best films of 2005 that didn't have a budget of $100 million. What struck me about this film is that it's directed by a woman. Which is very odd because you would'nt think a lady would know much about hooliganism, much less be interested enough in it to make a spectacular, brutal movie such as this. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire ride. But this film also has a message, particularly for Americans. There is much more going on in the world than you think there is, and in England...Europe in general, football is not just a game. It's life...and if you can't respect that, than don't go to England.All in all, I think this movie is great and deserves much praise, and many more awards than it's gotten.
