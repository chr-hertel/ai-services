I saw this film many years ago and as I remember I liked it, though it did seemed to me like anything special. It appeared to me like another action film about hit-man. I many times heard other people talking how great this film is and I couldn't understand how this movie is different from others. Now after few years I've watched it again, and now I realised it. Back then I was into action movies, so I've watched movies only to see some action, I didn't care much about a plot. This movie has some impressive action sequences, which were so beautifully filmed, that every minute of it was very enjoyable. But action isn't the most important thing about this film. What's important is an original story about unusual relationships between contract killer and a teenage girl. What else is good about this film is the colorfulness of it. Jean Reno was typical Jean Reno and that's good, he made a pretty original hit-man. Even more I liked Gary Oldman's performance, he always plays bad guys in movies so well, I think the movie would be much worse, if Stansfield was played by other guy.
