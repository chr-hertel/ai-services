It's an extremely rare occurrence when we stop a film after 10 - 15 minutes and remove it from the player. While we all realize that movies can't all be the same nor look alike there is a very basic formula that must be followed to keep the audiences attention. We felt that this movie failed on that score because both of us got up and started doing other things both to each other's surprise

The story is not a unique one. The small town, the lads, and the return of sister of one of the lads best friend. She been away, and values her virtue he on the other hand has ridden every bike in town. The two fall for each other so the story goes. Loves labors lost! Our problem was that it needed proper editing to keep the pace and momentum going. It was this little annoyance that prompted our early termination of said film. Now, this does not mean that the film is bad. We've both come across plenty of those and this isn't one of them.
