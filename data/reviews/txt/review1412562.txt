I found this to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Sword fights generally are entertaining because the suspense that the participants might get killed. But here, the participants are already dead, so who cares? The fights go on and on and on...

I realize that action movies often require the viewer to let go of reality and just enjoy the mindless entertainment. But as hard as I tried to be entertained, I kept finding the movie as thrilling as a junior high ballet recital.

The first part of the movie seemed promising, but it just went nowhere. I find it hard to believe that Disney's money and talent couldn't come up with something better than this...
