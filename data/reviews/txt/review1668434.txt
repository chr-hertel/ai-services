One meaning of "Terminus Paradis" is that all trains have to stop somewhere. This is true for human beings too as all of their journeys must inevitably end somewhere. This is precisely something which the maverick Romanian master Lucian Pintilie has shown in his film. At its core "Terminus Paradis" is an eccentric love story par excellence. When I say an eccentric love story, I mean that in this poignant story the end is not something which the lovers had always anticipated.The leading actress Dorina Chiriac has a charming doll like face. This has surely helped her to give dazzling touches to her very naive looking character. A lot can be said about Costel Cascaval's acting talents too. He has given a solid, convincing performance.Enjoy this film by drinking a lot of beer.
