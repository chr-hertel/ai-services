"Dodgeball" is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. And I watch many movies, all kinds of genres.

Comedies are supposed to make you laugh. "Anchorman" was very mediocre, but I at least had a few good laughs. Dodgeball was so unfunny, it was painful to watch. It was the first movie directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, and it showed. This won't look good on his short resume

There's a reason Hollywood is struggling. When you watch Dodgeball, you can see why when they release this crap and expect people to pay $8-plus to suffer through it. I didn't think the movie would be great, but I was shocked how lousy, clich√© and unoriginal it was.

Ben Stiller's character is TOO over-the-top, if that's possible, and simply embarrassing for his overrated career. Vince Vaughn can be a funny guy, but the writing is so atrocious, he's a pretty invisible character.

This review is a friendly warning so you don't waste 90 minutes of your time, which could be better spent picking up dog crap in the back yard.
