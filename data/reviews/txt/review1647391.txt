This is a truly excellent British film from the 1950's and, although hard to locate, is well worth searching for. From the opening credits to the satisfying finale, the film is a joy and one of the very best feel-good movies you will ever see. The story of a young city girl wanting to bring some beauty into the grim post war inner-city environment is gentle, touching and charming in equal measure, but never slips into mawkishness. This is helped enormously by the consistently brilliant playing of the whole cast - there is not a dud performance amongst them. The only puzzling aspect is why the juvenile leads, especially June Archer, never had successful acting careers. This film is unreservedly recommended to all who appreciate first class movie making!
