The fifty years old Jean-Claude (Patrick Chesnais) has a boring life, working in a notary office of his own and as court official evicting tenants or seizing properties, or spending the Sundays afternoons in the retirement home with his sour, rude and bitter father. When he has a minor heart problem, his doctor advises him to exercise, and Jean-Claude begins to have tango lessons in a studio in front of his office. He meets the charming forty and something years old Françoise (Anne Consigny), who is also having classes for her wedding party, and she recalls she was her neighbor in her childhood. They become close and love flourishes between them, changing their lives.

"Je ne Suis pas là Pour être Aimé" is a simple and pleasant romance. The story is credible, with human characters, effective screenplay, great direction and performances. The gorgeous Anne Consigny has one of the most beautiful and sweet smiles I have ever seen on the screen, and it is impossible not falling in love for such charming woman. The good actor Patrick Chesnais is miscast, with almost sixty years old in real life, and it is quite difficult to buy how such lovely woman would have a crush in such unattractive man. The melancholic music score is another plus in this nice film. My vote is seven.

Title (Brazil): "Dançar  Despertar de um Desejo" ("Dance  Awake of a Desire")
