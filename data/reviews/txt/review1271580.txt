When does an indie movie have so many mainline actors that its no longer indie? I don't know. With Glenn Close & Ray Finnes & John Heard -- and that other guy on Invasion -- well, the cast is deep. This movie keeps surprising you & you will NOT be bored or let down. I suggest you see it & forget about the drugs & suburbia & see how eventually "you get what you give." The soundtrack includes 1 track from Snow Patrol & 1 from Placebo -- both very great choices. It's not a pure comedy but the parents are truly real life caricatures. I live in NYC & I have truly met some parents who ARE these movie characters. Laughable, but unbelievable, yet real. There are no sudden endings that spring from nowhere. The movie unfolds & the characters always stay true to their parts. Please, check it out.
