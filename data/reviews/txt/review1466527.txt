Most of the time spin-off never lives up to its original, this movie is no exception. Worst of all, it has no connection with the first movie at all. I tried to like this movie, but the movie give me every reason not to. In the end it was much worst than I thought and worst than Daredevil which I hate.

Let me comment on this worst ever written comic screenplay. The story is terribly shallow, no point and leading nowhere, and no characteristic. Very disappointing. The things that are importances are left unattended but some silly stuff keep on repeating. The characters are very shallow, plus a sub-plot of romance between Elektra and Mark is totally unnecessary.

The only right thing in this movie seems to be the CGI, which have been done rather good. The directing is not so bad but with this shitty screenplay to work it doesn't seem quite working either. Though Elektra might be sizzling hot in her crimson red dress it doesn't go with the flow with the movie at all. It looks like women in her bra try to fight all the bad guys. And despite being an action movie, there ain't that much of action scenes that really satisfy me.

Recommendation: A Total Let Down From Beloved Jennifer Garner.

Rating: 3/10 (Grade: F)
