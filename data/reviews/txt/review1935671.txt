Its good to see Hollywood movie being made in Bollywood. The combination is not excellent, but though you will enjoy it. The movie has some message to give specially on having dreams and ready to take up the challenges as they come. And at last don't get depressed if you do not achieve your dreams, hope for the better tomorrow to come.

And Yes, I agree if Brian. If you are talking about Bollywood, then you have to include Bollywood elements to show how it differentiate from Hollywood, specially when this movie promotes singing and dancing. Bollywood presence was not properly highlighted and most the scenes are shot at same locations.

I think this movie would have been much better if some panoramic landscapes of India were shown, a little more of Bollywood essence was added and instead of Rahim(I don't know who is this actor) some other talented heart throb was in the film.
