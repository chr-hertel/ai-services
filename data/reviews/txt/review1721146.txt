Wonderful sequel to "The Trouble With Angels."

Rosalind Russell repeats her original role as a Conservative nun who slowly begins to realize that the church is part of the new world.

In this sequel, Russell is equally matched in acting by a fine performance by Stella Stevens, who portrays Sister George. Unlike the original with Hayley Mills, there is deep conflict in this film between Russell and Stevens who battle over controversial ideas.

I loved the song that is played throughout the film. It's the title of the movie. I enjoy the syncopation that arrives with the word follows.

Van Johnson, Arthur Godfrey, Milton Berle and Robert Taylor briefly appear before and during the trip of the students and faculty of St. Francis to an inter-faith youth rally in California.

Too bad that the rally itself is never shown. It would also have been nice to see Hayley Mills in this sequel.
