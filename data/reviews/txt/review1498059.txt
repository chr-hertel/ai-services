I didn't give it a 10 because it doesn't have a wonderful story line. The couples of the writer and the maid & the two little kids is realistic and sweet. The president's love is unnatural although it's cute. The two porn actor and actress's is just so gross. Unnecessary porn. They shouldn't be there. And the ugly guy went to the U.S. and just get 3 beautiful girl on his arrival. What has the U.S. become? A third country supplying "hen"? The movie itself is too long because of these flaws. It deserve a 5 up to this point.

Now its OST and the action of the casts save the day. The song is excellent and well-fit with the movie. Billy Mack win Love Actually two additional points for the old singer character. The extraordinary effort of the cast save the awful script and win the rest one point.
