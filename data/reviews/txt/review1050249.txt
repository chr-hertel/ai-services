Being a massive Sofia Coppola fan, I was looking forward to seeing this film. When I finally got the chance, it wasn't what I expected - it was different, and perhaps, better than my interpretation.

I think it was really the fact that there was dialogue than I'd have imagined and that it was restrained and passionate in equal amounts. Getting criticism out of the way first, I really hoped there'd be more focus on the sisters separately and less than on the boys, but perhaps that's what made it so special and poignant.

It's an odd and difficult for some, story to swallow, but it's captured by Coppola's unique, eclectic style of script and direction and transformed into an absolutely beautiful, mesmerizing piece, camera-work reminiscent to that used in "Heavenly Creatures" and the teenage boys' points of view similar to "Stand By Me." While the narration and views on the captivating Lisbon sisters is thoughtful and sensitive, what really makes the film arresting and irresistible is Coppola's vivid imagery: Hartnett and Dunst entwined on the crisp playing field, the youngest daughter floating in the bath...these are images you don't forget in a hurry.

If there were more focus, perhaps, on the Lisbon family, then more could've been done with it, but the actors make the most of what they have: Woods is typically brilliant as the father, Turner heartbreakingly reserved as the mother, Hartnett cocky and charming and you can tell Coppola thinks Dunst's face is something special - it floats over every other shot like a beautiful angel, contrasted with her bad-girl Lux.

The film may come as a surprise, but you won't want to switch it off: from the opening scene to the end, it'll stay with you - and you'll want it to.
