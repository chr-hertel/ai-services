The world once again owes the UK a debt of thanks...not only have they produced the funniest and most original shows around, but consistently up the bar when it comes to comedy. If you have not witnessed the original Office, please do yourself a favour and watch it. If you like subtle cringe worthy jokes, and well crafted dialogue...you'll die laughing. In my mind Ricky Gervais is leading a strong resurgence of smart comedy, not relying on the easy dick and fart jokes. Witness 'the dance', a posh pair of boots, and a motivational speech that will leave you in tears. Also, check out Ricky's podcast on iTunes, as it is one of the funniest things I have ever heard...you'll will hear the shaved monkey that is Karl Pilkington on topics ranging from; toe-heads, jellyfish,freaks, how older people don't eat Twix, and monkey news. Do yourself a favour, listen, watch and laugh.
