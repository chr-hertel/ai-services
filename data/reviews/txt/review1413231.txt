I think this movie should be accepted for what it is, a fantasy that takes place at sea. Like the first movie, this one also carries large holes in the plot. Instead of explaining questions left unanswered by the first movie, this POTC jumps into a plot just as twisted. It would have been nice to get more background in this second film, so the characters could have been a bit more developed. Despite the major flaws, I have to say that Johnny Depp really carries the film well in his performance of Jack Sparrow. I do not believe this film can be put into the category of "pirate movie". It relies too much on the special effects when more attention should be paid to story development.
