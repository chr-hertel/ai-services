The film for me is very realistic and practical, it's funny but what made me like the movie is that i cried almost 10 times while watching this film.I hope that someday i could meet Brittany and Dakotta so that i could congratulate them and also to congratulate the director cause he managed to make a film of great portrayal! I really love Brittany even in her other films like Just Married for me she's one of Hollywood's Gem because in her portrayal as the nanny of Dakotta she is absolutely Adorable and worth crying for. Dakotta have also done impressive acting, she is amazing, very great performance.This is truly an excellent Heartwarming Comedy!
