This TV film should not be called Brave New World, as it is different from Huxley's vision of Utopia in the novel. The film has never been made into a faithful version of the book because the rights to the book are in dispute.

People who view the TV version think that they are watching a film made of the book, but they most certainly are not.The acting and directing are poor, and the sets are cheesy.

Read the book, and hope that some day, a good director will be able to make the actual events in the novel come to life.
