The movie Stargate, which introduced (sort of) the concept of instantaneous interstellar travel via a gate made more famous by the subsequent TV series, is most interesting in the first half-hour, when the prospect of uncovering the secrets of the device tantalize the viewer. James Spader conveys this curiosity and channels his quest to discover the gate's secrets to the audience. Lindfors is also very good as an elder scientist who feels Spader is the answer to all the questions. Kurt Russell's range as a military officer is limited here; he's introduced as suicidal due to his son's recent death, but is quite stoic and just grim throughout. He's obviously a 'can do' soldier and leader, but also anticipates his later robotic fighter in "Soldier" 4 years later. After the action moves off Earth to what's on the other side of the gate, our anticipation to find out what's there is rewarded by little more than a variation on "Dune"(84) done in more formulaic style.

A formula is what partners Emmerich and Devlin present, as is always the case in their movies - successful formulas, to be sure, but nothing to get surprised over. Even if you know nothing about one of their films beforehand, about 20 minutes in you may have it all figured out. Here, the expedition finds a 'desert' world and are soon expected to help the natives against an alien tyrant (Jaye Davidson, his unusual persona taken advantage of). Are we all surprised by such a plot? Of course not. The special FX are pretty impressive, especially the shots of the huge flying pyramid and some of the landscapes. They also have some impressive crowd shots which add to an epic scale of storytelling. But, there's very little emotional attachment to the unfolding struggle - it's all by the numbers and even Spader can't inject much feeling into any of it. The next project, "Independence Day" was probably more successful because our own cities were being destroyed, not some far-off planet we care very little about.
