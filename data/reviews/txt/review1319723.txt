okay, okay, you don't agree with the heading of best movie ever. however, consider this: this movie has all the ingredients to qualify.,2 of the greatest screen stars, with an awesome supporting cast, a plot that keeps the view totally interested until a very surprising ending, scenery and wardrobe that puts you right into that era, and to top it all off, how could you not love the Scott Joplin, ragtime music performed by Marvin Hamlisch? this is the total feel-good movie that you just cant resist. its not very often you come across a movie where everything hits on all cylinder's, and i know some people might not put this in the Citizen Kane category, but all in all if a movie is for entertainment value, then this a true 10..again, best movie ever!!
