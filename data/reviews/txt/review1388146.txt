I have never been a fan of Cuba Gooding Jr., and never will be .. His facial expressions just does not let him be taken seriously, in my opinion .. You may think that, that trait would make him a good cast for the lead role, but his character is just too silly and clumsy that you will never understand how he is the successful and rich dentist in the movie .. He looks and acts like a 12 year old spoiled child, with an even 'smaller' mind age .. The movie feels like a fairy tale, where the scenario can possibly be overlooked by kids, but not by adults .. The story had great potential of being a wonderful family movie .. But both the actors and director and other stuff just does not seem to care thinking about how to formulate the scenes in an intelligent way to make it an all-ages movie .. They just choose the easy way with unimaginative slap-stick jokes, which you see coming from miles away .. No big surprises nor small witty touches in the dialog that would appeal the viewer, but a stereotype ending where the-guy-who-comes-from-the-city and does-not-know-a-single-thing-about-huskies saves the day .. I found the whole idea boring .. The dogs were charming, the small number of mountains scenes were beautiful .. But the whole experience is just forgettable, and probably you will regret the time you spend for it ..

On the other hand .. If you want to show your kids a movie they can enjoy, this IS the movie .. No deep plot, nice doggies, a hero guy, and funny (!?) jokes .. For the adults, I recommend something else, several other Disney movies but not this one .. Rating: 8/10 for kids (some intelligent kids may find it boring :), 2/10 for adults (for brief glimpses of snow covered mountains and the dogs) ..
