Wow, this movie was really awesome. I know for most guys they probably may not enjoy it because it is a chic flick. I thought the movie was really cute. I didn't know much about the movie before i watched it, but i just couldn't believe what it was about when i watched it. It was a really good romantic comedy,and honestly i haven't seen on of those in a really long time. I recommend to everyone that you watch it because of how good it is. Reese Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo did such an amazing job. They honestly made a really great movie! I honestly couldn't believe how cute this movie was. If you don't know what the movie is about, then i recommend that you go read the plot about it, because it was one of those movies, that was really cute, it would make you screen at the TV,i know i did because i wanted something to happen, and i wasn't sure if it was or wasn't going to. I recommend you see it, it is amazing!
