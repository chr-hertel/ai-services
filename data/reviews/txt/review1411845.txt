As always with the second and subsequent third in the trilogy, there is temptation not to get too excited about this latest Pirates of the Caribbean installment - remember the Matrix sequels anyone?! Perhaps it was this neutral attitude that Dead Man's Chest was so enjoyable but for even the biggest Pirates or Depp fans are going to be delighted with this.

From Jack's reuniting with the Pearl to the thunderous battle with Davy Jones' mutinous undead on vivid tropical sands, this is a $200m winner make no mistake because the box office take is going to explode and it only leaves you hungry for more upon it's cliffhanger crescendo that leaves plenty of questions unanswered and then asks a few more for good measure.

Never before have you desired to be a crusty, barnacled sea-urchin so much!
