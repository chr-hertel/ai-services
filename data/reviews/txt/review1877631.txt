Here Comes Happiness was released in March of 1941, so we hadn't been dragged into the war yet. Mildred Coles plays Jessica Vance, the young heiress who isn't so sure she wants to marry the society bigshot that her mother has picked out for her. She gets her own apartment, meets the locals, and tries to find her own prince charming. It's a lot like watching an episode of Father Knows Best - no surprises, no big names, plain, simple entertainment based on misunderstandings. One of Warner Brothers shorties - only 57 minutes. Edward Norris does a good job as one of the suitors. Keep an eye out for William Hopper, the son of Hedda Hopper, as Blaine's original best man. This was one of the last films directed by Noel Smith -- he only made a couple more after this. It's also ironic that they keep talking about going to Honolulu, since in just a few months, terrible things were about to happen there...
