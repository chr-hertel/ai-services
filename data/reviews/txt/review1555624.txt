I was so excited last night when the movie The Balck Daliah was released to DVD and I had rented it from blockbuster. I stayed up all night with my dad knowing I had to got to work the next day but I didn't care...this was the Black Daliah. I had heard tons about her murder and now I was going to find out what really happened.....only I was sadly disappointed. The guidelines and the basic idea of the story failed to completely capture and forever hold my attention. I found my mind drifting in some of the more important parts and then having to rewind it to figure out what I had missed. In completely word the movie could have been so much more then what they made it out to be. And I'm sorry to say that it was poor judgment for Josh Harnett to act in such a poorly detailed film.
