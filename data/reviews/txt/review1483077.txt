the burning is one of the best slasher movies of the 1980's,even if its compared to Friday the 13th.it features a then unknown cast;Brian matthews,Leah ayres,Jason Alexander(seinfield)holly hunter(raising Arizona)fisher Stevens(hackers,short circuit)a horribly disfigured camp counselor named cropsy seeks revenge and begins killing campers and counselors,in very graphic and gory fashion.the make-up effects were created by tom savini who also did Friday the 13th 1 3 and 4.its kind of funny to see a pre seinfield Jason Alexander playing a teenager. not to mention a great actress like holly hunter making her debut. i personally thought this was better then Friday the 13th,and don't consider this a rip-off.call me crazy but ill give the burning 8 out of 10.
