Saw a screener of "Aunt Rose" (under the original title "No One Gets Out". The story will be very familiar to fans of "Last House on the Left", "Funny Games", or "House on the Edge of the Park". A group of real nasty criminals holds a family hostage and that ultimately turns out to be their biggest mistake (with a very cool supernatural twist, however.) While it treads familiar ground, "Aunt Rose" is definitely one of the better "70's revival" films I've seen in recent years. Writer/actor Joshua Nelson has written an excellent script, the dialog is never clunky, and he keeps the story moving nicely. The performances are miles ahead of what you usually find in low-budget horror. You feel honest to god sympathy for the tormented family. Newcomer Velocity Chylld is a standout, turning in a completely cold, brutal performance.

Solid brutal horror from start to finish.
