Well being a student and someone who works in a cinema i see all the movies for free, this is both a privilege and a curse - in the case of Herbie fully loaded it was a curse!! The film is awful, I've seen less wooden acting in a forest, Lindsay Lohan cant act and the plot seems to be non existent...

the movie seems to rely on the use of well known actors and actresses to pull off what is otherwise a show of computer generated graphics i can see how it would be popular for small kids however having seen the original Herbie movies as a child i was mortified when i saw that they had given Herbie eyes and a mouth (the bumper moves like a mouth)..

in short id have preferred to have been given the almost 2 hours of my life i spent watching this movie back to watch something more worthwhile or even study
