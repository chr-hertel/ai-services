man this was a fun movie to watch. suspense at every corner while they were on that bus - and even after the bus stops it keeps going! rent this one if you haven't seen it if you like action films or Sandra Bullock too.

Dennis Hopper palys a decent enough bad guy - basically he's supposed to act a bit insain so you have to accept that reality, but heck you might as well because he's putting a bomb on a bus with a speedometer trigger and the bus end up clearing a huge gap in the freeway while airborne so there is a lot you have to just accept to enjoy the film anyway. Overall an excellent action flick.
