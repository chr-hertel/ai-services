Ace director Sol Hogwash gets into scrapes a la SAFETY LAST with both cameraman and director hazardously sliding in and out windows high above the traffic filled street - no trams, but plenty of fancy turning in intersection. Studio driver (Billy Bevan using moustache to usual effect) spies thro' keyhole on the star who seems to be in the bath, but revealed simply on couch. Billy lets the studio lion loose, frightening the stylishly dressed and slinky star and her uppity elder male patron. Somehow, the limousine takes off with lion, not lady, with much tussling in the back seat amid traffic. Lots of rushing about antics and pulling faces by a cast who had done this stuff before, but get a kick out of sending up their workplace, it seems.
