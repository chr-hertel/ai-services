People should learn from history, and yet we keep on repeating some vicious circles. Much praise is to be given to Spielberg's courage for exploring a moment in history that many would choose to forget. There are outstanding moments in this film, from its near perfect direction by Spielberg, a man who seems incapable of making a bad film to Eric Bana's moving portrayal of a man tortured by circumstances he has very little power to change.

The film is not perfect, moving a little too slow at times and would have benefited by the removal of a few redundant scenes, but it carries a big powerful punch, one that it isn't easy to ignore. In fact, there were a few people discussing it outside the theater, and it amazed me how little they had chosen to understand.

It will probably be a controversial work of art, and that is what is supposed to be as long as it makes people "talk" instead of choosing other more destructive ways to solve problems. It is a movie that should be seen, discussed, and used as an example by people who want to make the world a better place.
