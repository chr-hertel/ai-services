This movie is just simply fantastic. Every second of it is edge-of-seat sweaty-palms gasping ACTION. And I'm not saying that because its an action film because is really not. Its a thriller, but one played so beautifully, with characters casted like out of heavens, AFTER SEEING THIS MOVIE, ONE CANNOT DENY SPIELBERG'S ABILITY TO DELIVER.

I don't know how to describe it. But it was so good, so very very good that even until the very end my heart was pumping. Its incredible because it makes you feel like every single character at once, you can feel for them, feel the moment. Even though it sounds corny, when you watch the movie your attention span will not even flinch. This is truly a great movie and watching it has been one of life's greatest experiences. RECOMMENDED FOR ANYBODY.
