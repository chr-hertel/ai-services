Very,very funny...with actual(a bunch of)laugh out loud moments.

Sick and twisted...and sometimes poignant story of love and friendship and the importance of both.

This film about slackers is to be enjoyed by all... slackers, management, rich people, slackers, animal lovers, potheads, those who have completed rehab,Star Wars fans, Lord of the Rings fans, slackers, and of coarse animal lovers.

Truly a film for all the people, and something for everyone to relate to. If you need a laugh, this is the flick for you. Go see this movie now, you won't regret it.

Mr. Smith stays true to the characters we know and love(and if you don't know and love them... you will). He also adds a few characters to the fold and they are a pleasant surprise who manage to shine and fit in with the"Clerks" veterans.

I know this was a vague review, but I hate giving away details(hate to spoil even the littlest of jokes).
