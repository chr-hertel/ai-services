I really liked this movie. The idea is not super original by any means, but I think the performances made it seem refreshing. I thought that all of the actors played their parts well, especially DW Moffett. He made me cringe with annoyance and feel bad for him, which is no easy feat.

I thought the storyline moved at a nice pace, but I feel that this film would have been improved by fleshing out more the relationship between Sonny and his son. I think that Trevor Wright is a great actor and that his talents were a little wasted in his small part.

For a first time feature for Mr. Phelps, I say congratulations as this film was very good and he really directed the performers well and wrote a script that is true to life. Well Done!
