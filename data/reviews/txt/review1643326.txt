Although both movies have certain similarities, Victorian, magicians, beautiful people, twist endings, there is one huge difference, "The Illusionist" is enjoyable while "The Prestige" is a pretentious, manipulated, confusing, mess. The character development is especially weak, the accents barely intelligible, and the time jumps annoying. If the movie had played out in an orderly fashion, it might have proved more enjoyable. I cannot recommend "The Prestige". If you must see a magical movie, and enjoy being manipulated toward a twist ending, then "The Illusionist" is your movie. At least it makes a little bit of sense. Rate "The Illusionist" 7.0, "The Prestige" 3.0 - MERK
