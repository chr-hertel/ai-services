The language (cursing) by the father is appalling; he acts like a belligerent drunk throughout most of the movie. The mother is a half wit. Just an all around bad movie. Despite the glowing reviews, our entire family (2 adults, 4 children) detested this movie. It was a unanimous decision.

Plus, the outline of Cleveland but it is based near Chicago? Also, some lewd material (the lamp) and bloody scenes (fight). We were very disappointed since we looked forward to seeing this movie based on recommendations. My advice, if you are looking for a nice family holiday movie look elsewhere.

Terrible movie.
