Here is a quote from another review of this movie: 

"The early 1970s has some of the most blatant anti-Christian messages ever put out by Hollywood filmmakers and this is Exhibit A. You can just feel the hatred of these atheists pouring out in this movie. There are not one but two separate instances of picturing phony and blasphemous preachers in here. That, plus a ton of GDs, mostly said by Angie Dickinson, make this a despicable, extremely bigoted film".

Huh? (Scratching my head), it's just a movie...it's not real life!

This is a great '70s movie about gangsters in the early part of the century. What is not to like. The ever present bad acting of William Shatner. The beauty of Angie Dickinson. Tom Skerritt, Noble Willingham, Royal Dano, Sally Kirkland. What a cast of characters! The music of Jerry Garcia. Produced by Roger Corman. What is not to like? If you have never seen it, I think you will get a kick out of it. '70s movie making at it's best. Period!
