The original show with the Trademark crew was one of my favorite shows when it aired - never missed it. I was very disappointed when I saw the new shows with the Montelongos. I've been meaning to log on and find out why Trademark is no longer the focus. I never expected to see such a huge backlash towards A&E, and that so many people share my opinion.

Armando Montelongo is an arrogant jerk. It's completely nauseating how everyone around him is so subservient! It's hard to pick which of them to loathe the most - Armando for being so cruel and demeaning or the wives for being so obnoxiously servile. They all get under my skin. I watched a few of the shows but I was so irritated and disgusted that I can't watch anymore.

Aside from their apparent moral and ethical deficiencies, their work was substandard. One episode that stands out is the mushroom growing toilet, when Armando planned to slap some superficial fixes on top of that festering plumbing / foundation mess. Thankfully he went on vacation when the final decision was made. If that's they way he works I'd hate to see his other properties.

I miss Trademark. I wish the show would have stayed with them. If the show continues, hopefully A&E will take a hint. I'll be watching out for Trademark on other networks.
