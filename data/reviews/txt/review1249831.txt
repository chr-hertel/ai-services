I watched this film yesterday when it was repeated on the Sci-Fi channel, I'm too young to remember the 'Six Million Dollar Man' and 'The Bionic Woman' the first time round but I can remember watching repeats of the shows.

I enjoyed this movie although I did feel like it spent a little bit too long setting up the situation rather than resolving it.. but that's a small niggle when you have two very watchable characters played by actors who seem to be having a ball.

I would say this was made more for fans of the shows rather than new viewers, since it doesn't spend a lot of time re-introducing the older characters.
