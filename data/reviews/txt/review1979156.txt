Zeitgeist is one of the most powerful documentaries that I have seen in the recent years. It's beautifully organized and incredibly subtle despite the drastic and controversial themes it touches on. Its authors are not imposing their views on you, their arguments are lucid and convincing. Those who claim that Zeitgeist is no more than anti-Christian propaganda and another conspiracy theory are not fair, and they are aware of it. Anyway, the film is not about Christianity, but about being lied to, about the power of lies, and about our being naive, our inability to distinguish between the authority based on truth and the truth based on authority. As for 9/11, Zeitgeist will show you what you think but are afraid to say. I wonder which corporate TV will have the guts to broadcast it first. The rumor has it BBC is thinking of showing it soon. I doubt it, though.
