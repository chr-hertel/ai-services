First off, the DVD cover image above is from the wrong movie. That cover image is from the 1998 film also known as Voodoo Dawn (aka: Fait Accompli) which starred Michael Madsen and Rosanna Arquette. This film was released 8 years prior and in my opinion is a much better movie, although that isn't saying much considering the comparison. It is actually about voodoo/zombies whereas the other is more of a crime melodrama. The 1990 Voodoo Dawn isn't Oscar worthy itself but it does have its cheesy charm. If you are a zombie fan (like me) be prepared for more traditionally created zombies than the Romero shamble-type zombies. This movie also has an early appearance of Tony Todd before he became Candyman.
