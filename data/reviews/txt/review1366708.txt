If you have tired of movies that rely more on shock and awe than depth; if you yearn for classic tales of internal struggles and powerful metaphors brought to life with care and compassion, but no other agenda, then this film is a must see. However, if you are below 35 and haven't read a work of classic literature since one was assigned to you in college; if your collection of xbox or PS2 games exceeds the titles of poems by Yeats, Frost, Keats, or Whitman you could recite; if you need special effects and unique action sequences to feel like a movie was "worth your money," then this movie, this brilliant movie is not for you.

An American Haunting, no doubt, could work on the stage, the screen, or the page. The characters and their flaws drive the story, not situations contrived by some Hollywood wunderkind. The direction is not flashy, instead you see the space granted to allow the actors to nurture the turmoil at the core of the characters they portray. Rachel Hurd-Wood is brilliant, powerful. Donald Sutherland gives his best performance since Spacecowboys. Solomon brings so much to the screen as both writer and director that you admire his courage and heart for knowing this story deserves to be told. Nothing feels contrived, much of the criticism other users site about pace relates to a failure to recognize the characters internal struggle is the conflict, the story, the dramatic tension. It is not the action, but the action's impact on these people that matters. If you appreciate such fine work, please go and see this film and encourage others to do the same. Mature work that respects the heritage of great story telling should be honored.
