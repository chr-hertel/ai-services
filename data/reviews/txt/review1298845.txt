With the name Mona Lisa Smile, it seems that the movie was supposed to have been centered more on Julia Roberts rather than the girls she must inspire. At times it seems as though the movie tried to break out of it and focus on Julia dealing with her own inequities rather than dealing with the system. And when it did that, the movie became much more interesting. But I have an awful feeling that the box office draw of the Dead Poets Society might have been too influential and that a greater emphasis was placed on railing against the conformity. The result was a paint by numbers movie lambasting a paint by numbers artist box. It devolved into a clich√©d, hamhanded movie. For my money, its better to put it in the class of School Ties rather than Dead Poets Society.
