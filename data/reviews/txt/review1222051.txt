Sadly I couldn't play the first game since I don't have a gaming console, but I was absolutely excited when i found out that the second X-men Legends game would also be made for the PC. Speaking as an X-men fan..this game is great! About 20 playable characters (X-Men + The Brotherhood), cool powers (tho it did somewhat bother me that some we're not equal to the powers in the comics, for example Wolverine doesn't automatically heal), good voice-work (I really like the fact that they only used Patrick Stewart from the movies in this game), the story in the game is quite good (even tho a bit clich√©, but it's obvious that Raven did try and succeed in creating a good comic-book story), the AI is OK i suppose (you only control one x-man at a time, the other 3 that are in your team are controlled by the computer but they really do seem to be able to take care of themselves quite well), the Danger Room (a cool thing, where you get to beat challenges and level up)..This part of the game is very well done and deserves praise. But speaking as a gamer..The game is fairly easy and soon you get the feeling that it's all just a routine (a fun one tho) when you keep beating up zounds and zounds of enemies, most of the levels are quite well-done, but it's obvious that some parts are only there for you to kill a lot of enemies and Level Up. The graphics make up a good comic-book feel and are good, but nothing really special...I'd give this game a 7/10, it has plenty of action, the story/characters are good, X-men and the Brotherhood team up, fun and exciting boss fights and it's quite long. Otherwise it's a bit too easy and a bit routinely done...
