Not a bad little film in many ways when you consider when it was made by MGM - clearly as the opener in a Double Feature Bill. The cast is surprisingly good with perhaps Dan Dailey as the standout, and playing the brother of Donna Reed and never able to go straight despite all her efforts. Robert Sterling goes over the top in his early scenes, but settles down as the story progresses. Charles Winninger as the drunken Doctor has some fine and not-so-fine moments in a major role, and it was great to see one of the good old B-players in Veda Ann Borg. The shoot-out near the end was ideal for a programmer and would have left audiences in those days in a good frame of mind for the Main Attraction
