There's nothing about this film that you probably have not heard. It is the film that introduced the young Barron Christopher Guest to his future wife, Jamie Lee Curtis. They are one of today's most successful and happy couples in Los Angeles. While Jamie lee has never been directed by her husband, Christopher Guest must be one of the shyest geniuses in Hollywood today. He has never casted his famous wife or equally famous in-laws (Janet Leigh or Tony Curtis). I thought he directed this film. He did not but Rob Reiner who plays in it too. I have seen most of Christopher Guest films like Best in Show, A Mighty Wind, and I just adore his directing style. He has the same group of talented actors like Michael McKean, Harry Shearer, JEnnifer Coolidge, Jane Lynch, Parker Posey, Catherine O'Hara, EUgene Levy, etc. This film shows the beginning of his genius as well. It is written by the stars and not some nameless screenwriters. In fact, actors and actresses so adore working with Guest as a director that they are always returning to work with him again and again. He should be recognized for his wittiness and unique brand of humor that he has wonderfully given us. Too bad he is happily married.
