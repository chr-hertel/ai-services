I just went and saw a really nice movie that quite frankly, I almost didn't bother going to see if it were not for my friend suggesting it. The movie stars James Fransico from the spiderman movies who has really managed to find himself a nice role that will really distinguish him as someone who can do a good job with dramatic roles.He actually managed to take on a 'James Dean' type of presence throughout the whole movie. It was a very accurate portrayal of "dogfights" in WW1. The action was amazing but not out of reality. The actual authenticity of the way things were back then was done on an excellent scale. You were really given a sense of how everything was for them back in that era down to the last detail. The storyline itself is very suspenseful to the very end and they even manage to give you a realistic 'love story' that would actually happen between a man and woman in the war. You could really feel the sense of 'honour' and 'brotherhood' between the different pilots. This is definitely a real 'man's movie".
