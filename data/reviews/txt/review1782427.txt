Everyone that I know that has seen this movie think I'm crazy for not liking it so much. It was like I Robot 2, except more boring. It was like mixing Cast Away with Silent Hill. I mean, it has its good parts, don't get me wrong. But I fell asleep quite often. Will Smith is a good actor as well, but his masterpiece will always be Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Like I said, a lot of my friends think I'm insane for not liking the movie, and I don't wanna spoil this movie for anyone, but I probably would have enjoyed Alvin and the Chipmunks better. Let's just face it, the best movies this year has to be either Superbad or Knocked Up! There hasn't been a great action thriller since Terminator 2!
