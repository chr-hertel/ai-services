If you have read Bugliosi's true crime account, than don't miss this.

This would be a necessary viewing for anyone with a vague interest in true crime in general or documentaries too.

Did it deserve an Oscar? I think so.

Filmed before the killings, (most of it anyway) but released after, it made you wonder why the signs weren't noticed earlier.

Charlie preaches the typical hippie shtick and his wide-eyed, spacey followers talk about love and knives in the same thought. If there was ever a graphic anti-hallucinogenic drug ad, this was it.

This needs a new DVD release with updates and special additions. Someone get on it. It's worth it.
