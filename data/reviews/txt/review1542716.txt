Sure, this wasn't the most realistic movie ever, but why does it have to be? A lot of people complained that Nicholas Cage didn't die. How can there be a movie if the main character dies? He could have been in less dangerous places but who wants to see that? And if you want to learn about the Windtalkers and World War Two than you probably shouldn't have rented a movie starring Nicholas Cage and Adam Beach. I'm glad that it wasn't a story about Windtalkers and World War Two. I got to school to learn about those things. I rented this movie to see some action and be entertained, not learn a lesson on history. I don't see why everyone hates this movie so much. It might not have been true to the actual events but I wasn't expecting it to be and I liked it.
