What can i say about this doco? The subject matter of soldiers suffering from serious injuries and trying to get on with there lives has been done before and usually is so over the top emotionally that it leaves a cheesy taste in your mouth. This doco is an exception to that rule. The subject matter is still handled in a sensitive way and by the end of the doco no-one can deny that these guys have been through a lot and should be admired for their bravery and positivity. Beyond Iraq doesn't get soppy or over the top at any point, it stays positive and allows you to see these guys living life to the full despite their traumatic past experiences. The visuals and editing are snappy and the soundtrack is perfectly suited to the subject and emotion of this great short documentary. Hope to see more from this guy cos he definitely has a future in documentaries.
