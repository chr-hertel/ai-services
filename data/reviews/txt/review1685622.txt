Before this movie came out, i don't even know what the "Transformers" are. Even when i first saw the poster of this movie, i didn't really interested in it. But, when the trailer comes out, i expected it would be great. And when i saw it, i realize that it's more than great. It's amazing.

For people that wasn't really "Transformers's" fans, i think, as long as you like fantasy-action movie, you'll like this one too. Like me! The point is this movie can take many new fans, not only the "old" fans. And when some people say only boys will like it, they were totally wrong. Even if you're a girl, you will still amazed by this movie.

It's also amazing how they can manage to combine the computer work and the real work. The actors are also amazing. It's amazing how they can act like the robots are really there, while they weren't.

It wasn't really surprising to know that this movie is amazing. Why? Because it directed & produced by two of the greatest director & producer i know, Michael Bay & Steven Spielberg.

I highly recommended this to any Tranformers fans or non-fans, especially a fantasy-action movie fans. I think if you like movie such as Power Rangers or Star Wars, you'll like this movie too.
