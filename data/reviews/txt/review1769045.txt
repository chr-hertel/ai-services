In rather wishy-washy Technicolor, this comedy of manners which the US did so well, and the UK less so, puts Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon together (they would make a good team in Wuthering Heights as well) as the couple who set off on a mistaken identity trial where Olivier's barrister thinks he is arranging the divorce of Oberon's husband because of her staying in his hotel room ...

It is a story that's been done a lot, and often better than this, but the playing of the leads means there is a certain amount of comedy and a bit of a mischievous spark from Oberon, who knows she has to catch this particular fish, but hatches an elaborate plan to do so.
