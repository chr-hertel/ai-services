Adam Sandler does a great job in this movie. I just came back form a sneak screening at the Scotia Bank Theatre in Vancouver, and I gotta say, one of his best films in a while. However, it was lacking in the subplot category.

Rob Schneider, as much as I love him in doses, was too much and too little at the same time. But it's made up for with great jokes, and awesome whit. The mother, the awesome slow motion montages of old women getting it on, the over packed buldge, The Mariah Carey shirts, the HUMMUS! All very funny And the BEST part was the underlined theme of the movie that dealt with prejudice and intolerance. And also a great line/prop shots thanks to Mariah Carey 9 out of 10. the other point lost on Rob Schneider. Love you Schneider but.....good god man.
