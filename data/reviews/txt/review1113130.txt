This film has to be the worst zombie movie i have ever seen and i have seen heaps of them.IT starts off with people shooting the zombies with guns in a paddock and then they think they killed them all but one survived and then 14 years later they start to come back.The acting in the film is pretty bad and the zombies have very poor makeup next to none.And the zombies just walk around trying to make scary faces which are not scary but all the gory blood is good and Tom savini has a little part in the film.YOU should not waste your money on hiring this movie hire dawn of the dead to see a good zombie film.The most money i would pay to buy this film would be $3 or less over all i give this film 4 out of 10 i would give it 3 but i love zombie movies so i gave it 4
