hey guys...i must say that no matter what it is still pure entertainment. i am quite surprised with some of the people commenting on the show as like X-men and then it leads nowhere. however, i must point out the fact that it is not meant to be a show that is going to blow your minds away and if you are looking for such a show then i guess you must look elsewhere. for pure entertainment value it is money's worth! the cast is brilliant and with the characters it does get quite creative where you can also get your creative element through the show in trying to guess what might happen next and which power would pop up next! i think in that way it is quite enjoyable besides some of the characters itself.

i would also point out the fact that the show was written for 3 seasons at the beginning and i therefore didn't expect it to end like a movie full of climaxes and anti-climaxes as you must remember it is after all a series and not a very long movie.

so guys if you want pure fun and relax and have a good laugh wondering if you could be one of those characters and how cool it would be to have powers as such, then please watch it and it would not disappoint you! cheers and fun watching...waiting eagerly for the 3 series!
