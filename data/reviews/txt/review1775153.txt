Made in China is one of the more interesting documentaries I've seen this year. I saw it at the Seattle Film festival, and it was very well attended.

Nutshell: Tom Helde is born the son of YMCA missionaries in China. He spends the first 15 years there before coming over to the US, where he raises a family and lives his life with almost no attention paid to telling stories from his youth. Tom's son John, in an attempt to get to know his father better, decides that this would make an interesting documentary (it does) and proceeds to interview his father and many other Americans who grew up in China before WWII. A planned visit with his father to China to explore Tom's youth does not go as planned due to the ravages of time and China's accelerating economic growth.

I was charmed by this film. It's a story about the tenuous bonds of family history told within the exploration of the intersection of American and Chinese cultures. The contrast between pre war China and the light speed growth now experienced is fascinating.

This is a very informative and touching film. It's especially important to see as US and Chinese economic interests seem to be conflicting more and more.
