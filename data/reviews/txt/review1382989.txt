I loved this movie! The cast was exceptionally great. I strongly encourage you to see this movie. The movie's special effects really added a lot of excitement to the movie. The plot is a very good subject that has not been featured often before in movies. I think the movie was very well edited and written. The cast and crew put a ton of effort into making the movie which you can see when you watch it. Bridget (Taylor bright) is the daredevil of the movie and Mara (Claire Richardson) is the safe sided innocent one. When Bridget steals from a store, the two have no idea what is just around the corner for them. I thought it was a very unique plot that will be enjoyed. I haven't seen many short films that a liked this much! Everyone should enjoy this and want to watch it over and over again. Who knew someone could make a short film this good. Take my advice and watch this movie. You won't regret it! Remember- YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!
