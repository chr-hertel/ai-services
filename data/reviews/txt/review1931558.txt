Okay, like so many other reviewers said, imagine "The Fugitive" + Hitchcock in France, add some Polanski, a pinch of "Spoorloos" and you get this.

This movie is very enjoyable, at least until the third act. It's a classic tale of the "wrong man" who may or may not be responsible for the disappearance of his wife. Here, instead of Harrison Ford (this also reminds me of "Frantic"), we get a younger, taller version of Dustin Hoffman - the resemblance is uncanny. But he's a good actor, and so is the ensemble cast that appears in this movie.

There's suspense, tension, action, everything. It's very rare that I applaud a movie, let alone a scene in a movie. Well, "Tell No One" has one scene (I won't say which, but it's in the middle of the film) that made me get up and do that, and when a movie makes me do this, well, that's a very good sign.

The mystery is great until you find out what really happened. The third act ruins all the fun. It's too unbelievable, too complicated, too convoluted. It seems like all the effort went in the first two acts, and the third was almost like an afterthought.

So, this is a thriller, a mystery, and an action movie. And a good one at all that. It's a shame that the 'd√©nouement' is so bad, because the movie makes big promises, but in the end, it all just fizzles out. Oh and the plot holes. Don't get me started on that.

But hey, don't listen to me. Watch this movie if you're interested - I loved it up until the ending, so who knows, you might like it, and it's a well-made effort. But I'm sticking to Hitch.

6/10
