Right after it was over I could not believe but that was the greatest movie I ever seen! Brandon Lee's final movie was truly and huge hit, and his acting really touched my heart (corny, but true). The story is particularly for teen Goths--as a favorite I say, so for people who don't like strong violence I suggest to keep away cause this movie is pretty scary, although I found it very dramatic. There really are some sad scenes that really put the viewer away from the killing-action, and I have to say the soundtrack is super, I had to buy it for myself, songs like from the Cure and Nine Inch Nails. But as i said a little earlier, I would recommend this movie to viewers who just want o see a good movie, loves Gothic and horror-action type films(like let's say Batman), then this movie is for you. But whoever, the movie really let me down a bit at the end, and just to say this was Brandon Lee's final movie. Rest in peace but check it out first.
