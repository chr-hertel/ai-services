Couldn't help but reflect that this is a film with a Rodney Collin like premise where "1 unit of positiveness reflects 100 fold, 1 unit of negativeness reflects 1000 fold ... when we turn negativeness into positiveness the result is 2000 fold" ---- really timely in the underbelly of today's world of domestic and international violence ---so this film doesn't immediately engage and struggles to keep you, as is the case with many ensemble pieces, YET the skill of the filmmaker keeps you hanging around --- the killer pace, the gritty angles, harsh locations --- and then 1/3 into the film you realize you're liking the characters and their ultra heavy matter. And it makes sense and it's not so coincidental they've collided with one another .... and how refreshing when loyalty and unconditional love burst up through the thick crust of life --- and the mirror does reflect light.
