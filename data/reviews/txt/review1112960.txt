Unexpectebly interesting and clever story.

It is in principle Alice in the Wonderland, it is Journey to There and Back Again also, it is about free decision and some events which seem to be the destiny. It is about changing something which seems to be unchangeable - changing the inner destiny. Change, what you can change and in the first place - what you want to change - that all with respect to another people wishes. And if we are talking about wishes - this movie is about the most important question of all - what I wish (what I really want to do, what I want to be). So, the most important thing and the first step of all steps from now, no matter when this NOW I realize, is to Wish, exactly what I Wish. This message is so simple, but so invisible for the most people.

What interests me is, if especially Americans understand, what "city of drugs" and "city of lawyers" are and why these two cities lie on the Interstate 60?

I give 10, because of theme, script, and acting of some actors, especially G. Oldman.
