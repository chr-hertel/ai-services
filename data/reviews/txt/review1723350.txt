One of my favourite movies, (I've just watched it again this evening)-this is such a fun, tongue in cheek, and, at times, total "piss take" that should just be enjoyed for what it is-the more I see it the better it gets. Wasn't sure if I liked the Chris Tucker role on first viewing but now realise his comic element is a perfect balance for the sometimes serious subject. This movie has it all: comedy, sci-fi, suspense, thrills, adventure, drama, special effects and, most importantly, romance. The music was so good, (particularly 'The Diva') I bought the CD. A must see movie for anyone who doesn't take life too seriously-don't watch if you like 'believable' movies.
