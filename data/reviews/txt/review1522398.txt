Behind Enemy Lines is about a navy seal team that parachutes into North Korea to take out a nucyeller missile that can reach the USA. The whole mission is handled terribly by the team as they make mistake after mistake. The get caught and are saved by South Korean spies. Reminds me of the ill fated attempt to save the Iran hostages in 80, the helicopters had nothing to keep the sand out of the engines. The acting was passable, but it seemed rushed and hollow. It seemed to be taken from actual events and implied that this mission actually took place and was covered up by the Koreas and the USA. If you want to see some violence and lots of shooting, this is for you.
