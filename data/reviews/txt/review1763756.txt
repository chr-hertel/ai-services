Spelling productions did not make Love, American Style. They took the basic concept of it, added places for the love to happen (on a Princess Cruise ship & in ports of call), a regular crew, & mass produced 10 years of the Love Boat. Part of the reason it worked was the ship as you could dream of being on a cruise & never leave your living room.

Each episode usually had 2 or three plot lines with different guests involved. Each one would involve the crew interacting with the guests. Each one would usually have a happy ending. Sometimes, episodes would even go 2 hours. Princess Cruises definitely got a lot of valuable promo from this series.

Like Love American Style, the love aspect would get by with a wink, a grin, & some subtle hints of the feelings that were really going on. The crew was a pretty talented ensemble. Gavin McCloud as your Captain became more of less the star of the show. Bernie Kopell as the ships playboy Doctor became a key factor a lot of times. Lauren Tewes was the supposed hot cruise director. Then there was Gopher & the bartender always around either when you need them or not around when you need them.

The guest stars would read like a whose who of 1960's & 70's actors & actresses. It was amazing how many folks would get drawn on board this ship. Realism, this show has little. Bubble gum for the brain, that is where this show comes from. "Come Aboard, We're Expecting you!"
