One of my favorite ABC Afterschool Specials of all time, there is so much that makes this production sparkle. The wonderful story by Stephen H. Foreman does something that was very rare at this time: it made a television magical (whatever happened to this writer?). Butterfly McQueen is a delight to watch (and listen to!) in a role that she was made for. As a kid, I identified a lot with the character of Joanna Peabody, and marveled at the idea of having those seven wishes -- this episode stuck with me for months.

This is a production that Rod Serling would have been proud of, with both fantastic/supernatural elements and a very important moral message, all presented in a fun, entertaining way. Why "The Seven Wishes of Joanna Peabody" hasn't become a classic on TV and shown regularly, I just don't understand.
