The Crow the City of angels First off I would like to say all the people who said this movie is bad should go and try to make a better movie because in my view this movie was fine just as good as the first crow or better just because this movie is not by today's standards (action pack) doesn't mean it's a bad movie. I prefer a movie with some action and a lot more story telling I enjoyed this movie based on these facts the plot was good and presented a strong emotion to it between a farther and his son The acting was perfect Vincent Perez gave a great look to the crow his eyes are so deep and filled in sadness in this movie The movie is in a great location really giving L.A. a deep feel to it and I still don't see why people say this movie bad this movie by no means made me feel vile This movie is a work of art an 8 out of 10
