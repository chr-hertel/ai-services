I like thought proving movies, but I just didn't get it. The philosophical concept was interesting, and it is that that led me to enjoy the first 5 minutes of the movie. But, after the initial concept was revealed 5 minutes into the movie, I found the rest of the move to be completely boring. It amazes me that so many people rated this movie highly. I truly don't see the entertainment value in the movie that the others reviewers have seen in it (it is currently rated a 7.7, and that blows me away). Being engaged in an interactive philosophical conversation on what occurs in one's afterlife is entertaining, as is watching a GOOD movie on afterlife such as "the sixth sense". But thhis movie, Afterlife, is just plain slow and boring.
