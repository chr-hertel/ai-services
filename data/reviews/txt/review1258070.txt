While we have usually seen an image of Colombia as the country where cocaine reigns supreme. "Maria Full of Grace" shows something slightly different. While drugs do play a role, we get to see people's daily lives and see that individuals do try to live normal lives in spite of the country's drug wars. The plot has pregnant 17-year-old Maria Alvarez (Catalina Sandino Moreno) agreeing to be a "mule", carrying drug pellets in her stomach. She does this, but things don't work out quite as anyone expects.

I'm sure that most people in Colombia are not dealing drugs; the revolutionary groups and the government have been fighting each other since 1964, and both sides target the common citizens. But like I said, this movie shows the lives of the common people in Colombia. And not that this is related, but Catalina Sandino Moreno is really pretty.
