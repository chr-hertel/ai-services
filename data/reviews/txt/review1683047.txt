this movie is one of the most awesome achievements in cinema history! awesome action sequences,good actors and a perfect director makes my all time top 20. i was not a fan of transformers before i saw this movie, i haven't seen the old animated series. i just knew that it wouldn't die out, so it had to be something special. the robot vs robot action sequences are just breathtaking, i remember thinking to my self in the theater... "wow what the hell, how did they do that?" i cant wait for a DVD release of this film, I'm going to watch it again and again and again. because its that kind of movie. in my opinion this is the greatest thing to hit the screen since the original matrix! and the robots and human interacting is just so believable and great made! this the kind of movie james cameron could make!

This movie is a must for any movie fan!
