Enjoyable, but very flawed.

Too many wasted characters. Jar Jar Binks added then ditched when he realised everyone hated him. 

What was the point of having Chewbacca in it - ah! I know, so George Lucas can tell all his fans that "Chewy's in it."

C3-PO, a waste of time - should never have been in the first two and should have just been added at the end of the third one. Vader screaming "Nooooo!!" at the end. Reminds me of Seymour Skinner off the Simpsons screaming "Nooooo!!" when Bart Simpson inflates a hot air balloon of him and releases it.

Too many light-sabre battles. Probably because George was desperate to have them in. In the IV, V, VI films there was around one battle per film.

Too many characters. No one is likable in any of the I, II, III films.

Also the Prime Minister of Utapau. When he whispered that the "Clone Army was here." I can't tell if he was lying or not. very ambiguous.

Obi-Wan's lizard had something stuck in it's throat.

Visuals are very good, but more original ships should have been in it instead of re-designed ones. There isn't a single ship in the I, II, III same as the ones in the later ones. Obi-Wan and co should have been in Tie Fighters as the Empire simply replaced the Republic.

George's problem is that there's too many people round him saying "yes, George, Jar Jar, fantastic idea.." get my point.
