This is one of the worst movies I have ever had to endure. I was so shocked to see a fellow human rate this 10/10. Even a as a pure revenge film this sucks, big time.

Furthermore,The Punisher franchise has been wasted, The Punisher is supposed to be a dark, tortured, anti- hero of titanic proportions, power drilling peoples heads and sawing of their hands etc. The 'actor' whose name I won't mention, does a truly pathetic job of putting this across. There's no overall menace to any of the films 'charachters' bar, maybe John Travaltas.

The script itself was terrible, the style of the whole film was bland and utterly forgettable, this reminds me of an early '90's straight to video release and it's only possible use, would be to film students wanting to observe 'how most certainly not to do it'. As for the comment from another member stating 'one of the best films of 2004', dear me, you sir/maddam are a total and utter, and lets not make a mistake I feel bad for you, a total gimp, this really is one of the worst films of all time,it might have got a 5 back in the day of Rambo but compared to Sin City and The Island this is utter crap.
