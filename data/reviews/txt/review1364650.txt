Quite possibly the best children's BBC production to date. 

WW2 based drama from a kids perspective i.e. what did they get up to while Daddy was out fighting Hitler? 

Don't remember much other than Chas McGill having red hair and Rudi "Where go Now?" - and of course the machine gun they found. 

Really must get hold of a copy from the BBC shop.

Other greats include - The December Rose, Moonfleet, The Secret Garden, The Box of Delights

The latter being the best Christmas themed children's TV drama the BBC have ever produced and never been bettered!
