This movie, while hardly believable, is great entertainment--thanks to both a super script and excellent performances all around. About the only complaint about it is that SOME of the kids look old enough to be teachers themselves! Vic Morrow, the baddest of the bad kids, was 26! Sidney Poitier, the smart kid with a future, was 28! And Jameel Farah (later renamed "Jamie Farr"), as the "slow kid", was practically a baby at 21! Glenn Ford plays a tough but decent teacher sent to teach in a tough school (it sure looks tame by modern standards). His idealism slowly begins to vanish, as he is confronted with needing to wrest control from the thugs. All this boils down to one of the most dramatic conclusions you'll ever see in film.

In addition to Ford, the other teachers are a wonderful representation of various types of teachers--the tough "Nazi-type", the ones who've given up hope and the amazingly idealistic (such as Richard Kiley).

An impressive, though slightly dated film with a cool soundtrack featuring Bill Haley and the Comets. In its day, this was quite the controversial movie with its rock music and rebellion.
