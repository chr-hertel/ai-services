This movie just sucks!. At least I didn't have to pay to rent it but I do have to pay for the electricity to watch the DVD, so I wasted that money. To think, I almost rented something else but then thought it might be a good zombie movie. This movie makes Shaun of the Dead look like a masterpiece. By the way, that movie had more f words than this piece of crud. I didn't even know what the movie was about until I read the review after I watched the movie. This must have been a fifth grader's school project. I am hoping that if I ever come across a zombie that he doesn't run, talk or carry sharp implements. I just can't get over how much this movie sucks. Guess I'll just watch Dawn of the Dead for the millionth time.
