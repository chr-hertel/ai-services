Sequels that retain the core original cast have a potential for, if not better than, as good as. This film was neither.

High School Musical 2 was bad piece of work. The sequel to a brilliant first film is a story already told in that first film. Creativity swept into a black whole. Or under the viewer's rug. The movie appeared to begin with a plot but the storytellers wandered away from it. Attention to the story was sacrificed to fit in an extra song or two. An extra hat.

The soundtrack did not match the heat level reached and set in the original film. The song-writing was good. The singers fine. Upbeat. Performing with passion. But the bond between a song and a scene -the one that makes music memorable- is missing. The choreographed dancing was as brilliant as in the first film. Lot's of energy. Lot's of talent with the cast and crew in that area. For what they had to work with, the acting was fine. Simply no fireworks.

The musical mixing near the film's end was shameful. A mess. And then the story was over. On a stage. And then it wasn't. A horrible idea to add a bad second ending.

High School Musical 1 was collectible. High School Musical 2 was forgettable.
