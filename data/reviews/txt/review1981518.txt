This movie was propaganda trash. All the actors are democrats (shocking) and it was a cowardly attack against our brave soldiers. This movie made me sick. Tommy Lee Jones is a disgrace. Susan Sarandon is sickening. If I saw them in person, I'd spit on them for spitting on our soldiers by implying they are all messed up on drugs and experience. Anti-American scum. I think anyone who was in this film should think twice about being in the United States and move to a country, like Iraq, since they obviously think values in that country are better than ours. This movie was absolutely dire and shocking and I can't believe anyone who claims to be American is happy that this has been shown around the world and condones how it depicts our brave soldiers. It made me irate.
