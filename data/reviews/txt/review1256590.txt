i've seen this movie 2 months ago and it really touched me, i never thought i could feel sorry for a murderer and even cry for one but i did- i cried the very evening i saw the film, and the next day when i told my mum about it, and i still cry when i think about it - to me her life, and what she's been through and the ending have been so cruel and seemed to me so unjust, i saw her not as a criminal, as a monster - i saw her as a victim - being the victim of rapes in her childhood, the victim of poverty, the victim of reckless and ignorant minds, the victim of society, one of life's victims, and whenever i see cases like this one i wonder if our world has any chance left to salvation - i saw last night on discovery a documentary on another serial killer - he was called the night stalker - for that guy i didn't feel sorry - i would have beaten him to death myself if i could - he has been sentenced to death in the gas chamber - and since 1985 - i think - he is still waiting for his execution - he even has a fan club - incredible but true - what kind of sick stupid women would admire such a MONSTER - he is a monster-? i would like to know...and he married one of his fans!!!! and that man is still alive, he raped, killed with cold blood innocent people and he is still alive!!! I must say life has a grotesque irony sometimes!...Returning to Aileen I believe she didn't kill men because she was a pure blood killer, because she liked to kill, but because she was seeking love - which she could get by providing Selby money, whatever she needed..., i think Selby was superficial and selfish - in the end she "sold" Aileen to the police having no remorse...I believe Aileen did not realize what she was doing until it was too late...I believe she was a victim, she was defenseless, vulnerable...this movie really made me think more about justice, prejudice, love, tragedies...
