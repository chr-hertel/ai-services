I think the real-life Amber Frey is a hero for having the guts to tell the truth and give testimony that helped convict Scott Peterson. However, this movie was nothing compared to the drama that unfolded on Court TV before and during the trial. Janel Moloney was perfect casting, but she is a bland actress portraying a bland character. Although it was good to see the scenes with her daughter and saddening to be reminded of how she was portrayed by the media, the movie was rather formulaic. Nathan Anderson was a chillingly lookalike Scott Peterson. The actress playing Sharon Rocha was touching. My wife fell asleep during the movie. I watched it until the end, and wished I had gone to sleep as well.
