I read the comments about this movie and thought it would be a great change of pace...this was NOT the case. This is a made for cable TV movie all the way. I think they could of done a better job on the monster as well considering other OLDER movies such as "Pumpkinhead" had WAY better animatronics and is almost 20 years old. To me, this was a movie that had a lot more potential than it lived up too. A strong cast where the most popular recognizable names had a few minutes of screen time. The gore was good..and seemed well done, however it seemed complementary in order to appeal to a certain genre of horror fans while suppling a good jump periodically when not expected. The acting was over done by the main characters and had a feel of pushing the character instead of the audience getting lost in the character which ultimately leads to you realize you're watching someone act and not become the character. Some of the props seemed staged and placed for effect instead of something like "The Decent" where it felt real and part of the landscape. I wish I could of given this a higher rating, but overall I was left feeling cheated and a Friday was wasted on a 2am straight to video movie where I called the ending half way into it and it lived up to everything I thought it wouldn't be. I'd say, if you want to laugh at a badly done movie with potential and your DVD library is exhausted, put it in with some popcorn and peyote and you'd have a good time. Otherwise, I'd say pass on it. I do see potential in the director however, so I hope he get's a bigger budget and a better sense of what not to do. Again, suspiciously high ratings by some users.
