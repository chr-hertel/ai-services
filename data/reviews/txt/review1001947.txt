Wow. Anyone who thinks that this was a better movie than Baby Geniuses 2 obviously has never had to suffer through this sad 74 minute excuse for a feature film. I would have to say that I would rather watch an hour and a half of Public Access TV or even static than have to torture myself by viewing Manos again. If the government took suspected terrorists and made them watch this video until they gave up information, we wouldn't even have to interrogate them! The acting was terrible, there was no comprehensible plot and machinery at a construction site sounds better than its soundtrack. If you for whatever reason MUST watch this movie, then do yourself a favor and watch the MST3k version. And one more thing: "Manos" means "hand in Spanish, making the translated title "Hand: The Hands of Fate."

Drama (wait, there was drama in this movie?) Movie Score (1/10) Overall Movie Score (1/10) Not Recommended to anyone who does not want to kill off their brain cells
