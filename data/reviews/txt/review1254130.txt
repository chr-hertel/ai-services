I met Ruthie Henshall in December 2005 after i saw her in Woman In White. Ruthie is the actress who played Fantine in the 10th Anniversary Concert of Les Miserables. I met her, got her autograph, got my picture taken with her and got a shot of me and her together on my video camera....and she is SO nice!!!! Ruthie is an amazing woman who has SO much talent. She is the best actress/singer/dancer in the world, next to Catherine Zeta-Jones!!!! And she's SO pretty.....did anyone see her on Loose Woman in September and when she played Nancy in the celebration of Oliver on Boxing Day???? How good was she!!!! "Now life has KILLED the dream, I dreamed!" - Fantine, Les Miserables.
