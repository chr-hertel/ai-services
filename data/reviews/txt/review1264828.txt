This film is old fashioned and romantic in the best possible way. It could be one of the best date movies ever made. Although you may find that your girlfriend has started to fantasise over Day Lewis, but that's OK you've probably started to fantasise over him too, Oh! and Madeline Stowe. The score contains possibly one of the best theme's in cinema history. The photography is stunning as is the action. Day Lewis gives his customary brilliant performance. Plus the movie manages to depict native Americans in a way that does not seem like a pathetic apology (see: dances with wolves) or remotely patronising in a "my, they're so mystical and at one with nature" kind of way that most films seem to fall into. Also the last ten minuets are utterly brilliant! 

In short a fun, stirring, romantic, sexy and exciting movie!
