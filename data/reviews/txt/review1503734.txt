yeah it's true i've seen this movie first day first show. And it's amazing though it lacks enough on some VFX n editing part but rest of the things are fine. Though VFX are done by red chillies there's a fragrance of Illusion in the movie. Colour Grading n Cinematography is superb and yeah the costumes are ultimate. Going properly with the theme but sometimes it looks so over but the time you'll take to think about that you'll be taken on a new ride. So everything goes fine and at the end of the movie you'll yourself feel that this is the REAL DON. who looks nice saying those lines that ITS NOT DIFFICULT TO CATCH DON... ITS IMPOSSIBLE. yeah i think they could've shown a much bigger gang of DON but this is my personnel thinking.. May be farhan had something better in his mind. The way Taran Adarsh has criticized the movie shows how much mental level he has. The music is ROCKING. SEL has done a great job accept yeh mera dil... Background score is also ultimate. Great movie worth a watch.
