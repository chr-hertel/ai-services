I watched this low budget Australian movie just because of Emily Blunt but in the end it turned out to be a great film. Blunt, Neill and Sarandon all play their roles excellently and it's a shame that this movie is not available for wider audience. Unpredictable plot without cheap Hollywood tricks and scenes makes this film a hidden gem. All actors do they work really well and you can't just shut down in the end, because it's so surprising. This thriller is really thrilling and doesn't use any of clich√©s which are so common for this genre. Instead of it Irresistible uses original approaches and is full of beautiful images and realistic behavior of main characters. It's certainly worth-seeing.
