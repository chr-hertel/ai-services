this is one of the best comedy movies i have seen in years and it was somehow thought of as bad by most critics. well i have a message to the so called "prodesional critics" you have no taste in what is good and what is bad and if you think this movie is bad, then you should seriously consider another line of work, because obviously you aren't cut out to be a critic how can a movie with bill Murray, Angelica Houston, Jeff Goldbloom, and Owen Wilson be bad, especially when it is written and directed by Wes Anderson. the special effects were probably the most ill favored by critics, but what they failed to realize is that they intenionally looked over the top to create a more surreal experience
