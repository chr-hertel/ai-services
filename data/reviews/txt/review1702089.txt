Film is paced well in the beginning and the characters are interesting and engaging. But with the introduction of the ex-con character (Paddy Constantine)and the ultra-Nationalistic rhetoric that is neither fully explained in its historical context nor developed within the characters lives in the narrative, the film falls flat...there is no pay-off in the end. A fight for Nationalism, it seems, is NOT the impetus for the ex-con's aggression. In fact, the film maker doesn't fully develop the characters to the point that the skinhead movement--at least in their lives--makes any sense at all.

The film did nothing to explain the 80s skinheads, 80s Nationalism, or England.
