I had the privilege of watching this film three times in theaters and I have to say that it is a stunning achievement in movie making.

I can understand people's distaste for Jim Carrey, since he becomes the central character (sharing the spotlight with the very talented child cast) where he should merely remain a villain.

The adaptation to the books is quite tight, keeping in mind that it is a combination of three of the books, not just one. That being said and all acting aside, this movie is just mind blowing.

The technique used to capture the surreal surroundings the Baudelaire orphans travel through is one that should be marked and used again. The art designers went back to the days of old(film-making) where painted backdrops, elaborate sets and extensive make-up drove the point.

An excellent example of what I mean is the scene where the children are left on the train tracks and Count Olaf goes into a store to wait until the kids have been run over. The entire surrounding in the scene, the corn fields, train tracks, skyline, etc. is a painted backdrop. It is simply unbelievable.

Another example of what I mean is Count Olaf's house, where the Baudelaire orphans are first sent to live. It is Gothic, run down, and perfect.

Besides the Oscar this movie received for make-up, Rick Heinrichs and Cheryl Carasik truly deserved to win their nomination for best art direction. This aspect is definitely the one that stands out among all others...

The music was damned good as well...
