This is one of Ron Howard's triumphs, and one of the best movies about family relationships.

It's got a dream cast and reads like a who's who of popular 80's actors-Steve Martin, Mary Steenburgen, Keanu Reeves,Dianne Wiest, Martha Plimpton, Tom Hulce, Harley Kozak, Rick Moranis-and the terrific Jason Robards and an outstanding (albeit young) Joaquin Phoenix. All give phenomenal performances that were tailor made for them. Who else but Steve Martin could be Cowboy Gil? And who but Dianne Wiest could portray a tough as nails, but sweetly feminine single mother? And who else but Keanu Reeves and Martha Plimpton could have been the Romeo and Juliet wannabes Todd and Julie? Some of the situations in the film could seem far-fetched, but the likability of the cast is so immense that you just have to take it as it comes. They make the script work, and Ron Howard's direction is superb.

I have seen this movie several times through the years, and it never gets old, it just gets better. This is absolutely one to own!
