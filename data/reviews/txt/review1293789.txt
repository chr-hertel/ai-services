This film is a very low budget account of a rather hackneyed ghost story. The special effects are primitive, the acting is generally amateurish and there are quite a few holes in the plot. The story has elements of soap opera and dialog appropriate to a soap opera is incongruously inserted into some of the action scenes. Frankly, I find it difficult to imagine a viewer effecting a suspension of disbelief thorough enough to take this story seriously. However, although it is clearly not meant to be outright parody, its clumsiness achieves a certain unintended humour at times. For all my dismay at its shortcomings, I have to say it held my interest, although it definitely wouldn't bear a second viewing well.
