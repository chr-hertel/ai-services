It's very difficult to understand and/or appreciate a short such as this one when its taken out of context. A man is shown placing a casket on the ground and then another man is placed with his back against a nearby wall. He is given his last rites and then summarily shot by a firing squad.

What makes the whole thing rather surreal is that the guy clutches his chest with one hand and quite dramatically lurches his other hand outward. It's like one of those truly awful death scenes that is still parodied to this day. It ruins any chance of generating anything but a snicker from the viewing audience.
