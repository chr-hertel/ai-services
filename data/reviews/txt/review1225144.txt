I knew very little about Johnny Cash before seeing this movie but I'm really glad I invested the time to see it.

Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon do a great job portraying these complicated, talented artists and their relationship from the early days of their careers. Joaquin had a tougher role but he came through beautifully in expressing the angst and struggle in JC's life.

The actors did a very credible job singing and the drama around their relationship was interesting and poignant.

JC was a brilliant songwriter and singer who took some wrong paths on his road to fame and somehow lived to tell about it. The glimpses of his past give us an indication of where his dark side came from and yet he never gives up.

I really enjoyed this movie and I think you will too!
