I saw the film in Calcutta in 1970 at the New Empire theatre with my family. I remember that the film ran to packed audiences for at least a year. All the members of my family found the suspense thriller to be extremely riveting.

A young couple (Giuliano Gemma as Giulio and Rosemary Dexter as Laetitia) visits an island where they are befriended by an elderly couple (Gunnar Bjornstrand as Prof Gunnar Lindmark and Bibi Andersson as Margit Lindmark). On more than one occasion Prof Lindmark secretly watches Giulio and Laetitia making love on the beach. But why does he do that? Is he a sexual pervert? Does he have a voyeuristic interest in their lives? Or is he feeling jealous as he is impotent? All I can say is that the climax will leave you in a state of shock and you will keep thinking as to why some of the characters acted the way they did. I still remember my family members talking about the film and its ending after we had watched it. Unfortunately, I have never been able to watch it again.

Beautifully directed by Floresto Vancini on picturesque locales, "Blow Hot Blow Cold" will keep you on the edge of your seat right till the very last minute.
