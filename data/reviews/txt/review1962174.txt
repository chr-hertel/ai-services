It's hard to sit through this miserable MGM short wherein THE THREE STOOGES go through their paces with TED HEALY acting as a sort of master of ceremonies in an act that falls flat before the first two minutes are over.

At least the Stooges get into their slapstick routine of face slapping nonsense with their usual aplomb, but Healy is neither charismatic as a performer nor much of a singer, given the songs he attempts to sing here.

The only bit of inspiration comes from the dance routines that a bevy of chorus girls do, twirling propellers around and photographed from above in Busby Berkeley manner for some eye catching formations simulating planes.

This is the kind of act that must have killed vaudeville. I found myself impatiently waiting for the twenty minute short to conclude. Not soon enough for me. Agonizingly bad stuff, dated and cornball from start to finish and a bit crude in the style of humor.
