Very fun, tho' the voice-overs are a bit much at times... and the music/slow-mo/stop-mo action stuff is a bit kitsch (probably the look they were going for).

Def. think Donovan's personality comes through in his performance -- seems like he is having TONS O' FUN with the part... (who wouldn't? It's a dream role)... but he DOES come across as a bit stiff at times... can't tell if that's the writing or his take on the character. Funny... you can hear his Boston accent come thru a lot... but it adds some charm (assuming you like Boston accents!!) Bruce Campbell is perfectly cast... will be fun to see their partnership evolve over the episodes... Not sure about Anwar as Fiona... can't decide if it's the role (and how desperate she seems to be to get back with Michael) or the actress in the role...

I do enjoy the dialog (VERY funny at times - ex: the backseat of the Mercedes)... and the speed of delivery... makes it fun to watch and the time fly... so KUDOS to the writers... 

Will say this... I'm probably not in the demographic for their audience (am over 40) but can appreciate that the leads are all older... would NEVER believe that Donovan is 39. No way. He is Miami Spicy.
