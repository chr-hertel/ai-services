There is Hollywood and there are the independents. The storyline is always the same, some vampire has to be killed. In Underworld it's the same, but that one contained a lot of CGI and had a lot of money. But the fact that CGI doesn't work makes it sometimes boring although it is a good movie. Bloodrayne also has some real 'declined' good actors. The storyline is as always the same but what makes this movie hateful or adorable is the amount of gore in it. And as I watched closely I noticed that Olaf Ittenbach was involved. The master of gore himself. Some killings or slaughterings are not for the squeamish and that's the main reason that people are hating this flick. But if you love vampires and gore than your in for a good flick, I just can't believe that it has a 2,4 on the scale. That was also one of the reasons that I never watched it earlier but it was one of those days that you feel you have to give it a try. I was not disappointed. It has an open end, and there is now Bloodrayne 2 available. Let's hope the gore stays intact. It's a one of his kind to see really good and well known (Ben Kingsley, Udo Kier) actors in this nice flick. So be it.
