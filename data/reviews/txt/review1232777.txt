Being a British subject, I am rather predisposed to being rather cynical when it comes to Hollywood's tales of World War 2 (my grandpa always told me it was rather different).

Perhaps it is the BBC investment in the production, perhaps it is the British actors involved, or more probably it is a product of thoughtful and detailed investigation, but this series cuts through the usual glitzy nostalgia and pretty much tells you as it is.

The lack of a single character in the story, means that the bigger picture is the real star, and the series is all the better for it.

Humour, action and history, well worth a watch.
