Finally Stephen Dorff gets a good role in a good movie and proves he has serious actor chops. Congratulations to him for hopefully firing his old manager and getting someone who can really represent his talent. Val Kilmer also shines bright, we knew he could act already but his manager seemed to sign him up for some real talent hiding turkeys so congratulations to Val too for getting it so very very right for this movie.

This movie is powerful and compelling, its a dark story, violent and tough, but director/writer Ric Roman Waugh has painted it richly with many shades, characters are believable, and have motivation for their actions, and there are consequences.

This is a well thought out well acted and well realized story made all the more striking because it makes sense. The bad guys are bad, but they're bad for a reason, and in any other movie Waugh wouldn't have to give them that depth of character, but it is to his writing credit he does and to his directing credit that his cast render those details so accurately and believably.

Also of note Harold Perrineau steps away from his role in Lost and paints another dark character of conflicted emotions, an Marisol Nichols does more than look pretty in her role as torn wife trapped in Dorff's spiraling waking nightmare situation.

In fact every character and actor does a top job in this movie. The hardened criminals are mostly real ex cons and do a good job of scaring the sh!ts out of you.

Top work everyone.
