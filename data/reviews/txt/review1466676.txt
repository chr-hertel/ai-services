After so much good review and the relatively high critics on this movie, I really thought it is going to be something like the first or the second in the Police Story Series, but unfortunately this is not so. The plot and character of Jackie's movies rarely were criterion for judging them. Most of his movies are funny. Some of them were serious action movies. The director of 'New Police Story' hasn't decided which side to take, and has mixed both humor and tragic to it.

The movie starts tragically, with Jackie Chan as a Chief Police Officer loosing his team. This tragic atmosphere supposedly bears throughout the movie abundant with idiotic jokes not fitting this atmosphere. Sometimes it's like laughing at the funeral.

Although the stunts are great as always, and Jacky delivers some good moments, they are blended with exaggerated, unnecessary visual effects. The fight choreography is typical and doesn't catch the eye more than usual.

The movie being over two hours long exhibit with a little of fight scenes, and stunt scenes saturated with nonsense talk that clearly spoils the movie.
