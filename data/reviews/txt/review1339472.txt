This really is quite an entertaining romp. The cast is 'all-star' from a British perspective and generally put to good use. It's not laugh out loud funny but it is fun. The general idea of bumping off those who've upset you in life when you know you're going to die is a nice one. It got me thinking about my 'list' anyhow! I guess as a Micael Winner film it could be seen as a kind of comedy 'Death Wish'!. Oliver Reed is particularly good fun as a world-weary assassin. Chris Rea in the lead role is not at all bad in a down-beat kind of way and it's a mild surprise that we've not seen him in anything else since (at least I haven't). I don't think you'd be disappointed if you see this film.
