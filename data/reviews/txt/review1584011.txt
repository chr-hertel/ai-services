Death Cab for Cutie's album 'Plans' opened up to some negative press. Not due to the content, no...but because Death Cab had signed onto Atlantic records, and they had 'sold-out'. Well, let me be the first to tell you this is not a 'sell-out' work. It is a low budget, fascinating collection of thirteen short films. It is one of the best music interpretations I have ever come by. All of the videos do not stick so close to the song that it is cheesy, but none of them are so abstract and odd that you have to scratch your head, and think: "What the hell were they thinking?"

An A+ effort. RECOMMENDED VIDEOS: Marching Bands of Manhattan, Summer Skin, Different Names for the Same Thing, Jealousy Rides With Me, Talking Like Turnstiles
