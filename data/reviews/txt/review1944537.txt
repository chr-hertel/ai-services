A small town is slowly disappearing under a flood of water. Armoured car guard Slater and his partner find themselves in dangerous waters when a gang of thieves, led by Freeman, set about to steal the money. They kill Slater's partner and now he's on the run with the money in a town that's that's about to be completely flooded.

A pedestrian script and cardboard characters nearly sink this one. There's no real story here to speak of, just one chase after another and the excellent cast can't do much with these clich√©d ridden and uninteresting characters.

But spectacular production values and effects make this suspense yarn more than worth your while. The setting here is beyond amazing and extremely well done and some of the action set pieces are really great. Plus that music score is awesome.

With more interesting characters and a (much) better script (loved that Springsteen quote, though) this would have been a bona fide classic.
