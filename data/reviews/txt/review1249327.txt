The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was way too fast paced and movie did not really get deep into minds of main characters. Movie did not explain characters' reactions or decisions very well, hence not answering the question 'why?'. It is a huge mistake especially in this case, when there really are the right answers: in the book. Of course it is good to give the viewer a chance to think by him/herself, but when this is done and characters for first time act unrealistically or dramatically other way than the viewer thought they would do, movie becomes something that viewer considers... stupid.

As a whole, it was not a bad movie. It only was too quick one. Main actors performed well.

Animation was nice, though Aslan sometimes looked more like a cat from Pixar movie, rather than being a photo-realistic lion.
