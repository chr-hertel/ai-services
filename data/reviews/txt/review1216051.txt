Why isn't Dick Enberg given credit for his role as the main play-by-play announcer? A prequel or sequel would be OK. The problem with that is, the film world is littered with post-apocalyptic films and most are bad. Like Death Race 2000, for ex. Besides, John Houseman is dead. His role is important in this movie, so it would be important in a prequel or sequel. Or you can just watch Robocop, Demplition Man and THX 1138 for more futuristic movies with fascist/communist visions. There is talk of a new Terminator trilogy; where does it end? And all you have to do is watch a Nascar race, to see real life similarities, what with constant thanking of sponsors. Plus Nike and other companies in College sports, etc.
