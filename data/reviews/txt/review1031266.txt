I gave The Secret of NIMH a 10 in the ratings because it was an awesome movie and should be more well known. This is my favorite movie of all time, and its almost never on TV. A movie of this great magnitude should be on TV more often than two years, which is the longest time I've seen it not be on TV. Its great to know that there are others who love this movie also, and i know i would love to see a NIMH III. Though some might say a NIMH III want made, i know that its out there somewhere. But no sequel will ever top the animation, the story and just the sheer brilliance of the first movie, which is what makes it my all time favorite movie. And i hope its yours too. Viva la Secret of NIMH!!!!!-timmy82
