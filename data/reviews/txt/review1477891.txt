While the arrival of 'talkies' didn't create screen icons, they did expand what we've come to expect from movies - an expansion that's never stopped.

So here we have a movie that's all about men who worship an idol (Garbo), who herself plays a worshipper(Mata) of an idol (Siva), and 'outside the movie', we are expected to worship Garbo. It had tremendous possibilities, but alas, never quite achieved liftoff, due to the entanglements of dialog-driven plot and the insistence on panting close-up shots.

By itself, this combination of stagy, two-dimensional filming and hard-breathing acting is nugatory, obsolete. But perhaps it's worth a look to appreciate the alto-voiced vamp, the model for Bancroft's Anna Bronski in "To Be or Not To Be" and Kahn's Lili von Shtupp from "Blazing Saddles".
