This film was first made as a silent in 1915. The 1939 version is a classic. This is the 7th time they have tried to remake this story of honor and duty and redemption and they have done a magnificent job. The battle scenes and the cinematography certainly make this film shine. A superb cast includes Wes Bentley (Ghost Riders), Heath Ledger (Brokeback Mountain, Kate Hudson, and, of course, Djimon Hounsou as the man who gets the hero across the desert.

After seven films, the story is a familiar one, but Shekhar Kapur has done a magnificent job of directing and one hopes to see more of his work in the future.
