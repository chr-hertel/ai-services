Whoever wrote the comments above must be associated with the film. This movie is abysmal - I just watched Ebert & Roeper crucify it - and they are right - special mention goes to Carmen Electra's horrendous acting- Jenny's husband directs the film - neither has any talent. This is a train-wreck that's not even fun to watch. Ugh. If the person who already reviewed the movie recommended it as a film to see at Sundance, when there are so many good films at that festival, his/her friends must hate them now. Avoid at all costs. The acting is horrible, the writing is awful, the camera work sucks - this is one of the worst movies ever! It's depressing that this got made when there are so many talented actors/writers/directors out there who can't get their films made. One hopes this will be the last time we have to see a Jenny McCarthy movie.
