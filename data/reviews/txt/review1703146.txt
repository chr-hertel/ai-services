The series has been release in a 4 hour German only version called Notturno over here in Austria on DVD. And the Film is as good as I can remember the series, maybe even better, due to the middle part being cut into various pieces into the other parts which adds a lot.

It is really a funny situation, the entire thing was a European co production with a mainly Austrian / German cast (Udo Samel to my knowledge was dubbed into the viennese accent due to being German) It was shown once, highly praised and then nothing anymore, I can remember one late night return of the series a few years ago which I unfortunately missed. Anyway, if you have the chance to watch this series, this is an absolute masterpiece of European cinema, I would rate it as high as some Tarkovskij movies and Fanny and Alexander in its importance.

Mostly overlooked, but an absolute masterpiece which should deserve more publicity.

Anyway if you understand German, then get this DVD, it is a special edition released in Austria and available currently in the stores for 10 Euros.
