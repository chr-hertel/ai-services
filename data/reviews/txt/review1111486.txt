I didn't really know much about this film when I saw it in the shop a cheap looking horror film for only a couple of pounds, and it looks so similar to they crawl that at first I thought it was the same film. Luckily this film is far better than they crawl. I guess that my expectations were rather low going into this film (which always helps) but I did like this film. It was a bit strange that I happened to watch this film straight after watching cold creek manor as certain plot stories are almost identical, but I am sure that they nest wasn't the first to come up with this it certainly preceded cold creek manor. Only thing to say is...If cockroaches and/or bugs make you feel errgh don't watch, otherwise not a bad little horror film there are much worse ways to kill an hour and a half.
