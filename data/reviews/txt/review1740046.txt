This film to me has not dated -= in fact the frightening thing is that it echoes what is happening now - from news readers smiling about commercials for the 'SUX' and then shooting to the next story about '300 deaths in central America' (pp)... We even have police officers threatening to strike in the u|k at the moment!! But the film is also so quotable and there are very strong performances - esp from Kurtwood smith "Can you fly bobby!"

The action scenes are spot on and the violent is very violent - which it should be... the other main star of this is Basil poledouris's music - it is fab and drives the films action and emotive scenes!! Rock on robo!!!
