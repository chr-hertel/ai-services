Heard a lot of negative comments, but the trailer convinced me to at least check it out. I was pleasantly surprised. A nice, cute film with some very nice moments. Well written/acted/directed/produced - the only trouble for me is that the film isn't consistent. Starts out as "regular" comedy with asides, then tries to add grand farce and bouffe elements, and it never really comes together. Plus, if you want to have farcical elements, you need a speed and intensity in cutting that this film doesn't quite get to. And there are a few non sequiturs, which may be because my hearing isn't the best and there are no subtitles. On one hand I liked the playing with the stereotypes (e.g., elevator scene towards the end), yet found slightly irritating the glasses on / glasses off clich√©. Loved the treatment of the Hat Sisters. I also like the constant reference(s) to characters who never appear.

On another level, I liked the film because it said something to me on a personal level at this time in my own life ("The Ethan Reflex"). Not that there's a "message", per se, but there happened to be a message for ME in Baxter's "words of wisdom" to Letterle.

A possibly shallow comment from me is that while the actor playing Punch is a wonderful actor and nails the character totally, he doesn't quite physically match my expectation. Sorry, but then, I'm as shallow as they come sometimes.

If you're looking for Letterle nude shots or suggestive shots or looking for soft porn, forget it. (Though there are some underwear shots for the desperate.) But if you're looking for a decent movie that stands on its own, check it out.
