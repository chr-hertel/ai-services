Good show. I was a fan of the original series, and I enjoyed this show as well. I thought Deanna Russo's acting was a bit mechanical at the very beginning of the show - particularly her initial interaction with KITT, but after the first couple of scenes in which she appeared, either she did a better job, or I did not notice any longer.

I thoroughly enjoyed it. I did not find the story to be over the top, cheesy, or unbelievable - aside from the ordinate degree of suspension of disbelief which is generally required to enjoy any work of "science" fiction.

To be sure, this is not a dramatic masterpiece by any means - but if that is one what was expecting, I doubt that one would tune into Knight Rider in the first place.
