I first saw this almost 20yrs ago - 

Being a fan of Jims other work such as the Muppet Movies , when this came along it was played over so much the VHS eventually gave up.

So glad to hear other people have seen it and appreciate how good it was.

Every single person I have asked has never heard of it...... With the exception of my cousins whom with the tape was regularly shared!!

Still now my cousins & I quote lines from it - 

Especially the "Great great great great...... Grandmother!" one.

I am trying to get a copy to show my niece of 2yrs..... 

I'm sure she will be hooked!! 

So no matter how tough life gets - there will always be a smile when i think of "The Bunny Picnic"
