Hey Michael! If ya read this.... when are you going to let me design a kick ass movie poster for you!? Anyways I too, also worked on this wacky comedy, which was a lot of fun putting together the "fixed shots." It's been a few years altogether since I've had the pleasure of meeting Michael, who is a great director in the works (also go getter/hustler I might add) ...who I admire. This was my first feature film I worked on instead of just being an extra on films. I was hoping to see a new trailer up, from which I remember was a re-edited version of the film. The Movie captures the loonyness & insanity that truly is Los Angeles & the movie industry..." lala land." I hope to see the final version soon. Long live Mashugana! -Jose
