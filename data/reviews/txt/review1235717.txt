Although i was expecting this short film to last ten seconds, it ironically lasted about 2 minutes longer. Saw it at the Landcrab Film Festival and enjoyed every second. It's about this guy who can see ten seconds into the future, and he uses this power to help himself. Then he decides to use it to help others, i won't spoil the last bit, but it was very enjoyable. I feel that the right actor was chosen to play this, and with his small accommodation it really added character. Would definitely like to see more films from Tim Clague. I can't wait to see more films from Tim Clague and hope that he does a lot better in the next Landcrab Film Festival.
