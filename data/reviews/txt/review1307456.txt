Mostly a rehash of the original, but this time, there's the Scorpion King (The Rock) to shake things up a bit. I actually saw this movie in Spain, so the one-liners were often hard to translate. But overall, we now know that movies from the 1930's are to be remade in the 1950's-1970's with a sense of camp, and then remade in the 21st century as crosses between David Lean-style epics and Harrison Ford action flicks; not only "The Mummy", but also "King Kong" comes to mind. But now that Brendan Fraser has starred in a Best Picture winner ("Crash") and Rachel Weisz has won Best Supporting Actress for "The Constant Gardener", I expect no more mummies.

And one more thing: why did the Scorpion King get his own movie? I never saw it but heard that it was just an excuse for buff men to flex their muscles. It was actually released the same weekend as "My Big Fat Greek Wedding", which of course is much more well remembered. No surprise there.
