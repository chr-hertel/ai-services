The "bad news" outweighs the "good news" for this movie.

BAD - The dialog in here is very stupid; the acting is poor (Jack Armstrong, Vivian Wu?); there is too much violence and simply a general Class B-type production feeling about this whole film, making it dumb overall. 

GOOD - It was very light on the profanity and sometimes had some pretty good special-effects with the humans turning into monsters.

STRANGE - Added to the cast is television star Jimmie Walker, who played a goofy "Kid Dyn-O-Mite" character on TV, and Mark Hamill, from the hugely-successful Star Wars movie series. Wow, times must have gotten tough for those two actors to be in this movie!

OVERALL - After watching this for an hour, it was hard to get interested enough to finish the film.
