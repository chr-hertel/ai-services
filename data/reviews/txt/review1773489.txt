Greetings again from the darkness. I would love to compare this to "Chronicles of Narnia", "Pan's Labrynth" or any of the 'Potter' films, but it just doesn't come close. The story plods to the point of boring and only a couple of action scenes even give credence to special effects crew ... or better yet, community.

With a stellar cast and a popular novel (by the controversial Philip Pullman), director Chris Weitz is just plain overmatched. He delivers a mishmash of individual scenes and just can't connect the dots into a cohesive story. Some of the shots are out of focus and the score is weak and flat and distracting.

The few bright spots are delivered by the Ice Bears (really cool) and three of the greatest voices of all time ... Sir Ian McKellan, Christopher Lee (regretably only one line) and Sam Elliott. Also terrific is newcomer Dakota Blue Richards as Lyra. She definitely has something. Nice to see Daniel Craig and one of his Bond girls (Eva Green) back together ... though not actually sharing a scene. Also good is Jim Carter in a supporting role.

Nicole Kidman just can't pull off her role and I am not sure if it the way the character is written or the manner in which she plays it. Compare her to Tilda Swinton in "Narnia" and you'll see what I mean. Nicole (who appears to be 7 ft tall in most scenes) just doesn't have the same icy stare, despite some colorized eye balls! This one is just downright disappointing and I believe most kids will find it boring and unsatisfying ... most adults will as well.
