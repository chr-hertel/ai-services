In looking over the long successful screen life of Vincent Price, we notice there are monumental stepping stones which placed him in the uppermost category as the King of Fright. This is one of those special films catapulting his star upwards to become a household word. True, the star of "The Fly" was David Hedison (Also known as Al Hedison) who plays the ambitious scientist Andre Delambre, out to invent the world's first Transporter machine, but due to his being seen briefly and only in retrospect, Price as Fran√ßois Delambre takes all the bows. In Hedison's efforts, he forgot Murphy's Law, 'If anything can go wrong it will'. Hedison builds his machine with a warning from his brother who tells him, there are things on Earth which mankind was meant to stay away from. Nevertheless, the machine is completed, Hedison steps into it with tragic consequences, resulting in both physical and moral dilemmas. His supportive but unsuspecting wife Helene Delambre (Patricia Owens) discovers only too late what the consequences are when science experiments go wrong. For the efforts of the director, the stars Herbert Marshall as Insp. Charas and especially for Prices' fans, this has become a first rate Classic. ****
