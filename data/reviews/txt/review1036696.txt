Fans of the Weird one will love this. The plot is shocking, the jokes are rubbish (in a good way) and the acting average at best but this is a great way to spend an hour and a half without your brain! The best thing about the film is when Yankovic does what he does best - parodies. Gandhi II, Conan the Librarian, Indiana Jones, Dire Straits videos and Rambo segues are p*** your pants funny.

However funny Yankovic is, the film is really a comedy showcase for the bloke who plays Kramer in Seinfeld.

Available from petrol stations and car boot sales for less than a quid usually!!
