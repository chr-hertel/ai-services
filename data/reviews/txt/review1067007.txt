This movie is interesting, as it features one of Chow's first supporting roles as a "serious" gang member, or at least as serious as Stephen Chow can be on screen. (He still cracks the occasional joke and has his quirks). The story is nothing new, essentially, ex triad member (Played by Max Mok) goes straight so he can be happy with a newfound love, but gangs are hard to get out of... This film also reeks of the late 80's with it's colossal cell phones and small boxy cars, as well as the music and clothes, but in my opinion it just adds to the experience.

Overall the actors did their jobs well and the underrated Max Mok is cool as the main character. Although this movie isn't a masterpiece it is an entertaining watch and it is interesting to see a young Stephen Chow in one of his first major roles.
