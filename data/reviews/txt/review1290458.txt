Actually i'm not interested in this movie because the "cloning" theme has been around since year 1990's,remember "The sixth Day"?. That is why i bought the DVD and saw it myself at home. Overall the action is good, the costume, not too bad but the story itself kind of dull/empty.

The leading actor and actress are wonderful. They act perfectly and they deserves compliment from this movie.

The car, well, that's marvelous, superb and totally enjoyable but too bad that we can't see the interior of it. From outside they look good but from inside, we never know because this is only a movie and everybody can messed around with the props or even the characters.

Make new story and better plot because the story is pretty long and very boring.
