This movie scared the daylights out of me and in turn I developed a major crush on Jamie Lee Curtis! The creepy music added greatly to the scare factor of this film. I may be wrong but I don't think you ever had a film with such intense killing before. All the "Nightmare on Elm Streets" and "Friday the 13th's" came after this movie. As for all the copy cats, even their own sequels and prequels to "Halloween" never came close to the original for sheer terror in your movie seat. You could probably equate it to "Physcho" in originality for its time. Having a killer not able to be killed was very unexpected. Unfortunately, it's lost some of it's original freight due to the times we live in along with the abundance of movies that try and out-due each other gore for gore.
