This is a very engaging episode about a five women singing group stranded in a Toronto by their no-good manager and Linc's attempts to get them a gig so they can make enough money to get themselves back to St Louis. 

This episode has some memorable scenes including a barroom brawl between only the females. You also get to see the amazing shot of having TV's coolest car get packed to it's absolute capacity as Tod and two girls ride up front, while the other three sit in back and Linc rides on top of the trunk facing backwards. There is also a fun appearance by Al Lewis and even a music score that isn't half bad.

There is no penetrating character study here no any deep dark revelations, but it is just as good and a nice 'breather' from the series more heavier episodes. The characters all seem very natural and real, people you wouldn't mind getting to know. They are also attractive although the one I found most attractive, Susan Ringwood, unfortunately never appeared in anything else.

Grade: A
