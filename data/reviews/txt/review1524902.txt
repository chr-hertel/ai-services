Yeah, it seems like this is the third animated film about talking penguins in as many years. Why? They're freakin' penguins, they can't even survive in warm weather. If you're going to make a shitty animated film about antarctic animals with too many celebrity voices, make it about polar bears, that hover around with chainsaws.

Nothing about this movie is funny at all, the witty one-liners fail at being witty, and can be seen from a mile away. Everything about this movie sucks, I mean why waste these actors/actresses talents when they can be used to make some uncredited re-make of a Japanese film that was actually good.

I feel that animated animal movies NEED to come to an end. Either that, or make them suck a bit less. I really regret spending money on this when I could've been home watching hockey or ranting incoherently about other movies I hate on IMDb's poorly structured message boards.

The fact that the commercial says "Novembuuurrrr" takes away all the limited credit this movie doesn't have. Seriously, if you're thinking of going to see this, pick up a video game controller or a shot gun and do something useful with your time.

Overall Rating: 0/10, but since IMDb does not allow for this, I'd give it a 1/10. This movie is awful and anyone who showers it with golden compliments is just as awful. Also, they are hell spawned battle swine.
