I wasn't interested in seeing this movie when it first came out in 2001.

I wouldn't of liked it when it did came out back 5 years ago.

Jeeper Creepers is about a teenage brother and teenage sister who don't like they're related. Cause I kept thinking of them as a couple than relationship.

They're driving the countryside on a road with almost no cars at all.

Till a mysterious old truck comes by and try to make their car crash.

After a near escape the brother wants to know what is up with that Driver that nearly killed them.

They trace the truck to an abandon church. The brother explores around till he find a large pipe which he decides to enter. His sister tells him not to but he didn't listen. Once he was down at the bottom, he discovers the basement to be a hell like place. Something he wouldn't expect the truck driver to be doing.

And the truck driver himself is not what he appears to be.

This movie is close from being crappy. Good side not as stupid as the Saw movies. Down side it needed a better direction. So not on my best horror film list. If you you like low budget horror flicks, then see about renting this movie. But don't expect it to be very great.
