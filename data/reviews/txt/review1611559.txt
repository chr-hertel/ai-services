Whatever was Warner Bros. Pictures thinking when they decided that Alfonso Cuarón should direct this film? First of all his well known film is Y tu mamá también, which was good with critics, but not really Harry Potter worthy if you ask me.

First of all, the writer of the script, Steven Kloves, did not do a good job as he had with the previous films. He completely took the book and turned it into more of a Cliff Notes version of the book with leaving some important things out of the film.

Now, don't get me wrong but the film is great as a movie, but as an adaption based upon the book it's horrible. It has many flaws, plot holes and worse of all the magic seems to be missing from this film. Not magic as in magic, but the presence of magic that the first two films brought into us fans of the books. Hogwarts even looked different to me.

For people who have never read the books you'll love it, but for readers of the books you may have mixed emotions as I did. I liked the film, don't get me wrong, I was just disappointed as a fan of the book. However, I have to give some credit to this film. Since I didn't completely hate it but didn't completely love it. Which is why I gave it a 5 out of 5.

It has it's issues, but only for readers of the books.
