Woody Allen and Diane Keaton play themselves and get the Academy Award for best picture. The setting is Woody's beloved Manhattan. There is memorable dialogue. Woody is the intellectual Jew forever questioning himself. Much was made of Keaton's mannish outfit. It was a mark of women's liberation but out of step with current disco fashion. I liked the scene where they talk with their thoughts being shown at the bottom of the screen. Christopher Walken is Keaton's weirdo brother who imagines himself in a head-on collision with an oncoming car. Walken was on the boat the night Natalie Wood drowned. Rumors flew that they were having an affair. I drove into Nashville from Lebanon to see this film and parked along the river. When I came out, my car had been towed. I understood Woody's contempt for authority. All his films come together here.
