I think most of us have been pretty spoiled by all the wonderful Disney cartoons over the years. As a result of so many "home runs", lesser Disney toons (and that is definitely a category I would place this film in) appear dull and listless by comparison. If I had never seen BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, LITTLE MERMAID or PINOCCHIO, I might have loved BROTHER BEAR. But BROTHER BEAR comes up short compared to all these great Disney films on so many levels. The quality of the animation is decent but a definite step down, the story dull and preachy and the film offered no excitement or novelty. It's just another "love the Earth" film with a heavy-handed message. As for the songs....where there even songs? I don't recall any and I certainly didn't leave the theater humming any. Overall, this is just a time-passer and a film that looked more like it should have been released direct to video.
