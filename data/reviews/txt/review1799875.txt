What were the producers thinking. What was there target audience. People in comas? Seriously. Did they think that aiming your films at human beings below the age of anyone capable of understanding a film would make them more money. The book was gritty, raw and suspenseful. Where in the name of all things bright and beautiful, and sane, did they decide on the path they chose?. What a mess. I am a film maker myself, well, in the making... and i personally would have kept it close to the books original style and aimed it towards the young persons demographic (13/14-25/26 yr old) not babies... thats all i have to say for the moment. But ill be back. possibly. well actually probably not...who cares anyway.
