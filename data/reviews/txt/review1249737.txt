I actually enjoyed this movie a lot. I thought it was pretty fun to watch. This movie is not a full on comedy but some parts are hilarious. The two main characters are played by Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt. These two are a great actors by their previous movies that they played and they played great together in this movie. This is not one of those movies that could actually happen but its interesting to watch. Mel Gibson character is thrown into a women world where he thought he knew everything about women world. He learned interesting things about women and some parts I think are pretty funny. You sort of have a smile on your face while watching this movie like I did because what the characters does. I like this movie because its fun and to watch and also a very interesting story line.
