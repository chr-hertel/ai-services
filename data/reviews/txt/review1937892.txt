This is a decent enough exploration of the lifelong friendship between two very different women, CC (Bette Midler) and Hillary (Barbara Hershey.) Meeting as children on a beach in Atlantic City, CC and Hillary are about as different as they can possibly be, but they establish a bond which for many years is basically a pen-pal relationship until they reconnect. By then, CC is a struggling actress, and Hillary has given up her rich lifestyle to become a lawyer for the ACLU. Both change over the years, CC becoming a mega star and Hillary, returning to the rich lifestyle, a frustrated housewife to an adulterous husband. Their connection remains, though, although it goes through many ups and downs over the course of the years.

For the first two thirds of the movie I was a bit frustrated with this. There seemed to be little point to it except to portray the friendship, which wasn't all that exciting, the differences between CC and Hillary notwithstanding. The last third of the movie, though, finally demonstrates what the value of their friendship is, and director Garry Marshall manages to use that last third of the movie to lift it out of mediocrity and turn this into a pretty decent, tug at the heartstrings type of film.

Others may well disagree on this point, but I found the biggest weakness here was the chemistry between Midler and Hershey. They are both fine actresses, but I just didn't feel the connection between them that I would have expected, given the nature of the friendship they were portraying. They came across to me as actresses playing friends, but somehow the authenticity of the relationship was missing. Kudos, though, to the young Mayim Bialik. She went on to modest success, mostly in TV, but demonstrated brilliant talent here playing the young CC in the early part of the film. This takes a while to really get going, but in the end, it's a moving and sensitive film about the value of friendship. 6/10
