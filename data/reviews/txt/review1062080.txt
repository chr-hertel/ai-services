This movie is a spoof, and a great one at that. It is so overlooked, and underrated that you know it has to be close to a masterpiece. The comedy comes from many different camps; Python, Mel Brooks players and Cheech and Chong, some times it can be difficult to switch gears. Each comedy troupe involved does at the very least good work for their particular brand of humor and there's some spoofing of others' comedic styles which, I think, was hilarious. I had an aunt that was living in London at the time this movie was made and was visiting when I first rented it, she flew into hysterics at parts I didn't think were funny (I was 14 at the time) which made me take a second look. I learned more about British humor and ultimately expanded my own sense of humor as a result.
