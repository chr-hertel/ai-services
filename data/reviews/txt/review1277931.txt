sure, its not the best but its decent. It opens up pretty good but then gets sort of slow with all the stuff happening to the guy whose name I cant remember. Once you see what is going on on the ship it gets pretty entertaining. The acting wasn't too great nor was the cgi but it was entertaining.

If you want to watch a monster movie with good acting and creepy creatures then you'll have to look elsewhere. I think only the mad doctor was doing good (He was believable). You cant only watch the ending for entertainment, you'll have to watch the whole thing to understand the end. See it, don't love it.
