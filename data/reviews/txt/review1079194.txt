I'll admit! Going into this movie I really wasn't expecting much. I mean come on now! A cast headlined by a bunch of has-beens, with the exception of Don Cheadle and a hip-hop artist. There really wasn't much I was looking forward to except the compelling story. When I was watching the movie I wasn't only compelled by the story, but the acting in the movie was superb. Yes! Even Chris Bridges who should just drop "Ludacris" was unbelievably compelling. "Crash" is going to be one hard movie to top this summer and I for one cannot wait to see it again on DVD or even in the theaters once more. The only reason that I didn't give this movie a 9 or a 10 is the fact that yes; There is some holes and some questionable acts in the movie, but other than those two things, This movie shines farther than ever exceeded!
