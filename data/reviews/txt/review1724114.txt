I would agree with other comments! I saw it while a film student at NYU. The film showed a clever beginning to more-than-one career, including being Danny DeVito's first film. It was totally fun.

The subtlety of DeVito's reaction shots and the sheet physicality of how he carries himself in the film were clues to what his future life-in-film would be. DeVito was able then as he is now to play comedy in a tragic setting were impressive. He also managed to be likable, despite some of the things we was cooking up in the film.

Though it is a short film, it deserves a retrospective and/or some type of visibility on the Web. I hope there is a way people can watch it in the future!
