Belmondo plays a swindler in early thirties France... His greatest creation is a new identity for himself. Completely amoral/immoral, he plays all ends against the middle.... in fact he is a Jew in France in order to swindle... and his existence is contrasted with (the Jewish) Trotsky who comes to France for political asylum... and a young Jewish actress in France to escape the Nazis. 

In the end, everyone is betrayed, but the complicated story makes it extremely difficult to follow. 

While it was going on, however, it was beautiful to watch and listen to.
