This is an excellent film and many of its great points have been mentioned in the numerous comments previously. Its interesting to see that as soon as one person rates it as low, others follow (although the majority of votes have been resoundingly positive). Some of the previous comments are also interesting as they almost ideally highlight the process that the young Harvey has been going through. Harvey sees the 'glass as half-empty' at the start but by the end it is full. Indeed his criticisms of Manuel are overwhelming but Manuel just rides the storm and we are inspired by this as well as by his ability to find joy from within and share that with others around him.
