Okay, couldn't really focus in on the documentary. Let's just say I watched it this weekend while taking care of 2 kids which equals numerous interruptions. Overall, pretty balanced. I'm really glad that they explored the destructive side of member's decisions and behavior, and the price their family and friends paid. I do however, appreciate their passion for trying to stop the war at all personal costs. They were a little delusional and smug in their youth and 70's styling and "dig this so you can dug it later" vernacular (it's laughable today). PLUS, I found the Weathermen/women so condecending towards anyone not in their socioeconomical situation. Apparently upper hierarchy within did practice elitist behavior (sorry not being pretentious, just realizing I don't know how to spell it in American English - super-screwed without spell check as you can tell). It did FINALLY click with me why the university I attended took bomb scares seriously, even in the late 80s!
