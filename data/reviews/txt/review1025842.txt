A lot of viewer comments reflect a severe dissatisfaction of Keanu Reeves' portrayal of John Constantine. I have to say that I thought he was excellent in the role. The story was taken from the comics, so it's not supposed to be "Passion of the Christ". Parts of it are a wee bit cornball, but Keanu seemed real in the role of Constantine, kind of like a Bogart turned exorcist. The zippo thing might have worn a little thin, but it was obviously an extension of his manhood. The other actors did well also, and the demons were nothing short of endearing. I am a horror movie buff, and I did not think this movie predictable in the least. It is a legitimate thriller and I would recommend it for ages 12 and above.
