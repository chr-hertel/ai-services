The ring 2 is a horror filled action move. It was incredible and and very detailed. It is about the same thing as the first one but this time they try to stop Samara from coming out again by locking the top of well.anybody who complainers about the ring 2 must have been to scarred to watch it and chick-end out and then says it sucked.Don't LISTEN TO THEM!!!THEY LIE!!! in the beginning a teens friend watched ''the movie'' and gave it to his friend. and his friend had to make someone watch it by midnight. so his girlfriend came over. he turned it on and went into the kitchen. she watched the first scene and was to scared to watched the rest so she closed her eyes. and since she didn't watch it Samara came on out and killed her boyfriend. the blond haired woman talk to her and went to the dead boys house and burned the tape in the forest. the move was only a copy and it shouldn't have worked like the original movie. Samara found out the Blondie burned the tape and then Samaria as pay back takes over the little kids body. the rest is a secret you must find it out by your self!!!!!
