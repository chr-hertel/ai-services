Entertaining! Not as bad as everyone says! Better than Firewall!

Ant & Dec rise from Saturday night television to star in a quaint British film that shouldn't have you laughing hysterically but will have you smiling. It's probably the best way to have revealed the 'true' story about the alien autopsy. 

True, you can never forget that Ant & Dec are Ant & Dec, but it doesn't detract from a thoroughly enjoyable film. If you're as gullible as the thousands who got sucked in by the original autopsy footage then you're probably the type who will be sucked in by the mistaken reviews that have already peppered IMDb. Don't be sucked in, go see this film.
