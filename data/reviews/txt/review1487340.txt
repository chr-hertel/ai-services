As much as I like Mario Kart DS, this one is simply so much better. I came across this game in an arcade when I was on holiday and discovered that while it's so much like Mario Kart DS it's also much bigger and better. I do love racing games in the arcade, with the steering wheel and pedals and seat and all.

It starts of with you getting your picture taken and the facial characteristics of your chosen driver (Luigi for me) super-imposed over your own photo. Then it's the usual course selection and driving skills. But what a fun ride! I could literally play this game for hours and hours. Unlocking all the courses and prizes. I was doing quite well and was pretty damn pleased with myself. But to continue playing would have cost a fortune. If I were a millionaire I would. I would probably just buy the machine if I were a millionaire.

Cute, colorful eye-candy. Everything such an arcade game should be. Spend your pennies on this 'un.
