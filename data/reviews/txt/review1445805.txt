Well, I just saw this pile of sh*t. It was one overpriced, bad acting, crammed, train wreck of a remake. Why do these Japanese films keep getting' remade for America? I saw the Japanese version...it's better...but..not by much....the only "scary" part about this movie is when you realize you just paid for it. Any "horror" part is shown in the trailers and previews, and really, if you watched those...you saw this movie already. The end..well..see for yourselves...but, leaves much to be desired, and some more of an explanation would have been nice, but, if you can see it cheap...well...still don't, f*ck this movie, and f*ck its crappy acting and "almost attempt" at scares, see something else for 8 bucks.
