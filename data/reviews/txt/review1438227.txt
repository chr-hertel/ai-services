Critiqing a news commentator is like trying to critique an editorial page editor. Everyone has opinions and on the "O'Reilly Factor" opinions are flying all over the place. Mr. O'Reilly has his opinions and his guests theirs. He confronts his guests and elicits responses. What makes this formula effective is that Mr. O'Reilly pulls no punches and gives his guests ample opportunity to respond, leading to interesting and revealing exchanges of opinions on a wide variety of controversial topics. Also. Bill O'Reilly doesn't duck anyone, and on every show presents his views and invites comment. This format gives "The Factor" credibility and is therefore a news program that should be watched.
