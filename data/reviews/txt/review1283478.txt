Tim Burton put together an ensemble cast on one of Hollywood's enigma directors, Edward D. Wood Jr. Burton was daring enough to film this biopic in B&W. Normally, I would avoid such things. But, this was awesome. The tones, the textures, the lighting, the scenes are fabulous. All shot in a most excellent manner. And to add the superb acting of Johnny Depp, Martin Landau, Jeffrey Jones, Bill Murray, and Sarah Jessica Parker; you have the makings of a classic film. It's ironic because the story revolves around a writer/director/producer and some of the worst films every put to a theater screen.

Although parts of the story can be dreadful, like watching Bela descend into his addition to heroin, there are some very subtle moments which are just hilarious. Landau acts out a tour-de-force performance. It is simply uncanny how well he portrays Lugosi. It is no wonder he won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.

In conclusion, even if you do not like Ed Wood or have never seen any of his films, I would still think you could enjoy this movie. However, it is soooo much better if you have some background knowledge of what you're getting yourself into. This is, by far, one of Tim Burton's greatest achievements in directing. A bold step which most would not dare take.
