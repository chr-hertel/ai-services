terrible plot flat acting horrendous hair and wardrobe. cheesier than an extra cheese pizza. totally un-sexy, Sharon stone was like a schizo muppett with a haircut courtesy of a blind person with Parkinson's's disease. Sharon stone made sex so unappealing. and wasn't the first one like 14 years ago. yeah it was, i was 13 then and totally had the hots for Sharon stone, of course now shes like 50 and desperately trying to be sexy. and somehow people think she still is. i guess the majority has set their standards very very low. anyways the budget for this movie could've went to starving Africans or something of that nature. boo hoo!
