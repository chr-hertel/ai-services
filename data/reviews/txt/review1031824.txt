Many films have many purposes. Not only that, but many films have many clichés. Black Hawk Down is not any ordinary film. War is an undervalued subject; many people do not understand its principality. Unfortunately, things in Somalia did not go according to plan. The mission was to be an in-and-out, only lasting an hour. But one minor mishap, combined with the determination of American forces to not leave behind any of their number, produced the bloodiest U.S. military action since Vietnam. Saying this, Black Hawk Down is no ordinary film.

The screenplay and character development could've been more persuading in some instances. Quite Frankly; Black Hawk Down tells us nothing we didn't already know about the hell of war and the nature of bravery. Separating itself from other war movies, Black Hawk Down tends to fall back from the familiar cliché of the usual solo-hero. Black Hawk Down compresses so many tales of courage under fire into one, big narrative that it leaves little room for individual heroics. The audience comes into contact with a newly promoted Sergeant Eversmann who does his best to keep his platoon strong and intact; and he seems like the closest thing to a hero. Otherwise, the movie doesn't focus on one main character, which in a way is good because it allows the audience to escape from the good ole' fashioned scenario of an ordinary hero.

Overall, Black Hawk Down is an enthralling movie that I would recommend to any viewers above the age fifteen and those that underestimate the true concept of war.
