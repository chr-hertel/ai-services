I personally, being a huge fan of my mentor's the Firesign Theatre loved this film. Rarely seen on film, these for or five crazy guys do a great job in a live version of "Waiting for the Count of Monty Christo ( or someone like him ) The other sketches scattered into the film is just icing on the cake. The music that was preformed live was also great. I recommend this to all old Firesign Theatre fans as well as new ones. Remember to vote Papoon for president in 2020. Riddled into the movie throughout is a campaign to elect George Papoon for president. Phil Proctor, Pete Bergman, David Ossman and Phil Austin as well as Tiny Ossman and Annalee Austin make this film come together for us. It is a rare treat and I would see it again if I could find it. It is most likely floating around in space looking for its social value. It is pure fun so go for it.
