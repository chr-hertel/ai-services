I am moved to tears every time i watch this film ! It is so moving and extremely well acted but of course what would you expect with 3 such talented stars in it ? The scene where he finds the coin sends shivers down my spine !

It is a beautiful Love story which should soften even the hardest heart. There are not that many films that i could watch over and over again but this is one of them, i never tire of seeing it.

The music is so well written/chosen that i only have to hear a few bars of the main theme and a tear appears in my eye ! A definite 10/10 in my book, but then i am a soppy old romantic !
