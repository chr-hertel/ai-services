My review is a biased one, I feel I must say firstly, being a fanatic of the games since the first was released I appreciate all the subtlties that Christophe Gans incorporated into the story and locales used in the film. 

Regarding story, Silent Hill offers a decent plot line with enough intruige to keep one entertained; personally, I think it was brilliant the way the whole thing folded out, reaching a climax that some might say is over the top but I thought was the cherry on top of the cake. The effects were incredible, the monsters, environments, mist effects, etc, were all spot on.

All in all, if you loved the games, then you will love this movie. If you didn't then its a toss up between your own tastes and what Silent Hill offers, which is, in my opinion, well worth the price of admission.
