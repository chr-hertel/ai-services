Suddenly Batman got a new definition from the Nolans, it had a past, present and future, it's not only a fictional character as defined in the comics. The "scientific backgrounds", however naive to the scientists' minds, gave a lively support for the Batman's sophistication.

The Nolans were simply gifted, every character got a new story to tell: Joker, Two-Face both had new meanings. They were no longer simple, hilarious, funny or stupid characters. And indeed I think Heath Ledger did his role better than Jack Nicholson.

It was enjoyable to see this movie, it is definitely the very definitive guide to the future Batman movies.
