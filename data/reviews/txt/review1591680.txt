When it was announced Stallone was making Rocky Part 6 most people ran for the Hills. They expected a Turkey of epic proportions. How satisfying therefore for Sly to deliver such a slick and worthy piece of cinema to perfectly top and tail Rocky.

For acting and story it was similar to Rocky and the most substantial Rocky film since Rocky. The story was well thought out and believable that a man of nearly 60 years would come back into the ring. Clearly some time and thought had been put into the screenplay.

It paid off with Stallone delivering his best " Rocky " acting performance since the first film with 2 particularly profound and moving speeches in the film.

The boxing scenes were superb and realistic and Stallone was in superb shape shaming 40 somethings such as myself.

All in all a very good effort Sly.

8 out of 10.
