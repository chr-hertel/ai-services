It must be noted that The Richard Donner cut of Superman II is not actually the Richard Donner Cut of Superman II - but rather is a close approximation to what his cut might have looked like.

For more info, one need not go far to research the story. For this review, I'd like to say that the cut, while not complete, does satisfy. It shows, as best as it can, what Donner's film would have been like.

Most notably, the tone of the film more closely matches the first film. With comic book films, there is always a tendency to admit the joke and try to have fun with it... at the expense of the story, but Superman: The Movie's success rested on it's ability to bring in humor without camp and always take the material seriously.

The restoration of Marlon Brando's scenes is worth a viewing. There are also a number of scenes that have been restored which makes the film seem "new" even though you may have seen it many times before. The best addition is the overall feel of the film which has been changed back to the more "serious" feel of part one.

Worth the money. You may kneel before Zod once again... for the first time.
