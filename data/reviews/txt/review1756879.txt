What was once a tale of terror in the woods has now become an epic story that dates back to the 1300's, in the time of King Arthur and what-have-you. This movie shows Raimi's love for slapstick comedy and Bruce Campbell turns in a great performance as Ash once again, Campbell's one-liners are hilarious but seemed a little too 'dummied-down' if you know what I mean. I feel this movie lacked the technical sophistication that Raimi usually thrived on in earlier films, it seemed a little too sloppy and cheesy in some moments (Raimi never lost his touch there). I was about 80% satisfied with the movie and 20% critical of how it was handled. Overall it is a great, enjoyable and laughter filled picture but the plot just seemed too condensed, I just really feel that the plot could have had more meat on it's bones, oh well, all in all I'am still glad Raimi came out with this movie and I look forward to another possible sequel in the future if he decides so.
