Mars Attacks! (1996) Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Sarah Jessica Parker, Martin Short, Jim Brown, Pam Grier, Michael J. Fox, Danny DeVito, Lukas Haas, Sylvia Sidney, Rod Steiger, Paul Winfield, Natalie Portman, Tom Jones, Joe Don Baker, D: Tim Burton. Schlocky parody/homage to '50s alien-invasion inspired loosely by a series of bubble gum trading cards. U.S. President Nicholson is optimistic when an army of martin flying saucers are found hovering around the Earth, but everyone has a different response, until they are greeted in Nevada and turn out to be nasty predators who want to wipe out the population! Cartoonish special effects and animation (of the martians) are good since the movie is a live-action cartoon, but while campy and a hoot, it feels self-satisfied and Burton bites off more than he can chew with the big-name cast. 107 min., rated PG-13. ** Â½
