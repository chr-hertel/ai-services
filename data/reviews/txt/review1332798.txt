Alabama owes Tonya a big thank you for sharing this sweet story with us. She has shared so much of herself via this movie, her story, her family (daugher Lily as main character and husband Kelvin is the voice of Lily's dead father, as well as many other family members in crowd scenes), friends, the beauty of her home state...each and every frame of this movie is a part of Tonya in a multitude of ways. For a first attempt at a feature length movie, this was wonderful. Yes, there were some parts of the movie that could have been different, better, or left out. But this is MY opinion and everyone has one. I am not a film-maker and do not criticize what I have no understanding of. Now, as far as some of the comments that have been posted...most have been useful. Some have been spiteful and obviously the writer did not even bother to educate themselves before they spoke. Jeez, they couldn't event spell the names right! I hope this person (and I use the word loosely) does not live in a glass house. If you were so tortured watching the movie, why not get up off of your lazy, critical a** and leave. I am not sure where you saw the movie, but I am pretty d*** sure that you were NOT tied to the chair and forced to watch. How old was this miserable person? Old enough to remember the racial climate in 1965 (go back and read the papers and magazine articles written on the subject at the time). Most of the civilized world understands that we have progressed and NOT expect "inbred morons" when they arrive. See W.I.F.T.O. and decide for yourself.
