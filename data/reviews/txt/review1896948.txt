I saw this movie in my church several months ago and it keeps coming back to me over and over again. Usually when I enjoy a film this much I don't want to see it again because I don't want to ruin my memory of how great it was the first time round. 

It came up in conversation with two different people a few weeks ago (when two other couples were talking about a planned wedding for a friend of ours) and I decided this would make a good wedding present. So I ordered the DVD for a gift and when it arrived - I couldn't not watch it. I ended up ordering another one for the gift and 4 more for others.

The second time around was a different experience. The movie was actually better. Usually, knowing how something is going to end can ruin the set-up. This time it actually gave it another level of drama and expectation. The richness of the stories and the way they are layered together is so effective because it pulls you in on a purely emotional level. 

Maybe my expectations for a "talking heads" documentary were very low - but whatever the reason, the thoughtfulness and sensitivity that went into this one just makes for a great movie. The music is to die for and this is one of the few DVDs I've ever bought where the extras actually added to the experience of the whole -- rather than demystify and hype the main event.

I'll add that my husband had no interest in watching the movie and after popping his head in the den a few times to find out why I was laughing, he finally plopped down on the sofa and watched the rest of it with me. Near the end we were holding hands and I looked over and he was totally tearing up. Afterwards he said, 'That was pretty good.' Now he wants to watch the whole thing from the beginning.
