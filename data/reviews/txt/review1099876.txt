Another excellent Korean movie. It has everything good movie needs, sometimes its disgusting, sometimes its funny. Couldn't find any errors and the twist in the end caught my by surprise.

This is one of those movies that you shouldn't miss. Although it has some very weird scenes the movie is pretty understandable even in one watching. I've also seen Old Boy and some actors are in both movies, but the acting was great (I didn't like Sooni's acting though, don't know what was wrong with it, just couldn't get the idea what that character was all about anyway).

This is semi-low budget movie but still the special effects were great, and I think that the less CGI the movie has the better. As others have mentioned if you cant stand blood and some very disgusting scenes you shouldn't watch this but other than that this is a must see.

And no, this is'int 'sci-fi' movie really, it has couple sci-fi scenes but thats about it.
