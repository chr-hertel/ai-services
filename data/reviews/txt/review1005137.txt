This film is simply magnificent. For all those who worry that the movie will do disservice to the stage production, stop fretting. The film follows the live production very closely; having seen Phantom on stage twice, I know. Also, all of the actors do a fine job--yes, even Gerard Butler. Emmy Rossum's voice may not be as mature as Sara Brightman's, but it is still clear and pure. I was very impressed with the first half of the film, but I was anxiously waiting for "Masquerade" which opens the second act; I knew if the director Schumacher could pull this off, he had hit the mark. The production number was absolutely marvelously done! Finally, at the conclusion everyone in the audience applauded--they were so moved and didn't know what else to do with that emotion. So, they applauded, even though it was a film and not a live performance.
