Of all the possibilities for a sequel they made all the easy and bad choices. Simply put, a predator in LA is just boring. It slaughters people then disappears, but not altogether, and back and forth. Plus the more you see it (when it's time for a heads-up), the more it looks like a man in a suit (a well-known problem in horror flicks since Cat People or The Creature from the Black Lagoon).

The story is a big mess, characters are thrown in the middle, every one of them just fodder for bloody action. Danny Glover is artificially locked in the role of a naive brutal cop, an odd characterization for the man in charge here (maybe they wanted to add some kind of Lethal Weapon subtlety). The "creative" team put 90% of its energy in fleshing up the Big Alien Hunter, and finding reason to have it run away until the final showdown which, in turn, is overlong (tough to kill your ugly darling, uh?).

The first Predator had the benefit of creating the unknown menace in hostile jungle. The big team of over-armed hunters gradually became the game. With the expectations for the first installment this didn't make sense to build the narrative away from a team of experts trying to come to grips with that elusive phenomenon. Or it would have made more sense to go for a musical staged by John Woo: John Doe Meets Predator.
