A psychotic killer who gets his jollies by strangling nurses is on the prowl. Two nurses, their bed-ridden patient, and a housekeeper who likes to hit the bottle a bit too much are all alone in a creepy mansion during a furious storm, and it soon becomes apparent that the killer has marked them for his next little escapade.

If some of this sounds familiar, it's because the plot borrows heavily from the classic chiller "The Spiral Staircase" -- and then adds a hearty dollop of "Psycho" to the mix. (And in fact the exterior setting for this story is the self-same grim Victorian monstrosity that was used five years earlier for the Bates house.) 

Perhaps because the final twist has subsequently been employed by many a copycat (almost to the point of clich√©) I saw what was coming pretty early on. But when this was first broadcast in the mid-1960s, the ending must have been a real shocker; even now this episode of "The Alfred Hitchcock Hour" has a strikingly tense and morbid atmosphere.

I'd still have to give "The Jar" slightly higher marks for its unique story and Swamp Gothic/EC Comics sensibility, but this one comes mighty close. It certainly qualifies as one of the very best of the series.
