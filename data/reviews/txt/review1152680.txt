I caught a sneak preview of this flick from the front row of a packed theater. Nonetheless, a good time was had. What intrigued me about this movie was twofold. 1) It was free. 2) One of my female colleagues first told me about it and read aloud many of the dirty words and phrases, often times naming body parts and acts that I found incredibly exciting. I would have expected a movie with such a narrow focus to drag, but it didn't. I was also expecting some sort of free-speech slant to things, which would have been incredibly boring. But they didn't do this either. It was just pure entertainment. My only word of caution: See this movie at an off-peak time. There will be a lot of braying from the audience (and applause, God help us), which can drown out some of the dialog. The jokes come in rapid succession, so a boisterous crowd will certainly tax the ear if not ruin jokes entirely. Enjoy!
