I saw this movie after johny gaddar and before seeing i liked johny gaddar but Manorama exceeded my expectations.. it was superb suspense movie with very normal background and yet it showed powerful message in the film.. till half way of the film I lost patience and interest but then again it started and I am glad that I did not left the movie at half way.. nowadays movies have big stars and beautiful backgrounds and splendid film sets.. this movie proves that big sets and good makeups are really not needed nowadays..(But the mass don't understand this) Good film needs good direction, good script and finally good execution.. Manorama deserves 10 out of 10.. but still can not give that as perfection is dangerous for ambition..!!
