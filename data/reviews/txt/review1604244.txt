This was by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Keep in mind that I'm a huge Stallone and Dolly fan, but the singing and "stage antics" of Stallone in this made me long for Scott Baio's singing career to make a comeback. Stallone basically sings the way he talks, and jumps around and dances on stage like he's hyped up on something. Sly's brother is a good singer, HE ISN'T. Some people should never sing.....EVER. It is actually very hard to watch without actually feeling sorry for him. Dolly must have been mortified once she saw the final product. I'm giving it a two out of ten, simply for the "shock value".......
