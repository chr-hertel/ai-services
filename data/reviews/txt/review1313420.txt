I just watched this movie and was pleasantly surprised by it. Granted, this movie's more of a compliment to the video game of the same name, but it extends the back story of the game and gives a different look at the scenarios. This movie'd probably be more liked by fans of the game than to most other people, but it can be all but assured to be a fun, entertaining flick for just about anybody.

Parents, if it wasn't obvious by the trailer, this is not a kids movie, but I feel it'd be fine to let older kids watch this film. Great effects good writing without a lot of gratuity and nice cast earn this movie at least a 7 for me.
