I've heard some bad reviews about this movie everywhere, so I thought to go and see it if all those reviews were true and surprisingly I like it. The story about a Vegas illusionist that haves the gift of watching his immediate future, the FBI is looking for him to tell them where's a nuclear weapon and he falls in love of a woman he watches in his future but doesn't know in person, I think it was original, clever and very interesting. I has lots of action, a little bit of romance, some involuntary humor, very good twists and a very unexpected ending although some parts may not bet believable at all. The plot was in my opinion very well developed and convincing, although it has some incongruence. The special effects are very good and the landscapes are beautiful. About the cast, I think everybody made a decent job, Nicholas Cage without any effort delivers a good performance as Cris Johnson/ Frank Cadillac, Jessica Biel also works very well besides she looks gorgeous. Jullianne Moore convince me in his role of officer Callie Ferris, a beautiful but rude police woman. In conclusion, I think this movie was better than I heard and expected, it was entertaining and enjoyable, will keep you on the edge of your seat and you must be focused from the very first minute of the film or you will lose it.
