Sure, the film has some funny off-color moments but there are two scenes so out of line,it becomes infuriating.

The first is when wedding crashers John and Jeremy mention how displaying fake Purple Hearts impress chicks and show two such medals in a box. For those of you still uninformed, wearing fake P.H.s as well as the Medal of Honor is a federal crime and a descecration to the brave who earned such awards.

Secondly,their friend Chaz, tells John(Owen Wilson) that chicks can be swept off their feet at funerals and try it. Talk about SLEAZE. John realizes how wrong it is and ceases such obnoxious behavior. Sorry readers but those two incidents cast a shadow over this so called amusing film. I enjoy a comedy but never at the expense of the departed.
