John Carpenter had looked at urban decay in "Assault on Precinct 13", but took it to a whole new level with "Escape from New York". In 1997, war hero-turned-convict Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is hired to rescue the president (Donald Pleasance) from New York City, now a maximum security prison (to accommodate the crime wave that swept the country in 1988).

This is certainly one cool movie. Wearing an eye-patch, Kurt Russell looks like the ultimate bad-ass. And mark my words, that's exactly what Snake is. As for New York as a maximum security prison: it's any bad mother****er's wet dream. And the other cast members: Isaac Hayes (yes, the "Shaft" singer and Chef on "South Park") plays the Duke, who is in complete control of the Big Apple; Ernest Borgnine plays Cabbie, who knows exactly how to survive in this most dangerous land; Harry Dean Stanton plays Brain, one of Snake's former acquaintances; and Adrienne Barbeau plays Maggie, Brain's hubby.

Oh, and I noted that there's a pizzeria here in Portland called Escape from New York. It's located on NW 23rd St, if you ever come to Portland.
