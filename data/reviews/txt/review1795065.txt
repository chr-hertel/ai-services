The movie debut of The Muppets has Kermit and company heading west seeking Hollywood stardom. While it's fun spotting stars in cameo roles, they are given little to do. The script is quite lame, with only a few chuckles here and there. The film is aimed primarily at kids and they will enjoy it, but it's tough going for others. Kermit is an adorable character and he and Miss Piggy make a cute couple but that is not enough to sustain a feature film. "Rainbow Connection" is a nice tune but the other songs are not memorable and there are too many of them. Although only about an hour and a half long, it seems to go on too long.
