I'm probably one of the many fans who haven't read the book, but Lord of the Rings still rocks! This is without a doubt the best movie I've seen (kicking the Harry Potter movies's asses by a mile). The acting is, from what I think, terrific. Unlike a lot of fantasy books, LOTR seems more than just a fantasy/adventure story. It's almost like a mythology. It's very believable, and Peter Jackson is an excellent director. He made all the actors read the books, that's some amount of dedication if you're transferring a much loved classic onto the screen. I'm told by most people that some of the things from the books where taken out in the movies, but it's still good. But with a book-to-movie you can't add everything and things have got to be taken out. Unlike some book-to-movie movies *cough*Harry Potter*cough* everything taken out seems sensible and there still is some point to the movies.
