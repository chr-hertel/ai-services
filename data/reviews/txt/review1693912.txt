I will start off by saying that this movie was absolutely terrible. First, the positive parts, There were some very good close-up shots, along with some good lighting, but that's pretty much it. Now the bad. The worst thing about this movie is that the writing is incredibly bad. Everything that happens is predictable and it's all clich√© as hell. The next crappy thing about this movie is that each torture scene is done is little segments that end with a fade out to black. The torture scenes seem really worthless and it seems that 2/3 of the movie Elisha Cuthbert is just crying and yelling "no" and "please". so, if you love stupid, boring horror movies with no plot, then this just might be the movie for you.
