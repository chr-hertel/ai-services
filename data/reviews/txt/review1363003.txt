When I first saw the preview for Tristan + Isolde, I thought it looked very stupid, especially because they were playing a modern pop song by Evanesence throughout it. Plus, I felt as if movies with very similar plot lines had been done quite recently (Troy, Alexander, etc.), and none had fared particularly well. This seemed like a B-list version of one of those movies.

I'm not quite sure why I decided to see the movie, when it got mediocre reviews and had a misleading preview. But one day when I was sick, I decided to rent it, hoping it would distract me from being ill.

To say the least, this movie was a lot better than I had expected. Sure, the accents weren't exactly up to par, and the dialog was clunky, and the "love" between Tristan (James Franco) and Isolde (Sophia Myles) seemed more like lust, I still really liked it. I thought the two main actors had great chemistry, and the action sequences were well done. It won't win any awards, but I thought that the title relationship in the movie was believable. At the least, the movie was an above average action/romance flick with pretty stars. And there's always James Franco's brooding good looks.
