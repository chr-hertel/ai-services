I rented this movie from BlockBuster on a recommendation from a friend. I was pretty excited to hear about another horror movie that was made independently then went straight to DVD. I was hoping it would be like Evil Dead, but it was more serious (and less loud). It was kind of slow moving here & there, but the storyline was very cool and there were some really surprisingly good actors that I had never heard of before. I heard that someone in the cast or crew died! Does anyone know if that's true? One last question, because I watched the part over & over trying to figure it out: That demon who jumps at the camera in the bathroom or whatever scared the crap out of me! But I have to ask- is it a guy or a girl?! It ~sounds~ like a girl crying, but it's so hard to tell these days with make up and all. Utterly CREEPY! Could you just imagine walking into use the bathroom & having THAT jump out at you? LOL, it would be a mess! I'm just curious, if anybody knows? Definitely worth a look!
