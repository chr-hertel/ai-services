This show has some of the wildest medical scenarios I've seen--love it, don't care if they're realistic or not. The writers are great, witty, stylish...the character arcs just keep moving and the actors are absolutely making this show the best! I can't believe some of these actors have been working a long time and I haven't noticed them. I love that there is balanced time for all the characters throughout the season, not too much emphasis on one set of characters or another. I've spent the summer catching up on the first season, which I had missed and watching last season again, and I'm not big on reruns. So what can I say? I just really like this show. I can't wait for the new season! My favorite episode? Season 2's--after the Superbowl, 2-parter. Edge of your seat!!!
