Great Job Timur! Russian Director with Rus/USA team made a great Russian/American Movie and proved that the Rus/USA mix in cinema could be a good thing. McAvoy and Jolie did a great job, great acting. Look at Jolie's reaction after McAvoy takes the gun and try to escape from this crazy place. I'm sure Stanislavsky said "I believe" from the sky at this moment. Special effects are awesome. It's not Hollywood Sp.Ef. It's Timur's Original Style with Sp.Ef. Looks beautiful. The story i think is a mix from Matrix and Fight Club but it's OK. It's not about plagiarism, it's about parody. Hope Timur will do Hollywood again. 10/10
