I can't sleep, so I'm flipping the dial and see this dude that looks a lot like Byron Allen but the guy's head is shaved and the show is called "Entertainment Studios.com". HUH?? Was I having a nightmare or was this dreck actually being broadcast?

The show's entire content is made up of promo interviews provided by the studios, along with movie trailers, bad comics, and music videos. Between the cheesy music, the obsolete graphics, Allen as host, his wife(?)as producer, and the aforementioned filler, what's the budget...about $47.26 an episode?

I somehow stumbled through the entire program and SWEAR that Allen said "Comin' up neeeeext" prior to every commercial break. Wasn't this guy a comedian at one point in his career? How about some original material, fella?? Anyway, if you want a belly laugh, stay with the show until the end credits and you will be rewarded with a can't miss REALLY bad edit as the music loop runs out. Maybe Byron does the sound editing as well to save a few more bucks?? 

This really IS syndicated programming at its worst. I'd prefer watching "Conversation with Fred Lewis" a 1980's infomercial for New Generation hair growth shampoo...
