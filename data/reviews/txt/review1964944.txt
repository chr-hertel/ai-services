This movie is not well known but it's really worth watching. I don't know much about Polish cinema but this is probably one of the best Polish movies. It's very entertaining crime comedy. The budged of this film is pretty low but the plot, acting and directing compensate it. There isn't much jokes but the ending was really funny. It's also good as a crime movie. I liked the dialogs between criminals and also the way they planed bank robbery. If you get a chance to see this movie, don't waste it because it's really interesting (althau it may appear a little boring in the beginning). I also liked the style of these gangsters - the way they talked and worked reminded me of some Hollywood crime movies.
