i was at a pre-screening of this film last week and it blew me away. as an American, i wasn't sure what to expect, but at about 20 minutes in i came to see this story as Hoop Dreams with a twist. the story is of five teens who use a lifetimes' worth of passion, skills and wares and engage in soccer street performances (which, by themselves, are worth the price of admission) to raise enough money to trek down to buenos aires to meet their idol, diego maradona. the story is touching and beautiful in its simplicity -- what these boys are willing to go through to meet their idol, without the lure of achieving fortune or fame, makes their quest entirely pure -- the same type of quest that as children made us want to play sports in the first place. for me, the boys' motivation really rang true. 

also, their trek to meet maradona is totally captivating and has all the hallmarks of a cool, road trip movie. the boys' journey is from nyc to buenos aires through Latin America. it's very interesting how they come together and how their growth as individuals and as a unit impacts certain decisions as they get closer to achieving their goal. their journey is in constant motion, given the host of countries they have to travel through, and it gives the film a pacing that allows the story to fly by. i was shocked to be told the movie was 100 minutes. it feels like it's an hour long. 

last but definitely not least, as i mentioned the street performances are, by themselves, worth the price of admission. i've never seen stuff like what these kids pull off effortlessly and with regularity. just unreal! this is a must see film and it's definitely a story that has a universal quality and appeal to it; it's funny, entertaining and touching. 

A great film ...
