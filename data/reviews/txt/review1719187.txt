I was kind of fooled by the marketing of this but it sounded intriguing anyway and I'd learned the lesson that seemingly gross out comedies like American Pie, Old School and The 40 Year Old Virgin can actually be good fun and have a lot more going for them.

Do NOT think this is some kind of gross out or tasteless low brow comedy, despite the unfortunate marketing and apparent subject matter. In fact if anything it struck me as a very well crafted old fashioned romantic film at heart (in a good way). This is really probably not the film you think it is.

High points. The cast is excellent, absolutely all on top form for every character. The direction, photography and use of music are top notch - everything seems to hit the right note perfectly. You start out thinking you'll see a crass comedy and end up seeing a very skillfully made film, with likable characters and a really good heart at the core of it. It's also extremely funny! Low points. It's very much a fantasy film and very romantic. In this sense it really doesn't touch on it's supposed core theme 'the porn industry' in any realistic way. Porn producers are lovable rogues. AIDS is never mentioned. The whole thing is so wholesome! I don't really think this is a low point as the film is essentialy a romantic fantasy and the portrayal of the porn characters is very funny and in no way meant to be realistic.

I really enjoyed it.
