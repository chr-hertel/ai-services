There's normally just something wrong with the phrase PG-13 horror. Usually not enough blood for the slasher people, not enough skin for those looking for that type of thing, and they're usually so careful NOT to show anything that might get into R territory that even the scares are toned down to the point of non existence. Here we have a solidly made reasonable well acted and competently produced action horror hybrid which does its level best within the PG guidelines to at least try to generate some creepiness, since no real heavy shocks are or can be involved. It involves a set of families that have kept a secret promise ergo covenant and what happens when the latest generations of these families begin to test their limits. Reasonable story for what it is, absolutely gorgeous if somewhat dreary scenery, effects are reasonable for the obvious budget constraints, and the acting in general is at least serviceable to the story. If you're looking for a reasonably well made movie of the PG horror type you should check this one out.
