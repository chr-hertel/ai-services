I use IMDb scores as a pretty good guide to a film. If it's over 8/10 I'm pretty much guaranteed I'll enjoy it.

Not this time. This was the worst film I've seen this year.

The main character was unbearably smug. It was nauseating seeing him almost punch the air at his good fortune, giving it all away and living for the moment. Ho hum, here comes another pan-out on a helicopter. Most of the film felt like an ad but the cans of coke never arrived. In fact ads these days have more conflict in it than this film.

I kept wishing ill on him just so we could have a little tension. Sure, a few parental issues but they loved him very much. The negative should have come out a lot stronger. Instead we are narrated the story by the only character more mawkish than our hero, his sister.

I'm a nature buff who's lived an unconventional life with lots of travel. But really, it took him two years, 2.5 hours of film and endless philosophising to realise that people need company? Come on. Maybe if he had time to watch one Hollywood blockbuster, he would have learned that and we could have all saved ourselves the bother.
