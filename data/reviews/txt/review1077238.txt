James Dean plays Jim Stark, a troubled teen who's come to a new town with his parents. These parents of his don't give him the love and respect he needs, and that's why he's so rebellious.

In the new town, he discovers a girl (Natalie Wood) who gives Dean some of what he needs. He also finds a friend in a young boy played by Sal Mineo. Dean takes it upon himself to show Mineo the kind of friendship they both need.

Rebel Without a Cause is somewhat of a psychological look at the concerns of a teenager and how they have needs and are growing people. They have growing minds and imaginations that can go wild. If their minds aren't tamed, they'll become rebellious like the ones in the movie. 

The film also takes a look at how parents seem to dislike their growing children and just try to let them handle themselves. Parents don't realize that all the teenagers need is a loving, caring relationship.

Rebel Without a Cause is the poster for so many generations of teens today and years ago. It's as tough and gritty as it is thoughtful and the film will still pack a punch after all these years and for years to come.
