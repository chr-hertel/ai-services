Gossip Girl is a fresh new juicy soap for a range of different people and I admit - I'm hooked. Its only been 18 episodes so far, and I get can't enough its all simply about - THE DRAMA! and its great. The characters made my expectations, I fell in love with them all, they are all unique and each individual holds a part of the show and without that part, the show would simply not be the same, the only thing I hate is that I have to wait until July for it to come out on box set! Oh and September for the premiere of SEASON 2 :D, I can't wait! Watch the show and I put my life on the matter that you'll be craving for the next episode to appear on your television screens. You know you love me. XoXo Gossip Girl
