The Good: This movie has a great feel-good message. Hey, lets end violence, get educated and erase the color lines. This is not a new message and somewhat a Hollywood staple, but its a good one.

The Bad: It reinforces every stereotype of race. The 'uneducated black gangster', 'the sassy Hispanic girl who's trying not to get pregnant', and 'the nerdy white guy with no friends.' Gimme a break! Its 2007, aren't we past this?! Hollywood and MTV, please stop your racial profiling. 

As a teacher, I found this to very self-indulgent for teenagers. Lines like 'no one understands us', or 'its so hard for us.' Teenagers are self-centered enough, without movies like this reinforcing it.

Like other posters said...its a complete ripoff of Dangerous Minds, Finding Forrester...etc.
