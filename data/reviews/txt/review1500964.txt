A boy from my class showed the movie as a presentation. I didn't know what to expect. I think the movie was really good. It wouldn't be my favorite choice but i wouldn't mind watching it.

It's not really a movie for people who don't like killing and blood and stuff but if you can handle that it's quite fun to watch. I think the actors did well,because it probably won't be easy tot play such a role. So to people who like watching movies with killing and blood. I recommend this movie to them. I give it a big plus! A 10 of course. So watch this movie because it's a really good one!! But watch it with subtitles because you might not speak Japanese.
