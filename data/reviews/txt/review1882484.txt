I am seriously going to owe my "man friend" for life after dragging him with me to see this film. As a fanatic of the original series I was giddy with excitement about this film... until i watched it. What happened to the character's that I used to love and know?? Somehow on my screen instead of seeing the girl's and the men that they love the way I had come to love them over the years, I found on the cinema screen in front of me a bunch of screaming idiots wearing expensive clothing and carrying around over the top accessories... nothing at all as they used to be. In the end I blame the writing because the script was the movie's biggest down fall and has let us all down. They had years to make this movie great, but now oh how i wish they had just left it as it was... a great show that ended after 6 seasons... a memory now tainted by this film.
