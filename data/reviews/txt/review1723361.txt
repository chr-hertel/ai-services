I wanted to rate this a 0 in my book. I'm so sick of Brian Singer,I think he is the worst director in movie history. He only thinks of himself. He's not even a comic fan. You need to be one to direct these. He does changes to the costume and everything else in the movie and does'nt care about the fans of the comics. That myself is not right,If you're not going to be faithful to the books than don't do them at all. Also they chose the wrong actor for the part,He is not big enough to play Superman. the plot was absolutely ridiculous. I refuse to watch anymore of his films.If anyone out there likes this film knows nothing about comics enough said. This director needs to stop directing and find a new job like a supermarket or something and stay the hell out of Hollywood. His AVP movie was embarrassing to all fans. everyone can agree with me there. How did he become a writer and director? If he can do it then anyone can.
