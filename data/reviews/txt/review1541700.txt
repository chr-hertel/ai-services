A criminal, 2'6, is released from jail. He learns from his mistake to not use a gun. Now he, with his friend, robs a jewelery store. Once leaving the diamond in a lady's purse, the duo tries to get it back by making the short criminal, Calvin, a baby, which the lady and her husband always wanted.

First off, in my opinion, I found this film funny. It's not as funny as White Chicks but it's funny and it's a good film. It's certainly not the worst film. I'm probably one of the people who like these films. The others would probably hate it.

The acting is decent in the film. The technology of putting Marlon Wayans' head on top of Linden Porco's body is good. They sure spent most of their time doing it and it paid off.

The jokes are funny and clever at some times. There are some usual fart jokes and physical humor, which is fine by me. It's not nearly as bad as I thought people have said it was. It's not even close to being a bad film. There are even some sweet moments in this film. I am NOT joking!

What will the Wayans think of next? First, a spoof, next, two black men in white make-up, and now this?! It's amazing. This is just entirely my opinion. You may disagree me as much as you want. I don't care. I thought this film was funny and sweet. You may think it's just a horrible comedy and think of why would they spend so much time and money in this project. Agree with me or not, I thought this film was funny. If you liked White Chicks, you would certainly like this film.
