I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. Although I think its down-tempo and simple story line are a little of a let down, the rest of the film is pure magic.

The movie is based on a great illusionist who re-encounters his childhood-friend/girlfriend. After that you know what... he tries to run away with her even though she's engaged to the Crown Prince. So don't expect complex and mind blowing intrigues.

What I believe to be the appealing part of the movie was the plot around the boy chases girl thing. The great magic tricks along with a solid structure are what the film is all about. After all, a credible scenario along with intelligent and creative ideas are enough reasons to make it a good movie.

Having Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti amongst the cast is just a proof that the acting is top notch. You can't even complain about Jessica Biel as far as I'm concerned.

The soundtrack sets the ambiance just right, so thumbs up for the whole environmental aspects of the movie.

Basically a great film, although I recommend it when you're in a mood for a non-existent-action mystery/romance flick.
