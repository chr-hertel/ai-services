While some of this movie was incredibly funny, Ricky's arch nemesis is one of the most awful characters I've seen in a film in years! His acting is atrocious, his accent unbelievable, his character stupid. Even if the plot wasn't thin, this character still ruined the film entirely. With his omission, a better character could have been in the film, but then I guess the film would have been more like Disney's Cars.

On a positive note, the race scenes were great, and the relationship between Ricky Bobby and his best friend, Cal, brought many laughs to the audience. The actors who played the pit crew and Ricky's father were all great. The two women in the Ricky Bobby's life had great moments, but Amy Adams did some overacting on more than one occasion.

Wait for the video release, and then make your friend pay for it.
