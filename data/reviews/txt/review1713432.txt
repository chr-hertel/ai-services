My advice: just don't lose your precious time watching this dumb movie... a couple of feeble smiles aren't worth it... old 'jerky' jokes, old dummy expressions on the faces of the cast, a stale plot: just disgusting... what irritates me the most (I would actually say "pisses me off") is that this so-called "movie" is rated higher than one of the best (and my personal favorite) comedies of all time "Mrs. Doubtfire"!..

Unfortunately, sense of humor becomes more and more degraded lately, - that's why Will Ferrel and those of his ilk thrive nowadays... Also, I'm surprised to see how FUNNY those 'jokes' for some of the users: maybe, they even laughed at "San Diego - vagina" translation - for some of them it's even "memorable"... that's pathetic...
