After hearing all the hype, I watched this movie today. It wasn't very good. Not too funny at all. I don't know what all the hype is all about. It isn't worth a look, even if you catch it on cable. I love comedies and watch a lot of movies, but this one was pretty bad. Steve Martin's acting was phony and not "at his best" like some have claimed. Maybe my expectations were too high. It isn't the worst thing I have seen, by any stretch, but not good at all. Oh well, I'm glad to get this one off my DVR once and for all. 

I really don't know what else to say about this movie. 

*spoiler***************

There is a scene where Steve Martin is working at a gas station and three Latinos are stealing gas and tires from him. He decides to show them by hooking up a roped hook to the car and puts the other end on a water pipe at a church next door. When the guys drive off, half of the church goes with them, wedding in progress. It was unrealistic and unfunny. I mean, I love ridiculous humor like the Scary Movie series or the Airplane movies, Funny Farm, Fletch movies, etc... but this is just stupid. 

Don't waste your time with this one. Sorry Steve Martin. The more I think about your work, like Father of the Bride, Three Amigos, and some other stuff, I really am coming to the conclusion that you are not that funny. You, Steve Martin, are overrated for sure. I never realized until now how unfunny he is.
