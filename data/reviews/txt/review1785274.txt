I saw this movie for the first time when I was around 10 years old. I guess I never fully understood the context, anymore than an absolutely stunning visual masterpiece could be a by a 10 year old. I do, however remember this movie, and it stayed with me for years. Maybe it was the adorable characters, whom have individual talents that children dream about, maybe it is the grandfatherly Baron himself, who warms your heart as the patriarch of good sense and the abolisher of disillusionment. Just maybe it is the soundtrack, (the end theme is one of THE BEST orchestrated numbers ever written for screen.) And that is really what i hold to. The sounds and visual effect make this somewhat foolish story of whimsy so profound, it is hard to pull away. It has been 15 years since I last saw this movie (till today, when it was on MOJO HD theater) , and i did not realize how much talent was packed into the cast. I could go on with description of story and character role, but nothing i can say will prepare your soul for the type of warmth you receive from being part of one of the greatest adventure movies of all time. This is the type of movie that makes your hair stand at end and warms you to your core as a child drinking hot cocoa on a cold winters day. As the orchestra kicks in with the Baron dancing with the enticing Goddess Venus (played by the beautiful Uma Thurman) I nearly wept for joy, realizing my mind was as young and free as it had been nearly 20 years ago. Please do yourself a favor and watch this movie, not as a film critic, but as a free spirit. Let your mind go to the surreal place you once lived as a child. You will not be disappointed
