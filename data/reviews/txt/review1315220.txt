How did this movie ever get the reputation as a horror classic? I've been re-watching the "Friday the 13th" series recently and have been struck by how awfully incompetent they are as films. This first installment I guess has the advantage of being novel, though not really, since it doesn't use any formula conventions that "Halloween" didn't use two years earlier. And the actual film making technique in "Halloween" makes it seem like "Lawrence of Arabia" compared to this.

Still, there is something nostalgically satisfying about these movies. Seeing dopey teenagers get axed in the face and knifed through the throat brings a little glow to my heart. This was made at a time when slasher movies had a kind of innocence that horror movies now have lost. These films were nasty at the time, but they're absolutely quaint when compared to the nasty cinema coming out now in the same genre, a sad testament to just how jaded we've become.

As far as rating this particular movie, not all of the movies in the series are as bad as this one, but I can't bring myself to give the original anything other than a big fat F.

Grade: F
