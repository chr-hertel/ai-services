I was with this film for the first 15 minutes or so, until the extremely unfortunate poetry reading. This film is silly at best, unfunny and boring at worst. The forced laughter that everyone seems to have experienced along with this film was quite unwelcomed. Especially since those people that were laughing have read/seen those jokes a dozen times before. Why were they laughing hysterically? Why did they stop using the Guide references? They were the best part of the film and were just dropped fairly early on. The robot was stupid and NEVER funny. Did it ever occur to Arthur to put on some real clothes and quit wandering through the galaxy in his bathrobe? Oh, I suppose that was just supposed to be "ironicly amusing". Yeah the whole film seems to be like that. Dolphins in space, worshipping boogers. It's all just a bunch of bunk that left my audience quite cold, except for the afore-mentioned gaggle of uber-geeks. Bottom line, if you think Dr. Who rules all, this movie is for you. If not, wait to rent.
