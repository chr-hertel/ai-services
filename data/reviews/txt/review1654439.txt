It just is too long. And although I think Martin Scorsese should've gotten his Oscar for another movie than this (so the decision was right not to give him one here imho), I also think he made better movies than Departed. Then again Departed delivered and satisfied more than this!

The acting from Di Caprio is good (much better than in Gangs), although some of the scenes (or better the script) seems to let him down. Even a scene in a cinema hall, really happened (the movie is based on real characters, fyi if you didn't know already), it just didn't translate that well on screen, imho! And the real characters? I do think (and I'm not the only one, as friends of mine have told me), that some actors/actresses have been miscast. The fact that I'm not fully aware of all the H. Hughes stories shouldn't make a difference in my viewing pleasure, but then again they might have made this experience a bit lighter (and heavier at the same time, because of the length) for me ... Not a bad movie/biopic by any mean, but nothing I was excited about afterwards either!
