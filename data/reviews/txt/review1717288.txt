This is a great indie film. And when I say indie, I mean true indie. Not a huge budget, big studio film with "A" list actors trying to "keep it real." More about using a clever plot device (or several) great directing and sharp acting. The script I felt was well written with several memorable lines in it. Rare these days. The humor was a bit shocking but a refreshing departure from the "safe" old used jokes of it's contemporaries. The performances were solid, skating between stylistic and realism which is a tough line to ride consistently while keeping believability, again, good directing.I enjoyed it and would definitely suggest it.
