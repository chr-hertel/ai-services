I had a chance to watch television after 2 or 3 weeks off due to travel and dealing with the day to day reality of my 2 little boys. I was not extremely excited that the only thing I could find to watch was this documentary that I had rented some time ago. Or rather my better more educated self had rented... my lazy self wanted some TV trash. I'm thrilled that I took the high road and learned a thing or two. I grew up in a household not particularly found of Catholic rituals... but due to my viewing of this documentary I now appreciate the history that is being preserved by the Vatican. I admire the staff and clergy for their resolve to carry on the traditions that have been established and found the exposure of the day to day at the Vatican really interesting. The film dragged a bit during the section on declaring Saints I would have like to see the politics behind the decisions versus so many details of the folks who were rooting for their guy.
