Obviously not to be taken very seriously (it is a comedy ;) ), this movie does make many good points, and describes fairly well the difference in how the respective genders perceive relationships - in an entertaining manner, from start to finish :) While not a movie of a grand cinematic scale (it could have been made 10 years prior to its making without much apparent difference), it sure took me by surprise. The acting is fair, the story is alright, and the documentary-comments and the weirdness in between give it that little extra to make it hilarious.

Anyone who knows what procreation is and who has a good sense of humor would definitely enjoy this movie.

I gave it 8/10 due to how original it is, how so many of the comments ring true, and for the fact that it was That entertaining.
