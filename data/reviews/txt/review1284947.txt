Oh no... It's one of those 'based on the true story' films AND a remake! So in this case, it's a "true" story based on someone else's script, which was based on a book, which was based on what two people -George and Kathy Lutz - claim is a true story (disporved as a hoax). Well, anyone familiar either with the book or with George Lutz' account of the supposed haunting at the Amityville house can tell that the film stretches even the fabricated "truth", to put it mildly. Not that there is anything wrong with dramatic or creative license, but in this case none was needed. Mr. Lutz' original account of what transpired during those spooky 28 days in the old house where DeFoe Jr. murdered his entire family is creepy enough without embellishments. The problem is that Mr.Andrew Douglas - the remake's hapless director - took the Amityville story and the original equally bad film as an excuse to aflcit us with yet another clich√©d tribute movie to various horror classics. Instead of adapting and remaking the Amityville story in a subtle and original way which would have driven home the spooky reality of its "real-life" resonance, Mr. Douglas bores the audience with one 'movie' reference after another - from blatant homage scenes to "The Shining" and "The Exorcist" to more annoying and less obvious tributes to "Poltergeist", "The Ring" and others. The result is a messy, predictable, yet-another imitation horror movie that goes nowhere. To be fair, some sections of the film work OK here and there. Ryan Reynolds who stank to high heaven in the stinker "Blade 3" delivers a good performance for what it's worth, and some of the horror set pieces are well paced and effective in themselves. But the overall result is disappointing, and it is a shame that such good material was allowed yet again to go to waste in such a way.
