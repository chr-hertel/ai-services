I watched this docudrama and wanted to know what the big deal was... sure, Clinton and his administration looked bad, then Bush and his administration took over and they made a bunch of the same mistakes! No one got off scot free! It happened, we were arrogant and thought we were untouchable! Well, we were not only touched, but had the wind knocked out of us! 

Clinton made mistakes, Bush Sr made mistakes, Reagan made mistakes and Carter REALLY made mistakes... why does anyone think our current president wouldn't make a few himself? 

It's obvious that there were a few characters that were blended together and made into one... the Donnie Wahlberg character for one. But, the basic meaning of the movie was to slap us into reality... we were hit once and could be again if we don't learn from our past mistakes!!!
