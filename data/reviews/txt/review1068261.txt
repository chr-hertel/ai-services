In my opinion - this is Cary Grant's Finest Work - and my Favourite Grant Film.

Because seeing him at his finest - the Dean of the Motion Picture Industry.

The last part of this movie - was indeed a tear jerker for me - because seeing Cary Grant wave goodbye to two children - and then getting into his car - was indeed the most powerful scene in any Cary Grant Film - Ever! I only wish that Cary Grant made at least one more film! I highly recommend this great movie to all who love great acting, great location, and great love!
