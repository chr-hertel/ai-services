I truly believed this film was gonna be better than it was... I felt disappointed with the ending and was hoping that this would end the trilogy and make for a good series... How wrong was I??? I think fans will love this and trust me I'm as hardcore as they come... I just wished they had spent more time on the characters than the gore... If you really want to watch this but have not seen one or two - i suggest you do so cause you will be in the gutter if you don't... I suppose the premise seemed good but things obviously changed as it progressed... I would recommend this and hopefully Saw 4 will be even better...

This was for the fans...
