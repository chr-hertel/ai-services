Having had a fan boy crush on Willow & with PRISON BREAK in reruns, I sampled How I Met Your Mother.

Alyson Hannigan is her usual lusty/pixie self, but it's Neil Patrick Harris as a smarmy WASP player, and possible ' second family ' son of Eddie Haskell, who warps this show past sitcom. Rest of the cast is attractive smart & quick. Though I think the writing goes for the obvious occasionally, it has a heart beneath the cleverness & pokes fun at itself too.

I am back to Prison Break for the new season. BUT soon as I can, I'll be checking in on these kids.
