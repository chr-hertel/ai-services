This is one of my favorite guilty pleasures. I saw this movie when it came out with my mom (we're both Michelle and George fans) and it's become one of my "feel good" movies, along with Sleepless in Seattle and Amelie. The film is great, with great performances, cinematography and music. It's the kind of movie that makes you feel good. I love all the things that keep happening throughout the course of the day and how Michelle keeps getting on her clothes! It's a bit like Pride and Prejudice with the dislike and banter the two lead characters. A real winner with charm and wit, that's a guaranteed smile-maker! One of the best films of 1996 and if you haven't seen it, what the heck are you waiting for?
