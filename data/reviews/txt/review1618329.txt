Warning: THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR EVERYONE (view the trailer before you attempt to watch this, you'll know if this is YOUR type of movie...lol ) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405296/trailers-screenplay-E27357-10-2

For those people who like a movie to think about afterward, this might be your type of movie. The storyline is not linear & is a bit deceptive. On the surface it appears to be a rather simple movie/cartoon about druggies & their life. 

I've seen this movie 3 times now and I find new details which become more apparent & obvious with each viewing. It's kinda like glossing over something the first time & then "REALLY" seeing what's happening upon further inspection almost like in (dare I say it), Fight Club.

This is my favorite Phillip K. Dick (Blade Runner, Minority Report, Total Recall, Paycheck) movie adaptation & I think that Richard Linklater made a great decision in rotoscoping the film. Some people have complained about it and either don't like it or feel that it's senseless to make the film seem like a cartoon. I did'nt have a problem with it, though the scramble suits are quite interesting. I thought that it added to the nuance of almost feeling like YOU the viewer are taking substance D along with the characters. Initially I rated this movie 8 out of 10 but I love it more & more with each viewing. It has high replay value (imo) and It's definitely one of my top 10 favorites ...subliminally =)
