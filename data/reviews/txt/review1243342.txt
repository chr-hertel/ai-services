After seeing this film first and then going back and watching the trailer and looking over the publicity only afterward, the only fault with this film is how it is being marketed. There's no question in my mind that people who like horror films won't like this very much because it's NOT a horror film! I would definitely put it in the suspense genre along with films like Open Water and (and I'm not sure THIS is a good thing) The Blair Witch Project. One could even make the argument that it's more similar to Deliverence than it is to films in the horror/slasher genre. If you want gore and guts, this isn't your movie but if you like a suspenseful film with a questionable amount of "true-ness" in its "based on a true story" than you should like this.
