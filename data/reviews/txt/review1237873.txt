I know this was a made for TV movie with a tiny budget but the effects still looked really cheesy in comparison to other low budget flicks. The acting was horrendous without exception. Even Kelly Hu, who is usually good eye candy and who had like 5 lines in the entire movie, was made into a simpering, lovestruck henchwoman.

It had some fairly big names, mostly past their prime, but they didn't deliver the goods.

I don't like to tell people what to see - folks should really be able to do whatever they want - but I have to make an exception this time. It is truly awful. In short, don't waste your time.

What's amazing is that a sequel is in the works.
