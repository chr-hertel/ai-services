I almost got up to ask for my money back while I was watching this movie. However, I remained there, staring as if I was watching a car wreck on the side of the road.

There were some funny bits in this: The first human nest, for example. However, that wasn't about to carry the whole movie.

The cursing every third word wasn't necessary. The female lead was cute and actually played her role rather well. The sheriff's dry, almost bored, humor was realistic. Again, it wasn't enough to make up for the whole movie. At least she has the recurring role in the SpiderMan franchise.

If you must see one stinker for 2006, it might as well be this. The producers can be glad that Brokeback Mountain was released in 2005. That way Slither has no competition for the stinker award.
