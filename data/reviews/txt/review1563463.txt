Replacing Trademark was a stupid stupid stupid thing to do, I hope someone looses their job at the network for being a nitwit! I have tried several times to watch the new shows/crews but I am just not able to relate to either one. I stumbled onto the first Flip This House Season by accident and was hooked from the first time I watched it. They actually showed real people screwing up and being human, along with giving back to the community and being nice-what was wrong w/that? Someone please explain it? 

I thought maybe they were just getting another crew in to help out-show different regions-not replace our Trademark people! I am glad that Richard isn't taking this lightly (does he ever ?? hehehe). My Sunday's were planned around this show-- I HAD TO WATCH IT-now not only did they replace our crew from NC-A&E has changed the schedule!
