Whether you were the jock, rich kid, social butterfly, nobody, or outcast; whether you were foaming at the mouth with school spirit or couldn't wait to skip town for college, city life, or anything else; whether you long to be a child again or still can't wait to grow up: "Beautiful Girls" will touch a nerve, strike a chord, and ultimately warm your heart. While most of the members of this terrific ensemble cast brilliantly take on the traditional roles of high school melodrama -- from love affairs to street fights -- Timothy Hutton, Uma Thurman, and Natalie Portman give perspective to the inherent difficulties we have reconciling love and friendship, growing up and settling down, and wanting to put yourself in someone else's shoes.

Hutton returns to his small hometown for a ten-year high school reunion to dredge up fond memories, but he also inevitably remembers why he left. He quickly develops love affairs of the mind with Thurman, a beautiful and mysterious visitor who he easily could have fallen for under different circumstances, and Portman, the precocious child next door who, desperately wanting to grow up, falls for him. These short-lived relationships provide simple, poignant, relevant insights as the trio struggles on different levels with what it means to be in love and whether or not the grass is always greener. And even if we assume the worst, at least we can always count on old friends for a good time.

Nostalgia runs amok in this undervalued triumph of a feel-good flick. You'll find yourself wanting to call an old friend, head out to the neighborhood bar, and find "Sweet Caroline" on the jukebox play list.
