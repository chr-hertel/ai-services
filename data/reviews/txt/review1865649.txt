A quick flip through the network channels on any given weeknight is a stroll through a gallery of bloody murders, shaky camera work, and crying people dealing with horrible consequences to stupid actions. "Eli Stone" is a welcome relief, specializing in lovable characters, amusing visual effects, and a conspicuous lack of gory flesh wounds. After you have finished watching an episode, the viewer will realize that the show also included ethical questions, and very real discussions about very difficult current issues--presented in a manner far more engaging than that of your local NPR station (no offense...).

If you, like me, are hooked by the controversial pilot episode, make the effort to watch the entire season before watching the season finale. You will have been entertained, and--surprisingly in the current television "wasteland"--you will have learned something about the people around you in the United States of America.
