It looks like this is dividing opinions sharply. I'm coming down very heavily on the "sci-fi classic" side of the argument, indeed I think it's better than Close Encounters. It's one of those films where you come out of the theatre and want to get straight back in again, like a filmic roller coaster.

I just DO NOT UNDERSTAND how people can come out of the theatre saying bad things about it. No plot?!!! You have got to be kidding! I wonder what these people actually want from their movies.

Tom Cruise's acting is the best it's ever been and the two young co-stars are both outstanding. The effects are awesome except for one early scene which really does look like a two-foot high model from a B-movie. The tension is maintained throughout and - rare for Spielberg - there's not too much mush. One of our national papers in Britain has called it the best sci-fi of all time. It's got to be close. (Unless you call 'Contact' a sci-fi - that would win hands down.) What is wrong with you 1 out of 10 ers?!!!!!
