I don't know how it happened, but sometime over the last few years it seems that everyone expects perfection in movies. If people criticized and reviewed the work done by politicians at the same intensity as they rate movies, perhaps we'd be better for it.

Anyway, on to Fantastic Four. I must admit it's a solid movie. It's simple. It's direct. And it doesn't suck (unlike this review).

What do you expect? It's not a performance movie, it's not a character driven movie and it certainly doesn't hold any plot above the standard superhero comic adaptations. Take it as it is - and for the type of movie it is, it did a pretty good job. If you don't even like the genre, why are you complaining it's a bad movie? It's for the fans, by fans, and it delivers.
