"A woman and her boyfriend return to her ancestral home for the reading of her father's will. They arrive at the old mansion, during a storm, to be greeted by her strange uncle and a house full of suspicious characters. It appears that she will be the next victim of the killer and is to be murdered at the hands of a gorilla," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. 

Among the suspects, sensitive Mischa Auer (as Hanns Krug) is most fun to watch. Mother Martha Mattox (as Mrs. Krug) is another attraction; she was in "The Cat and the Canary", which effectively spoofed this genre. Unfortunately billed as "Sleep n' Eat", Willie Best (as Exodus) is offensively compared to gorilla, which look like his grandfather. Sy Tomashoff and "Dark Shadows" fans should be interested in the set production.
