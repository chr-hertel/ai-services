Alpha Dog (2006, Dir. Nick Cassavetes) 

Johnny Truelove (Hirsch) likes to see himself as tough. He's the son of an underworld figure (Willis) and a drug dealer. Johnny also likes to get tough when things don't go his way. When Jake Mazursky (Foster) fails to pay up for Johnny, things get worse for the Mazursky family, as Johnny and his 'gang' kidnap Jake's 15 year old brother (Yelchin) and holds him hostage. Problem now is what to do with 'stolen boy?'

Well built characters and an emotional storyline helps creates an entertaining drama, with wonderful performances by all of it young cast.
