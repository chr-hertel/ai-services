Main characters: Fievel Mouskewitz, Tanya Mouskewitz, papa, mamma and the baby Mouskewitz, Tony and Tiger. 

What happens: A family of five mice, mamma, papa, Fievel, Tanya and "the baby" (who doesn't appear to have a name), find their home burnt from fire by invaders. They know they are not safe in their home in Russia and in Germany, take a boat trip to America. On the way, something rather unfortunate happens to little FievelÂ…

My thoughts: Don Bluth has triumphed many a time for the public, but I think this is my favourite film animated by him, apart from "All Dogs Go To Heaven" which appeared later. He made non-Disney animation proud of itself, as beforehand I think Disney was better and more popular than any other cartoon film company until "The Secret Of Nimh" came along, also directed by Don Bluth (actually I think he did two short films which weren't Disney before that including one I like called "Banjo The Woodpile Cat" but they weren't true motion picture films). I love his animation and style and I love most of the films he has helped with very much! :-)

About the film, I love the way it warms your heart with the storyline, the cute and sometimes crafty characters and the lovely animation. It is also emotional. It makes you feel happy, but not depressed and it makes you happy, but not delirious. I like that. It it balances happiness, sadness, anger and fear without creating too much of any one of them. 

I wonder what inspired Steven Spielberg to make this film, it isn't based on a book, yet it's SO good! 

Recommended to: People who like mice, cute animated films, films with a balanced amount of emotions and films where everything isn't completely obvious! Enjoy! :-)
