On a budget of $120 million, Hulk (2003) made $132 million. This makes me wonder, does this lower the bar for the box office expectations of the new Incredible Hulk movie, coming out in 2008. But first, I recommend you see this Hulk, in a different universe and starring Eric Bana, so you can compare the two. This Hulk is actually very good and was better than I had expected. But did its flaws really weigh it down?

If you've read the comic book series, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, you know the story - otherwise, I can't say much more. But it seems to play the typical mutation in comics, caused by a gamma ray experiment. The creation is the "Incredible Hulk" - a giant, green, muscle-bound creation of pure surprise and unexpectedness. As you've probably heard before, you won't like him when he's angry. I can't guarantee you'll like the movie either (a lot of people didn't) but the CGI animators were at the top of their game making this movie. And director Ang Lee won't be recognized for this film a lot in regards to his own work, but his own touch is clearly in the film, and you know what that means: greatness.

So, if you're checking out the new Hulk movie, try to at least rent this movie first. There's no saying you'll be glad you did, as many people didn't see that. But in my opinion it was a good movie, and worthy of a big old HULK-SMASH!
