My summary pretty much sums it up...this is probably the most disjointed poorly written, poorly edited and poorly acted movie i've seen in years. I mean we all expect Tara Reed to suck, i doubt she has a brain cell left after all of her years of abuse... Dorff and slater blew chunks in the acting department as well... They should all hang their heads with shame. The only reason i saw this 2 hour long experiment in viewing pain is i had free tickets...all i can say is i want my money back! So to sum it up please save yourself and your love ones the pain and anguish that myself and a friend had to endure. Most shitty movies might be rentals, this one doesn't even qualify as an accidental watch. You know when your flipping around on the tube late at night and you happen across it playing. It's complete crappity crap crap..er crap.
