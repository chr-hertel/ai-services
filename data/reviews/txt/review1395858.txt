Wow! Sex, drugs, rock 'n roll plus murder all taking place in the sixties with hooters - what more do you need? Russ Meyer, father of legitimizing soft porn, makes his debut ( and last) big budget studio movie. And Roger Ebert, of all people, wrote the script. The production values are above par. None of the plot is very credible, but somehow manages to capture the spirit of the swinging sixties, the sexual revolution and the beginning of the demise of this era a la Manson type tragedy. The amateur actors are best served by Russ Meyer's editing so you don't really see how unskilled they are. This whole thing somehow works especially now in retrospect. In sum it's a comedy, a parody - an over the top spoof. So sit back, maybe take a toke and enjoy this hoot with hooters.
