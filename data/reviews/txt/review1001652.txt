Tim, who lives in West-Germany, has a complicated relation with his rich parents, but he loves girls and they love him. In the club he favors sweet drinks with umbrellas that he drink in the company of his loyal and less popular skanks. The year is 1975, and Tim just won a Tennis heat that gave him a stipendiary to go to Florida. Tims dad does not like the idea of his son being a tennis champion. He would rather have a smart son who took care of his company.

On a field trip to East, Tim suddenly meets his twin brother. Tim brags about his rich life and luxury. His brother Rennie takes his chance and knocks Tim unconscious, cuts his hair off and takes his place on the bus back to the West. Tim, angry and lost, must now live his brothers life, every day, and his brat lifestyle brings him a lot of problems on the way. But in the darkest hour, there's light - the girl.
