I still remember this movie and I must have seen it when I was about 4 years old. I'm now 17! How's that for being memorable? I admit that I haven't read the book even now, though I have read Great Expectations so it can't be said I don't respect Charles Dickens. People shouldn't rate this movie so hard if one, you're not a child, and two if you are a hardcore fan of the book. Anyways.. I just thought I'd get that out of my system and if anybody knows where I can possibly buy the DVD please let me know! Also, I should let some of you fans out there know that the picture they have for this movie isn't from the movie as we can all remember it involved cats and monkeys, not people.
