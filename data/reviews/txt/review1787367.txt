The duet of Tim Burton & Johnny Depp is always a pleasure to behold. Unfortunately, this time the creepy fairy tale for adults has gone too far with superfluous gore, blood, and neck-slashing. Wonderful cinematography, spectacular costumes and strong acting in the first part of the movie are eclipsed by the fountains of blood in the second half. The gore is hardly necessary, as it doesn't add anything to the movie, but it seriously detracts. More than once, we found ourselves turning our heads away from close-up shots of necks slit open by a razor, and with each time we were less inclined to look back at the screen. It's sad to see an old master like Burton caving in to what appears to be the norm in Hollywood with respect to graphic violence and high body count.
