Earnest, amateurish. I got about 6 minutes into it and had to give up. Classic moments from those ten mins: the closeup like an arrow on a goodbye note, followed closely by a "perils of alcoholism" zoom through a wineglass; the complete and fantastically impossible total mute of party noise when "I wrote this for you" guy leaves a door ajar, and the canned sentimental piano music which swells up in the scene which ensues.

That's where I bailed.

One wonders if this is a film-school project which garnered affection and support. At any rate, as of this writing there are no 'external reviews' for this release: that says something.
