I didn't like the movie at all, it's just a sloppy remake from the Chinese movie :Infernal Affairs from 2002.And the all star cast don't change nothing about it,the original is so much more in all aspects.I saw the original like two years ago and was so overwhelmed by the story,and by the way the cast acted.I became an immediate fan of the movie,and now two years later Ã­ was confronted with this Hollywood knockoff.And was very disappointed about it Mr Scorsese just took all the Chinese elements out and replaced it for western crap that doesn't make it automatically a good movie only because of the story & the cast.
