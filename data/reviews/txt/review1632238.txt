Directed by Renny Harlin (A Nightmare on Elm Street 4:The Dream Master, Cliffhanger, Cutthroat Island) made an extremely entertaining action film that knows how to thrill the audiences. But unfortunately this movie was an box office disappointment, due of a bad release date. But like most films, it did find life on video. The plot might seems hokey and far fetched for some tastes but Shane Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout) script does work well enough to overcome certain flaws. This has some of the most spectacular action sequences ever filmed. This has an terrific score by Alan Silvestri (Back to the Future Trilogy, Forrest Gump, Predator) and Dazzling Visual Effects. A must for action fans. Larry King plays himself in a cameo near the closing credits. Super 35. (****/*****).
