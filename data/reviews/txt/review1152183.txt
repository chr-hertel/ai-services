I thought i had seen all the cult films that were out there until i picked this up. At first i was a little disappointed but then that quickly changed! This is now the best one i've seen! never a dull moment after the first few minutes. I totally recommend this film if like me, are planning to pursue a independent film-making career! 10 out of 10!
