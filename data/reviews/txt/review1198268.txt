More than simply a cops-and-robbers story, "Heat" allows us to understand the characters more than the average crime story. In the first place, Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) and thief Neil McCauley (Robert DeNiro) are good friends before they realize that they have to be enemies. And even when it becomes clear to them that they're on opposite sides of the law, the viewer still can sympathize with both men: we understand that McCauley doesn't want to be a criminal but has no choice, and we understand that Hanna finds law enforcement unpleasant but is trapped in his position. Never going overboard on violence or degenerating into silliness, "Heat" is a modern classic and a triumph for all involved. It was, in my opinion, director Michael Mann's best movie ever, and a very interesting look at Los Angeles. This is one movie that won't disappoint you.
