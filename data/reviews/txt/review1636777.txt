Wow, what a piece of anti-Protestant propaganda this turned out to be. I was shocked, first of all, to see atheist Katharine Hepburn playing a praying Catholic (actors are prostitutes; they'll play any role if the money is right. Hepburn and Tracy proved that way back). "Mary" was praying for guidance. That was fine, even refreshing to see her play that kind of role, to be honest.

However, once "Mary, Queen of Scots" arrives in Scotland and encounters John Knox, the Scottish Protestant reformer, we see the bias. Knox is portrayed as some shouting, wild-man lunatic! Sorry, but that's so typical of the film world....even back in the classic film days where Catholic priests/nuns were all portrayed as lovable and beautiful people by the likes of Bing Crosby, Ingrid Bergman, Tracy, Loretta Young, etc. but Protestants did not receive the same treatment...and never have. Of course, nowadays Hollywood is unrelenting in bashing both groups, particularly Catholics.

Nevertheless, this film is really biased toward Hepburn's character, and too prejudiced for me. Even with no bias, at 123 minutes this film was too boring - a sin to every movie-goer!
