About 5 mins into this movie I dreaded any further interaction between the two main characters. The dialog was plausible and believable but the acting was akin to watching gazelles being chased down and ripped to shreds by lions. Yes, you continue to watch, but yet part of you feels guilt and remorse for doing so. 

When the actor that is the most believable as their character is a city buildings inspector (No spoiler there-it's known from the get-go) that is only a bit-part (famous actors refer to them as cameos!) you know someone in casting is keenly familiar with the term 'Head Trauma'.

Good to kill some time but only if you want to sit around by yourself and not have to wait for your friends to deride you for suggesting to give this movie a try.

Giving this movie anything above a 3-5 is misguided generosity.
