Certain reviews (not on this website) misled me about this film and so I was expecting a great concert of up-tempo Gospel music. That's what I got it for - the music. The advertisement said, "jubilant, revitalizing musical."

Well, there are songs in here but they don't last long. Mostly, this is a documentary on Willie Mae Ford Smith and Tomas A. Dorsey, pioneers in black gospel music. They are wonderful people - solid Christians - but the documentary, quite frankly, is boring. 

If one is a big fan of these two, it might be a jewel, but to fans who simply want a concert of gospel music, this isn't it.
