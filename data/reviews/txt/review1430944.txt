This is an outstanding and fascinating documentary that chronicles the previously untold challenges the Apollo 11 Astronauts and Mission Control colleagues faced and overcame to successfully fulfill President Kennedy's vision of landing and returning men safely from the moon. Obstacles such as: communication breakdowns, computer malfunctions, broken circuit board to launch the Lunar Lander off the moon (fixed by a ball point pen), low fuel, and perhaps the most incredible revelation was Buzz Aldrin talking about their craft being trailed by a UFO.

The program contains some wonderful color footage of the Apollo program, gripping first-person accounts from Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, Mission Control Flight Director Gene Kranz, as well as others instrumental to the successful Apollo 11 mission. To underscore the real risks and dangers facing the astronauts who were using a Lunar Lander (whose engine was only fully operational 50% of the time during previous space tests) the documentary illuminates the draft of President Nixon's memorial speech should the Astronauts be unable to leave the moon's surface.

Anyone interested in the history of America's space program or who revels in humanity's ingenuity and spirit to triumph in the face of seeming insurmountable obstacles should enjoy this feature.
