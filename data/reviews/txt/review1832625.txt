There are at least a few moments in "Suffocation" at which I literally jumped in my chair. Unfortunately, these were all related to the soundtrack, which can be quite jarring. In fact, I stopped the DVD twice simply to back up and see why the musical director had inserted a particularly loud chord at those spots. In both cases, it was apparently just an effort to generate tension, as nothing much was actually happening on-screen.

The cinematography is not bad and the ghost/non-ghost is done fairly well, but the overall effect is more stylish than scary. The underwater scenes, for example, look like they were shot in a pool (which they undoubtedly were) and a lot of the night scenes are too cleverly lit for their own good. The film is also poorly-paced, with no sense of momentum.

Overall, this is a fairly creepy film, but it's not what many audiences expect when they hear "psychological horror." I recommend this movie only for those viewers who are interested in seeing something a little bit different and who feel comfortable watching flawed films for the sake of what might have been.
