Firecracker is really part tragic drama, part character study, and in many ways it is almost a supernatural fantasy film. I loved this film, initially, for the score. The music is larger-than-life.

At best, the story attains mythic proportions, but at the very least it's a parable concerning abuse and entrapment. Everyone in the story seems trapped one way or another and desperate for escape.

The film is about many things, but its sensibilities derive from an era that is barely comprehensible to contemporary film-goers. The controversy regarding the quality of the film, in my mind, makes it a kind of benchmark. People who don't like it, I don't want to know.

In dozens of ways this film has re-invented the process of making films. If you haven't seen the documentary "Wamego" that chronicles the production, you must. The making of Firecracker is profoundly and fundamentally revolutionary, revisionist and eminently worthy of study on every level.

This film is a work of art in all aspects. Of course, it's not for those looking for action; this film allows you to meet and get to know the characters. The cinematography is incredible and the score is just as good, if not better, than most studio-made epics.

Bravo! Karen Black, Best Actress winner - Fantasporto
