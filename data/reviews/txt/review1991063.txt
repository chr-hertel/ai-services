well what can i say i was recommended to watch this film and i wasn't let down what a great film I'm not really into the action type of films as they are all roughly the same storyline and the same outcome but i was pleasantly surprised with Taken as it was not just your average action movie it was much more than that if you are looking to watch a great action film then look no further than Taken it has everything you would want all thou the ending with the pop singer no one really cares about lol but i would definitely recommend this film its better than any of the transporters and to me its better than the bourne series give it a watch and you wont be let down
