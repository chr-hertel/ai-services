Okay, this is my story. My girl and I read the book and I promised her to go to Da Vinci with her. we would go on a Saturday. But on the Thursday when it came out, my roommate had two tickets... I'm a movie fanatic so I thought, first see it on Thursday and keep my mouth shut about it.

spoilers:

THURSDAY: My god what a drag. It took so long. I loved the Louvre scenes, loved the Teabing mansion scenes but after that, the story was ripped apart. Some lines were B-level and my biggest problem was that when Langdon had to solve a code, I couldn't follow it. There was too much info and the hints flew by to quickly. When Langdon cracked the APPLE-code, I just couldn't figure out how the hell he found that out. And after that when Teabing was taken by the cops (which was more hideous to see than looking at Tom Cruises big smile), I lost the plot, I couldn't care anymore.

5/10

I thought please NO, not again on Saturday, KILL ME.

Saturday: Sat there acting surprised next to my girl, who was so eager to see it. But than it happened! Knowing the plot, knowing the riddle answers,, seeing the hints as they occurred on screen immediately as they were spoken out loud, the movie gets to you. You hear every single bit of information. You hear the complete 'history' lesson. And it was then, after seeing five hours of Hangs and the beautiful Tattou, that I got goosebumps when Ron Howard showed Mary M to the audience.

So here's the advice to you all, When the first time you saw it, the movie seemed lame and too far stretched out, see it again, sure, there are some crappy scenes (IM YOUR GRANDMOTHER), but they HAD to be put in there. But when you follow the story word to word, you solve all the mysteries that puzzled you the first time you saw it...

9/10
