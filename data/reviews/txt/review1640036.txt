This flashily photographed and edited film sort of sounds good when you talk about it: the ultimate French New Wave rip off with a comic book existential "plot" and a heaping helping of self indulgence all around. 

Enduring the film, which I saw today with a mint print, is alas another story. Beatty, a sometimes underrated and effective actor, is utterly at a loss trying to carry this charmless and senseless film. Penn and Beatty learned a few things here, but in Bonnie and Clyde they were applying them to the service of a story.

Film fans may want to seek out "Mickey One" for it's general weirdness, but don't expect to like it much. Just because the basic idea is vague, doesn't mean every scene has to meander. Any episode of "The Prisoner" did the Kafka thing, but with humor and cleverness to keep your interest in the ideas. 

Some interesting location work in a very different looking Chicago that might be interest to locals, too bad you have to watch the movie.
