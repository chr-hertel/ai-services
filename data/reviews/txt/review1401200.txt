While graphically amazing, the story never held my interest and I found the humor lacking. It had style but VERY little substance with a forced morality lesson in tow.

I really don't understand why everyone was so jazzed about this movie. Maybe they were voting based on how well their kids liked it. As an adult, I was personally rather bored.

I only gave it a 5 because of the technical wizardy of the CG.

Well, since I'm forced to put in at least 10 lines, I'll also say that Ray Romano is talentless and continues to play the same character no matter what he does. He's even worse than Kevin Costner and Nicolas Cage.
