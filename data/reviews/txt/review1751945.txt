I am a movie bug and love watching good movies, and i must tell you most of the time its Hollywood flicks.But,i am also an avid supporter of my country.One of the best of things this country has produced over the least decade is the movie CINTA. A truly amazing spectacle backed by a rich display of our culture, divine music by Zainal Abidin and an array of world class actors to act out the theme, LOVE.Its a movie which will put love in your hearts and pride in mind of your country. I congratulate the cast and director for this contributing this to me and fellow country man.If i were to summarize this movie in one word, then it would have to MAGIC !!!
