Utena is a title that goes beyond an institute within the grades that put your consideration in this particular film, which I mean, There is a part where Utena took the sword chest of Anthy in the first duel; states that Utena frees Anthy from the yoke of previous sexual Winner,Saijonji.

All the characters in the film have problems related to sexuality, own adolescence: Utena has enormous emotional vacuum, which makes it sometimes confuse your feelings; Anthy feels guilty for the death of God, his brother, Akio, the degree of left manipulate and to a certain extent abuse it; Touga was a child raped by a man, Juri is a lesbian girl, repressed by society, Saionji is an inappropriate social Miki and Kozue face incestuous a problem, stemming from a possessive love; Shiori is a girl who woke up pretty soon their sexuality, and it is quite early, not to mention being by the death of his Prince and know that it is desired by another woman ... Akio is a man incomplete from the point of view inside, and looking to fill this vacuum with sex ...

Has no filler, the animation is fine, the aesthetics is surprising: the poses shadow of girls, until the color of hair and eyes of Utena have a meaning ... the movie is a journey of opium, is full of symbolism and what you suggest for "real" is not always so. Adding insult to injury is the most confusing climax scene in the entire history of anime (!). It is described as a metaphor for one must leave the comfortable but at the same time confusing world of adolescence (Represented by the school Ohtori).
