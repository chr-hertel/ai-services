I'm very irritated by this movie, and i see it as a threat to the kids today. People look up to this Barbarian and he just seems to grow in popularity. There is a very controversial series in Sweden called Meeting Malek, and that is NOTHING against this.. Why does people make movies like this, what is their thought releasing a movie like this? What does he want? I think it's this whole "Gangsterrap" situation that is inspiring people like HIM and children like mine. I can see how people would count this as a thread posted by some "Dorky sweed who can't handle some violence and harsh words" but i for one think this goes one step to far. I can't see what people find so great about this person? He is very frustrated and just swears and fights... I mean, what is this? This may not be a useful comment but at least it expresses how i feel... I have one word... Disgusting
