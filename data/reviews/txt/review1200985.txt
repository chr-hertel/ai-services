Why? I mean, why?? What a disappointment! Who in their right mind decided that Joan Hickson version of Miss Marple can be remade! Geraldine McEwan is totally wrong for the character. She looks an old sly dog sniffing out clues as oppose to the sweet fluffy old lady magnificently played by Joan Hickson which was completely true to Agatha Christie's character. The producers went out of their way to gather stars in this series. But still it has turned out a total and utter disaster IMHO. Please! Stop trying to remake a masterpiece. Especially if you are going to distort Agatha Christie's version of Miss Marple.
