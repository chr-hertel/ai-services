Dean Koontz came up with a good idea when he wrote the book this film was based on. Instead of some alien presence arriving from another planet, there is one on our own that we've been oblivious to for centuries. When the residents of Snowfield, California start mysteriously missing and dying, there turns out to be an old evil at work.

The cast includes stars like Ben Affleck, Peter O'Toole, and Liev Schreiber. Good CGI is used to give eye candy to the film. The ancient evil is an organism from beneath the earth's surface. Somehow it is able to manifest itself as apparitions. This seemed a bit far-fetched and out of place, especially since the story tries to hold true to science. As to the acting, the characters could've been a little more believable in how scared they were. I thought Scheiber's character, while deranged, was a bit funny.

"Phantoms" has a few good suspense scenes and definitely shows that a bigger production budget was used compared to your average creature feature. The ending, despite being VERY predictable, at least makes some sense. 4/10 P.S.: It's amazing what two women with shotguns can do when shooting at a monster.
