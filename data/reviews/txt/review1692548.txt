I was never a coffee fan, and then I stumbled upon the coffee episode of "Good Eats," the first episode I'd ever watched. The fast-paced format drew me in, but I stayed for all the nifty scientific and culinary facts I was learning.

After the episode "True Brew," I gave coffee another chance, and became a Good Eats fan for life. I love how, well, anal he is about good food and good cooking, and although I don't agree or follow everything he says, I did incorporate a lot of what he's said into my cooking. And I do have a stand mixer with flames painted on the side...

After five years or so of being a fan, I've tried several of the recipes from the show, and all of them come out great. Though I get better results by watching the show *and* following the written recipe.

Now that he's done an Okra episode, I've got to re-evaluate my fear of Okra, which goes way back to when they served fried, breaded okra in my North Texas cafeteria.

Darn that Alton Brown and his ability to get me to try new things!
