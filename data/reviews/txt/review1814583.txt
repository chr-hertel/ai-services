The main problem in this sort of clever thriller is: it isn't really thrilling. 

But why's that? I think there are several weak factors:

1. Sympathy for the protagonists: The time of introducing characters and building a relationship to them is too short respectively not efficiently used. You can't really know and like the family, neither understand its dynamics. Even if this is wanted by the makers, it brings you to be not very moved by the actually "thrilling moments".

2. Motivation: Point 1 implements also that you can't follow the motivation of the leading characters. This is, in part, surely necessary to heighten the suspense. But when all tricks were revealed, I still wasn't satisfied with the given answers.

3. The clever viewer: Fortunately, this movie is not predictable. But anyone with half a brain will expect some turning points and every "thriller-used" viewer can guess at some more or less particular time in which direction the resting film will go. In addition, the time and form of the turnings aren't as twisting as they should/could be.

In summary: I think in this movie a good working story was wasted by an unfinished constellation of characters and the missing insight into them.

However, my rating says it: You can enjoy watching this, and if you don't, you won't miss it.
