Simply terrible. I was cringing from the very start and had to bury my head in my heads over and over again to keep myself from vomiting. It was cheesy, predictable, and from an Asian, almost offensive. Why must Hollywood always force upon us a white lead hero (who always gets the Asian gal), despite how out of place they are in such movies. The typical racial stereotypes are only going to be perpetuated by movies like this. 

Please, if you have any interest in Asian martial artist, or Asian cinema, do yourself a favor and rent some real classics even if you have to do some extra work in reading subtitles. Highly recommended in the martial arts genre are Jet Li's Once Upon a Time series or even the more Hollywood-esquire House of Flying Daggers.
