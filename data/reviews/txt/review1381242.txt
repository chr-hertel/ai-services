I teach 5th grade and show this movie to my class every year. It moves them and shows them an important period in the history of our country. They are amazed when I tell them that this happened in America, not some other country and that we still fight for these rights on a daily basis, both in America and abroad. It makes them appreciate the civil rights all Americans are supposed to have. There are some racially inappropriate words, but that adds to the realism and sparks discussion about words as weapons. This movie goes really well with a host of books and web sites that you can look up on the internet and use with many different age levels.
