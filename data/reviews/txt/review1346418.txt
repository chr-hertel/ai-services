Notorious is one movie that do justice in every aspect .this movie grippes you from the start to the end .its a typical love story coated with extravagant specialty of Hitchcock's suspense and mystery but its for sure a mile high from Hitchcock's other triumphs , the script is magnificently written by Ben Hecht and the stardom cast really makes this movie something beyond legacy . Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant deliver one of the most prolific cinematic performances as Bergman was very much convincing as adorable young American agent and Grant was also exceptional. This movie is honored to be enlisted in criterion collection and is really a treat to watch for all but especially for Hitchcock fans!
