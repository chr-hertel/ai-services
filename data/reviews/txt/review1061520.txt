Just went to see the Pacifier with Vin Diesel. I thought this was an excellent movie- warm, funny, and very family oriented! It was charming for me to see him in a not-so-action based role, and at that, one with children! It was so cute! Especially watching his character deal with diapers! This movie also possessed a lot of versatility- it was the perfect blend of men & action, women & love/drama, and kids & values. The ultimate in family night movie compromises that everyone will like!Also, it gave a good voice to a range of living issues from dealing with peers, teachers, and children, all the way to major issues like death of a loved one, or being an orphan. This movie is both entertaining and very etiquette driven. I definitely will be buying this movie upon DVD release!
