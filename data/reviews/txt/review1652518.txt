Wow, with a combination of "western" and "comedy," I expected this to be entertaining at the very least. Well, it wasn't, despite a cast that included Glenn Ford and Henry Fonda. Well, even with "big names," there is no guarantee a film will be enjoyable.

The comedy was very weak and the storyline wasn't much: simply a bunch of aging cowboys ("bronco busters," to be exact) trying to tame horses, with one of the horses giving them a particularly hard time. Meanwhile, a couple of women harp on those guys to settle down. Halfway, through, I was bored silly. That's the main problem of this film: a weak story.

At least there were some good visuals to enjoy, mainly the wonderful background scenery. Sue Anne Langdon ("Mary") was nice on the eyes, too.

To be fair, if I could see this on 2.35:1 widecreen on DVD, I might change my opinion on the photography alone.
