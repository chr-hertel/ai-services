I think this movie is great. It is very funny and i would recommend you if you haven't seen it to watch it. It is a great movie for teenagers or a bit older. Even though it is rated MA 15+ its not that rude, i meen there's nudity and swear words but I'm only 15 and i thought it was good. So if you like funny humorous movies i think this movie would be for you. I liked this movie because it was funny of course but it was also good how the writers made it smart in a way how they went all over Europe. I cant say what happens so i encourage people to buy it if you haven't seen it and even if you have seen it by renting it you should buy it or watch it again thats what i have done i have watched it like 10 times and its still really good.
