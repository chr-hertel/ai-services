This is the greatest movie i have ever seen, i loved the original ever since i was a kid and when i found out that this was coming out i started a count down and put it on my calender, and it was worth it. Naomi watts did an exceptional job, she was so great she made the movie full of emotion.i never thought jack black could say the infamous line at the end so serious but he did, and it was great.But my favorite actor in that movie would have to be Andy Serkis with his amazing likeness to a real gorilla, he went out and studied them in the wild, it was great.

but i am now really looking forward to the two sequels coming out this year, son of Kong in June, and Kong into the wolfs layer, in December.
