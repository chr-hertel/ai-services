To really enjoy this amazing film, you need to be a fan of the series. There has been a lot of mixed reviews, they love it and hate it. Really it's Indy meets the new technology. And the overall look is gorgeous. And the storyline, is...well as good as it gets. Some people think its stupid, others think it's amazing. And some thought it was a necessity. I was one of them. This story separates the film from the rest but yet still, it is a true Indy film. And as for the cast, Ford, Allen, and LaBeouf pulled it off. Visual Effects were incredible, not too cheesy at all. And Ford can easily be said that he still kicks a**. Which just made the film even better. Indy 5? Maybe, but I know Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is being saved in the classics cabinet.
