This movie reminded me with star wars Episode 1 specially that Liam Neeson is already the instructor here

But let's start by saying that Batman Begins is a very well organized movie, it takes us from the very first beginning of the character of Bruce Wayne the factors that led him to take the way of batman and specially why the bat

the movie takes attention from the very beginning of it it is not just a simple movie, it needs concentration to follow the running events I liked the story from how Bruce was a kid and how he is afraid of bats and when he grows up and starts learning the ways of Ninja and so

the training was cool but I didn't like the shooting of it the camera was so close that I can't tell who is attacking who

the story line is very well made why choose the bat, the car, the costume and such stuff

Liam Neeson is a very talented actor I liked his role although it has same character lines as in Kingdom of heaven and in Star wars, and some how schindler list. finally i can say it is a very well served movie
