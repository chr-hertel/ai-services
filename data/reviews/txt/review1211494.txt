I saw a "Sneak Preview" of "Dangerous Beauty" last night as I had no interest in the Olympics that everyone else was watching on TV. 

It's a fun romantic romp, not very deep, despite the veneer of feminism, sort of a serious "Gigi" without the music, originally titled "Courtesan" but TPTB were afraid no one would know what that was.

It's a costume drama with (female) nudity and four letter words, gee just like they must have spoken if they spoke English in Venice.

The sets were obviously mattes, but quite pretty.

I've liked Rufus Sewall since "Middlemarch" on "Masterpiece Theatre."

Jaqueline Bisset makes a grande older dame, and her comments about her conquests when young have a nice resonance with real life.

Some actors who don't usually get to don corset and hose get to dress up, like Fred Ward, Justine Miceli, and Moira Kelley, and are surprisingly good at it. 

But the movie is basically the lead woman as she's in every scene and Catherine McCormick is quite captivating.
