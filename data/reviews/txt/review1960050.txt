What i loved about this film is that it brings up a seldom talked about super sports hero.Ernie's astounding football talent was well known to fans of his era.He died so young before football really exploded on TV.. Ernie never got his chance to be a Pro football highlight that he was destined to become.He was the guy breaking the legendary Jim Brown records at Syracuse & helping the Orangeman to their first National football title.All this with a backdrop of the segregationist times. About 20 years ago on a visit to Mark Twain's gravesite in Elmira, New York i decided to look over other graves in the cemetery.I came across Ernie's grave about a 100 yards from Mark Twain's & memories of his career & death came over me.I love this movie because I witnessed the greatness & tragedy of Ernie,when I was a young sports fan.This movie is a credit to Ernie & his life.One commenter from Elmira complained that more of the movie should have been in Elmira.I agree, because the heart & soul of Ernie's football was in Elmira..But I also understand that movies are not always done on location.Whatever constraints the production company had in the making of this movie ,it was still very well done.I personally am shedding a tear for Ernie as I write this.May the legend of Ernie become more of a sports lore then what has been overlooked for decades..Ernie deserves it!
