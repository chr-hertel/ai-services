Fogged-in British airport is besieged with a collection of characters awaiting their respective flights. Not a good idea for a movie--not even for a soap opera--though it does give Supporting Oscar winner Margaret Rutherford a jaunty opportunity to kick up her heels as a befuddled Duchess, and Orson Welles nearly steals the show as an egotistical filmmaker. Reteaming of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton post-"Cleopatra" doesn't ignite sparks, but they are gorgeous together. Polished production does pick up after a slow start; it's professional but inert, and mostly unexciting. Directed by Anthony Asquith, who might've been dozing behind the camera. ** from ****
