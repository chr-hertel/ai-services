The credits begin rolling, the lights remain low. No-one hears the usual sounds of people getting up or dropping their popcorn bags and soda cups on the floor. No-one tells his wife he'll meet her outside the men's room. Everyone just sits there. Very little conversation. Nearby you hear someone sobbing. Over there too. A rather large man with a stunned look on his face, and tears streaming down it, quietly repeats "I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry." Who cares about the Oscars? Because of this presentation I just might make it to Heaven.

This does not just wring the emotions, though it does do that. You have to concentrate. Pay attention! You feel the pain, but you also come to know the why of it. You are well aware of the players. You know the plot. Now you know what happened, not from reading about it, but from being there.

Don't say "Hooray!" Say "Alleluia!"
