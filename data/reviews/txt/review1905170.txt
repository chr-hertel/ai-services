Does it make sense? Of Course not. Terrible story, acting, special effects, plot holes, and plane impossible situations (I'm looking at you Flying Guillotine)? Yes! But The Machine Girl has one core element that will drag anyone in; and that's pure Fun. Fun with a capital F, this movie is absolutely a blast.

I watched the film last night after a Independence Day party, and I was not expecting the fun we had. After arguing over English Dubbings or not, we decided that it would only add to the hilarity. We were right. With well placed comical lines, awkward and impossible situations, and a load of gore The Machine Girl in no way fails to deliver.

The Machine Girl doesn't take itself seriously(for our sake), but does not fail to give a killer storyline full of fun. I strongly suggest a bowl of chips, a room of friends, a good sense of humor, and some English Dubbings and I promise this movie will deliver.

A solid 9.2/10 for a ton of fun.
