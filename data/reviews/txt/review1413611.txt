i know a one is a little low.. but now exactly for this movie... i am not under rating it in the least, it was horrible, i did not believe for one minute on any of it, th plot was week, and there wasn't anything to it... it was the biggest waste of life..who wants to see a movie with poor acting, no plot as well as nothing good about it? i totally do not recommend this to anyone.. not even if you are bored.. if you want to watch a good movie about the mentally retarded watch I Am Sam.. i great movie with good acting but i tell you folks Do Not watch this.. i warn you it will most likely anger you...like it had angered me, well thats all i had to say.
