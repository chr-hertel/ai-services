I just read a review on IMDb praising this movie, and I couldn't believe what I was reading. This run of the mill movie contains cliché after cliché, though this critic said, "still far better than most of the cliché-ridden dreck that passes for horror", so I'm thinking either someone close to the production is spooning with these critics, or I'm not sure, because this horror movie drained the plot from three similar movies that previously came out. I'm not going to jog my memory to recycle the structure or antics of the characters with in the plot, but let me tell you, nothing UNIQUE, INSPIRED, or NOTEWORTHY comes from this boring and easily produced horror flick. GO GET AN IMAGINATION--then you can be a critic that approves of garbage.
