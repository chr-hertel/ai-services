This is a decidedly dated wartime comedy filled with tons of stilted, unfunny dialog. Poor Bogey is forced to utter lines which would sound better coming from the likes of his sidekicks, comics such as Phil Silvers and William Demarest. Overall, their approach contrasts oddly with the acting styles of the bad guys (the Nazi sympathizers played by Peter Lorre, Conrad Veidt and Judith Anderson) who play it completely straight, (as befits their villain status). One can almost see the US flag waving over every scene, and a giant war bond ad is practically plastered over the whole picture. Not that the Americans weren't the heroes of this piece, mind you, this just doesn't make for a very convincing story. Bogart, to his credit, handles the proceedings with a completely straight face--a difficult task when one is faced with such ridiculous, jingoistic lines (I wish I could remember some of them for a good quote, but I guess they didn't make that much of an impression). The keystone cops style chase scenes are rather amusing in places, so this gets a 4 out of 10 for that.
