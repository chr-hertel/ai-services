There's a lot to like about this fun flick based on the popular cartoon and toy series. It's a surprisingly entertaining movie that delivers plenty of enjoyable escapism. Dolph Lundgren as He-man was a fun casting choice. He certainly looks the part! My favorite part of the movie is the evil Skeletor. He's awesome! Frank Langella was a perfect choice! He's extremely enjoyably EVIL in every scene he's in! It's great stuff! Like He-Man? Give this flick a try. Pick up the new "Best Of" Masters of the Universe animated DVD too. You can't beat the fun of He-Man on DVD if you "get" this sort of thing. I've had a blast watching the movie and the cartoon. Good fun!
