I can't believe that I watched this movie, but the sad fact is that I did. I ignored the warnings of IMDb and the bottom 100, and decided to actually give a "Larry the Cable Guy" movie a shot. Boy, was I sorry.

This film doesn't actually have a plot. It's just Larry the Cable Guy, Dj Quails, and 2 other actors doing a 4 man comedy show, who happen to be in the military and in Mexico. "Delta Farce" is overrun with jokes that are downright embarrassing. This is the kind of stuff where, a bush-league newbie comedian goes on stage for the first time and gets crickets. I felt genuinely embarrassed for whoever wrote this movie, and would advise them to take the "sue for name removal" route immediately.

Secondly, "Delta Farce" was stupidly unbelievable and ridden with clich√©s. For example, Keith David calls the men "maggots" in R. Lee Ermey fashion, and orders them to go to Iraq. Another dumb moment was the very fact that Marisol Nichols was in the movie, with makeup all done and perfect hair, with the rest of the village looking weathered and primitive. That wasn't the first, "man, this is stupid" moment, but it doesn't help you escape from the fact that you're watching a Larry The Cable Guy movie.

So, upon watching this garbage halfway through, I aborted my viewing mission, and left men behind; especially Larry the Cable Guy who should never star in a movie again. I'll probably work on humanitarian missions next, like advising other people to never watch this piece of crap again.
