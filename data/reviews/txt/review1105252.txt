This is a good Batman movie compared to the rest, even Tim Burton's in my opinion.

Good - decent to good story, nice overall Batman feeling Bad - Wish the setting could have more of the ART DECO (past, future, post modern) feeling which goes well with Batman. I didn't like the Commissioner Gordon character, he seemed too weak and stupid, seemed to be lacking something that was Gordon, but thats just my opinion. I also didn't like his sidekick, I think the Batman from the animated series Gordon had a much better partner.

Ugly - The fight scenes were horrible, like many people have mentioned, extremely tight shots you can't even see what the heck is going on. Not choreographed well, it gave me feeling that the actors didn't know how to fight so they shot close to give a fighting illusion. An excuse for this could be that they wanted to shoot the action sequences like that to portray Batman has a swift, shadow ninja like fighter. The vehicle used for Batman in this movie just didn't cut it for me. It seemed to be too chunky for my taste, but it can also be that I'am too use to the original Batman movie batmobile, which was slick and sexy in my opinion.

Overall - This was decent action, batman movie. Overall good comic book movie compared to other ones released. It is worth watching right now compared to all the other movies out there. As of right now, Batman is best action movie out for summer, watch this if you are in mood for serious action movie. But watch Mr. Mrs Smith if you are in for action/comedy! Hope this review helps! By the way man oh man the ending in Batman Begins is good! hahaha I can't wait for the sequel!!
