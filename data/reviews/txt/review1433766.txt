Flip this house was an awesome show! I was really impressed with Richard, Ginger and the team as they bought these houses and rehabbed them. I'm in the real estate biz - and it can be even more cut throat than Hollywood. But one of the draws the show had was the family type atmosphere they seemed to do business with. Sure - they had their knock down drag out fights - but that's family ;) Of course, it doesn't hurt that Ginger is so cute ;) Then there was the extra mile they would go - to rehab a house and sell it back to the guy, to invite the previous owners over to see what they did. A&E has ruined the essence of the show by changing teams. I thought flip this house was trademark properties and I was disappointed to see another company this season. If Trademark shows up somewhere else - I'll be sure to watch that show! Especially if Ginger is there ;)
