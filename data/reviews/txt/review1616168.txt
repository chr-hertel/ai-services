Greetings again from the darkness. Another in the series of Christian message films, this one based on Jim Stovall's best selling book of the same name. With the overall look and feel of a Lifetime Channel movie, James Garner, Bill Cobbs and Lee Meriweither add enough class and talent to make it watchable and, at times, effective.

Little known Drew Fuller stars as Jason, the spoiled, unappreciative grandson of the recently departed billionaire James Garner. Giving dysfunctional families everywhere an example of what can happen, Garner's family bickers and threatens lawsuits over his will and what they perceive as shortchanging of their fair share. Long estranged from his grandfather, Jason is certainly put out by the tests he is forced to endure for his unknown share of the estate. Of course, the tests are designed by Garner to teach Jason the real meaning of life and to help him find his lost soul.

The best scenes of the film involve Abigail Breslin (so dynamic in "Little Miss Sunshine") as a dying girl who is very concerned about leaving her mother alone in the world. Breslin's character has a lot to do with Jason's meandering path to salvation.

With the exception of Drew Fuller (who is a poor man's Robbie Benson) and most of the family, the cast does a pretty decent job of playing the script straight. Brian Dennehy, Cobbs and a radiant 72 yr old Lee Meriwether (Catwoman from the first "Batman" movie in the 60's and a former Miss America) are all solid in their support work and manage to boost the film just enough to prevent that slide into pure hokey muck.

Not pretending to be anything but what it is, just know this is a message film and one designed to get us to look at ourselves.
