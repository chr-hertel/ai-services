Despite what critics say, this movie is amazing in it's own wright. The special effects were quite good for the time it was made, the acting was amazing even if this sequel is just a tie-in to the original story. The characters like Superman and Nuclear Man are not disappointing at all. The movie although offers a little story it's good because if you're an all action film fan than this film is for you since most of the story is about Superman fighting Nuclearman in several climatic battles across the world and even on the moon. It's a shame that not to many think so and besides this Superman film is an environmental film ifyou consider all of the nuclear talk here. We need to consider that this movie was produced in 1987. Cristopher Reever was an outstandingactor. There are only a few flaws on this film but trust me that you will love this movie.
