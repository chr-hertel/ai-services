wow... i said it before and i'll say it again...the Germans makes dramas as no one else.. I'm not gonna be long-winded here, but for those who like German dramas this one for sure is a top 5, a well deserved spot among films like: Der krieger und die keiserin, das weisse rauschen, I'm juli, gegend die wand and so on... Although this is a movie about being young, having ideals and following them, u don't have to be alike to follow along... this movie will touch everyone, at least if u are one of those who can let that happen

Daniel Br√ºhl....great in this one as well...

At times like this i praise my German studies :)

thank you!
