There are times when re-viewing a film that seemed powerful at the first viewing can be even better on the second time around. Such is the case for this viewer with US MARSHALS, a film made in 1998 but one that remains one of the finest of the genre of chase thrillers.

The story is well-known to everyone by now: Chief Deputy Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) is accompanying a planeful of criminals to maximum security - among them is Mark J. Sheridan (Wesley Snipes) who is actually the most wanted and dangerous of the crew. The plane crashes and Sheridan escapes, beginning what amounts to one of the most harrowing and dare devilish chases on film. Along the way the US Marshals (including Joe Pantoliano, Daniel Roebuck, Tom Wood, LaTanya Richardson, and Kate Nelligan) with a 'help' from a Special Agent (Robert Downey Jr.) help track Sheridan only to find that Sheridan is himself a special agent etc etc etc. The action scenes are intense an beautifully captured and edited. The ensemble acting is first rate. There is some fine love interest thanks to the presence of the beautiful Irène Jacob and some intrigue involving Michael Paul Chan as a Chinese attaché. The only flaw in the script is that old Hollywood problem of assigning a major star like Robert Downey Jr. to what seems like a minor role, a dead giveaway as to who the real bad guy is going to be.

But in all this film is a tense, well-paced and photographed and scored action flick that wears well with time. Grady Harp
