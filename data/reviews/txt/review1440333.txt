I don't know how anybody can find this movie biased. It's an incredible journey through the facts that the US mainstream media hides, the lies, and the twisted truths they broadcast to affect the American public's opinion. Anybody in his right mind can spot this vast difference when they compare reports from CNN to that of BBC's (on the same story). Everything said in the movie is backed up by solid evidence and proof that won't leave you doubting. What I really liked about Peace, Propaganda, and The Promised Land is that it was Jews (even Rabbis), and Israelis who were 'telling the story', so to speak. In the end, the movie doesn't force anything down your throat, it just shows you what's really keeping the peace process from happening.
