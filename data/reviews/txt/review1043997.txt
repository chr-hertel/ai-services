I like romantic comedies. Roman Holiday is in my top three movies of all time. I love Italy. This movie is putrid. The reason? It is a god awful story, horribly constructed, and utterly unbelievable. In order for any romantic comedy to work, you have to believe why the two characters love each other, you have to believe that they were meant to be together. This generally works best when the love is slowly built up, even if the time period covered is very short (as in one day for Roman Holiday). With this film, we're supposed to believe this woman is in love with a man because of a name? Give me a break! We're supposed to have sympathy for this ditz who's willing to leave her fiancé in the lurch because of a name? We're supposed to believe that Robert Downey, Jr. falls in love with her in 5 minutes, when this woman clearly has psychological problems? This doesn't even get into all the clichés, Tomei's bad acting, etc. Best part of the film is the glimpse or two of Italian scenery. I'm shocked Jewison even agreed to direct this film with such an obviously flawed script. I guess he thought he had "Moonstruck in Italy," and that he could make it work.

Wrong.
