It is such a movie that gets you fell good. Maybe mostly a movie for girls, but yet a great and excellent movie. Ione Skye plays Frankie, who is about to leave in one week for her acting dreams in L.A., who wants to meet the man with blue eyes. And in comes David, new in town and who happens to be employed in the Caf√© Blue Eyes which Frankie's uncle Leo runs. It becomes a crazy week together with Frankie's best friend Allison (Jennifer Aniston), Frankie's gay cousin and uncle Leo. Fixed by the decision to catch David, Frankie does everything for trying to get David to fall in her... but it is really a hard task as he has a girlfriend. A fine story of love, meaningful quotes, insomnia, dreams and true friendship. In addition, this movie also have excellent acting, beautiful ending and as a result, this movie gives hope.
