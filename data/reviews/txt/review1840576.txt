I was expecting a lot from this movie.Wes Craven is a brilliant director.Cillian Murphy is really good in his role,but this is not a quality thriller movie,it has some thrilling moments but this is a very stupid movie with a lot of unlogical holes in the plot.I have to say that i am very disappointed because this movie could be so much better.I really don't understand the bad screenplay.Rachel McAdams is really cute and she is talented actress.This movie is a waste of talent,waste of money and waste of time if you are a demanding viewer.I like quality thriller movies with surprising endings and convincig twists in the plot.But this wasn't a good movie for me,i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone with high IQ.
