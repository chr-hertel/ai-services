I'm obviously in the minority here but I just watched the Director's Cut and hated it. The original movie, while no Oscar contender, was simply a good action flick. The Director's Cut dumbed down the movie by adding a pointless sub-plot that distracted from the main story line. While others say that the added scenes "fleshed out" the characters I totally disagree. If you can read between the lines you can easily figure out those details on your own.

The Director's Cut also added a lot of utterly unnecessary scenes like the part towards the end where the reporter approaches Matt and tells him he is about to reveal the story. What the!?!? Â… the original version handles this issue much better! You just aren't sure right up to the end and then you see the human behind the reporter when he hits the delete key.

While I could care less about the love scene in the original cut, the development of the love interest is much more crucial to the development of the story than others give credit for. If it was not for the love interest then why would Daredevil bother to go after her to protect her? Why would he suffer so much anguish when he thinks she is dead? Why would he have such a smile when he finds the brail charm? Overall, the Director's Cut dragged on in places it should not have, added 24 minutes of nothing to the movie and left out some important details.

Hearing the Director talk about his directors cut made me think of someone who wanted to stuff whatever *he* wanted into the movie without regard for the viewer.

See both versions and decide.
