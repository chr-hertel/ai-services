I didn't actually find the graphics of this film all that impressive at some moments. They used mostly 3D, and it showed, looking strange and too-obvious against the bits of 2D that were actually incorporated.

Plotwise, the film deals with some interesting issues. What is science, and what should it be used for? The plot centers around Rei's grandfather and father fighting over this subject- and inevitably, the revolutionary steam ball- and Rei caught in the middle. It's eye-catching and full of action from the very start despite the weird-looking graphics, and I found myself as curious about what was going on as Rei was.

The film is definitely like no anime I've ever seen. It's set in England, for one, and a lot of animes seek to incorporate some mysticism or "magic" whereas this film simply revolves around a puzzling steam-powered invention. So it's definitely original, but it didn't really "wow" me too much and it's a little difficult to explain why.

One of the few elements in the film that I truly, unabashedly hated was the character Scarlet. She has to be one of the annoying I've ever seen anywhere and though she gets better, as I suspected, she still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

It's not a grand film, but it's definitely not a waste of 2 hours.
