Can't really say I enjoyed Zodiac. 

It started fairly decent then lost momentum half way through. Not especially gory which is a good thing. Not especially exciting either. The story jumps around from the murders to each of the three main characters (the cartoonist, the news reporter, the detective) so it feels it a little disjointed. You never really connect with any of the characters. The movie is not really about the people investigating the Zodiac but the investigation itself. This is when the story really bogs down. Could have cut an hour out of Zodiac as the second half really drags. 

Overall, just a blah kind of movie.
