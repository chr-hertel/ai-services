Ant and Dec are huge in the UK, they really are superb entertainers, but when they are entertaining, they are being themselves, and the audiences loves it. They are the best comedy due to present TV programmes in the past decade. So, they've conquered the TV and music industry (the less said about that the better) and they've decided to move onto the movie world.

They should have stayed where they were. They just can't pull it off as actors. All the way through the film, you are sat thinking "It's Ant and Dec, it's Ant and Dec" not the characters they are meant to be portraying. The acting is just awful, the two of them seem way to pleased with themselves, they seem to be very big headed and too sure of themselves, thinking that they are almost too good for the movie themselves.

The plot of the movie isn't much better, it could have been something really good, perhaps if they cast real actors as the leads. But, still, the plot is boring an uninteresting, filled with weak back-up characters, weak acting, editing and poor direction. I feel as though Ant and Dec only took this opportunity because it was the only movie they were offered.

Sorry Ant and Dec, don't make a movie ever again. I've lost respect for you after this.
