Please before you booo me.. hear me out.

I love Romero films dearly and love the "Dead" (now quadrilogy.) I loved the look and feel of this film. There was an effort made to tie it in with the other films (especially the first) as seen in the opening segments.

The casting was good with semi-name actors, the story was well written, the effects good (not a lot of CGI), the make-up, all this was well above average. A very impressive "BIG" movie.

This is part of what makes it bittersweet for me. The look of big studio behind a Romero Zombie film is to me odd, and a little sad. Part of the charm of this series (Besides the good gore effects in all of them, and stories that are more than they first appear.) was that they were filmed on small budgets. It was the "renegade" aspect of the film-making that gave the first three films part of the "cult" status and why they are beloved and hailed as classics.

The film was too smooth, too polished, too well done for maybe it's own good.

Maybe I just feel it was the end of the independent horror film maker. I know Romero has made other big studio pics (mostly Stephen King Stories) but he always stayed true to this independent roots in his "regular" films. Films like Martin, Code Name Tixie, Jack's Wife, all these had that same quality and "renegade" film making style and "feel" that the "Dead" movies had.

I do agree that it is far superior to the (only in name) remake of Dawn Of The Dead. I did feel entertained when I left the theater, but, entertained in the way you see a good action film once and never again.

But I feel it was just a well made action/horror movie, not a George Romero classic.
