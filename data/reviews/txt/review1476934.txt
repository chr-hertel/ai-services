Investigating a trivial suicide, young detective runs into a worldwide conspiracy... The plot unfolds steadily during the whole movie, and you would never guess who pulls the strings. The cast is top notch. Non an Oscar class, but still a very entertaining and well directed movie. 

I would just like to invite visitors to see pictures from the movie and watch a detailed trailer at RussArt.com.
