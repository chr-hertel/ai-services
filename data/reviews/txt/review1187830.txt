First of all let me start saying that anyone who says "This movie sucks" most likely prefer movies like Armageddon, Catwoman, etc (imo Hollywood crap).

This movie shows how you can still make an exciting good movie using little money. Basically the flick is about "survival of the fittest" withing gangs. It tells the story of several gang-members moving out to another part of the city where sh8t hits the fan. They get in trouble with 4 other gangs.

Fight scenes are really fun.

Just don't expect Hollywood quality regarding special effect (thats the only thing they can do right). The acting talent is also pretty poor.
