A lonely Japanese widower whose son is planning to move out of the house soon expresses his sadness to a friend and fellow film producer, who becomes inspired to hold an audition for a non-existent film so that the widower can select a new potential bride from the resulting audition pool. The widower ultimately becomes enamored with and fascinated by one particular young woman...but first impressions can often be horribly wrong....

I guess I've heard a lot about this film. I thought, if I remember, it was called a classic to some. Sad, I was really looking forward to it. It turned out to be like any other type of revenge-like flick with a confusing narrative. It was a mess! The more I think about it, the more I start to hate it.

It began off well. I could see the potential. Honestly, this is a great, character-driven film but wasn't this sold as a horror film? Wasn't it supposed to be scary? Why didn't anything happen until the last 30 minutes of the film? I think I might be in the minority for not liking this film because I don't know what type of message this movie was suppose to say.

Even if the film didn't have a message (which it obviously did), what was the point making this film? Was it suppose to entertain because I certainly wasn't. I guess it was shocking, funny, and creepy at times, I'll give them credit for that but it was pointless when you look back.

The performances were good but I just don't see the point. Is this trying to be a shocking film? Was the message supposed to be "Looks can be deceiving"?" In the end, this film leads you to more questions than answers, which I'm not saying is a bad thing, but all I think this film tries to do is make you confused, irritated, annoyed, and half-satisfied. No, this is not a film for everyone and it certainly is not for me.
