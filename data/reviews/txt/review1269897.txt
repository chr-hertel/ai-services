Although this one doesn't actually feature the famous diamond, it's still a hoot, just for Insp. Jacques Clouseau's (Peter Sellers) gaffes. This time, former Commissioner Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) escapes from a mental institution - you may recall that he went crazy in the previous installment - and kidnaps a scientist to build a doomsday device. His demand: the world must kill Clouseau or perish.

Of course, this is all an excuse to have Clouseau make a mess everywhere that he goes. Whether it's his apartment, the piano, or anything else, you can always count on this guy to cause a series of mishaps. And of course, there's always Cato (Burt Kwouk) waiting to attack. And that final sequence was great (hint: think of a certain shark-related movie). All in all, a comedy classic. It's a shame to have to learn that Peter Sellers was such a jerk in real life.
