I would have to say this is one of the best zombie films I've ever seen. I would say that it is better than day of the dead but not quite as good as Dawn of the Dead. I enjoyed it a lot. There is a scene where a zombie takes on a shark in a battle. I think he did this for the audience at the time during the 70's were hung up in the Jaws saga and zombie saga. It was a good battle between the two. I was amazed about how good this film really is. I was expecting it to be a decent film that was watchable but it is flat out awesome.

I found it as enjoyable as Dawn of the Dead 1978. I would say that it is a great zombie film worthy of a watch. I am about to watch Zombi 3 but I think it looks like a stinker from what others are saying. So this is definitely worth a rent. Has an awesome twist at the end!
