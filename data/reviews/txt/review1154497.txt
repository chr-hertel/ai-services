I'm giving this movie a 6 out of 10. I like weather but this movie was really unrealistic and stupid. Some parts were okay but i think all of the characters would all be dead by now!! I think its stupid how they play really loud music when they are chasing a tornado. Shouldn't they be paying more attention to the computers and things so they actually concentrate on what they are doing! And of course, there HAD TO BE a stupid "love story" in this. And its so convincing that there are like 5 tornadoes that they actually chase and locate from the one storm cell. The F5 tornado?! i understand trying to get those little sensor ball things in it, but all of a sudden...wait!...it dramatically changes course and it heading right for Jo and William!! (gasp!) they run through barns and they tie themselves up with a piece of LEATHER?! to a pole. If ANYBODY was caught in an F5 tornado they would be dead in a flash. I think that this tornado that is said to be "a mile wide" cannot just dissolve in a few seconds. And is it me, or does the tornado go through the drive in movie place, the aunts place and then by morning......ITS STILL THERE?!!!! a tornado cannot last that long! Stupid movie people know nothing about these sorts of things, i mean i am fascinated by tornadoes but when your making a movie, you have to be realistic so people can ENJOY the movie. And with the sister tornadoes in the water, if they were F3's that "pretty truck" would be off the ground in about 2 seconds!
