How many Casper the Friendly Ghost cartoons are there? One, really, since they all have exactly the same plot: Casper shows up, the adults are terrified, but the children don't know to be frightened. Eventually Casper saves someone's life and the adults decide they like him.

Here it's Indians. There are some lovely cartoon drawings of Noble Savages. But as with just about all the cartoons from Famous Studios -- which is what became of Fleischer after the brothers couldn't deal with each other anymore and Paramount repossessed the studio -- there's very little in the way of writing. These cartoons were made for the kiddies and, except for a sense of nostalgia and some technical artwork issues, have almost no value for adults. Give them all a miss.
