Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead men's Chest was an entertaining film and still the best film I've seen this summer (although that wasn't so hard...).

Another great Pirate Flick with awesome scenery and a FUN story, which was in line with the first one. though there was something wrong and after a few days I know what it was: Davy Jones and his crew are more comically then threatening, somehow I can't find any of them remotely scary (unlike Captain Barbossa and his crew of miscreints). the crew of Davy Jones was overdone and could have been more human... Also the opening scene wasn't as breathtaking as with the first film, it could have been the scene with Captain Jack Sparrow after that. 

Captain Jack Sparrow was awesome yet again and he was great when he visited Disneyland Paris a few weeks ago (I wasn't there though), Jack did a great impression of Johnny Depp!!

Honestly, my expectations of this movie where so high it couldn't possibly live up to it although it came close. Pirates of the Caribbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl is one of my all-time favourite movies ever.
