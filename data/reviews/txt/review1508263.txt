THE CRAZIES plays like a low budget ANDROMEDA STRAIN, but without the competent government response. CRAZIES is replete with official ineptitude and bureaucratic bungling ala today's Dubya administration and FEMA. Common sense takes a back seat to autocratic protocols as townspeople assault soldiers and helicopters get shot at-oh yeah, very Katrina-esquire. This movie also takes a jaundiced eye towards the military. Post-Vietnam sentiments like, "You trust the army?" and "The army ain't nobody's friend" abound throughout the film. Although, where the priest torches himself out of protest like the infamous Buddhist monk is a little heavy-handed. 

70s buffs will also be interested in the song "God Help Us" at the end. It was written by Carol Bayer Sager and Melissa Manchester and sung by someone that sounds very much like Karen Carpenter. I liked the performance of the actor who played the Colonel and thanks to another reviewer, I figured out who the daughter was. She's been in some other 'B' horrorfests as well. I wish I was a screenwriter because with an updated treatment, this script would be gold in today's 9/11 world.
