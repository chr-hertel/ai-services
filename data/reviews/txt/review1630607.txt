Why is it that all stories regarding the South have to have at least one character who is mentally challenged? Oh well, at least Jack Warden was convincing. 

Predictably dreary directing by Martin Ritt (Hud; Hombre).

Brynner was definitely out of place as the lead, but Georgia native Woodward was right on target.

British actress Margaret Leigton was terrific. She's another reminder that even in the 50's, some of Hollywood's best were skinny, chain-smoking women from across the pond. Some things never change, I guess.

The print I saw on INHD was in excellent shape. I wonder why this hasn't been released on DVD.
