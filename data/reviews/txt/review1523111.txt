Red Alert was not just an incredible continuation to a great game but the underlying concept, of the Soviet Union under Stalin fighting against the European Forces was an important revolution in gaming history. The cinematics are of higher resolution and even better than what you saw in the previous game. While several units such as the Mammoth Tank made a reappearance, there are also plenty of new units including full compliments of maritime and air elements. The level design is even better than before. The best part of this game is however, the difficulty. Even under normal difficulty, it is very challenging.
