I just saw the movie last night. I had never heard of Sin City before but caught the movie trailer over Easter weekend and thought it look good.

Wow what a surprise, Micky Rourke was SO GOOD in this movie. It made me remember way I used to like him back in the 80's. What a great performance.

Although some of the volience did make me turn my head a couple of times, I still would highly recommended this movie, if for no other reason then to watch Micky Rourke.

Check out the great way he walks. He's to COOOOOOOOL!

GO SEE THIS MOVIE
