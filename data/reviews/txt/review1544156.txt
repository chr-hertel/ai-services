If you liked the book, don't watch this movie. The Characters are not introduced well. The Urgals are really lame humans... How could they get Malkovic and Irons for such a B-Movie Production. Okay, the CGI quality is good (but not as well animatet as Peter Jackson ones) and there are some really spectacular dragonflightfightscenes with some crazy Camera movement but moves don't make a movie.... I was really disappointed when I was walking out of the premier. P.S.: A little goof for the people who didn't read the book ... first Sapphira ist a "it", then a "she", then a "he" and then a "she" again as she started talking... without any explanation.
