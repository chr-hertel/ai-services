Having heard recommendations from people to see this film I eventually got the chance to last night. Having had high expectations and being a fan of McAdams, I was initially fearing the worst when the film opened and everything seemed quite disjointed. The plot pacing seemed erratic and nursing home set up seemed quite clichéd. It was only after half an hour though that i suddenly was completely sucked in to the film and forgot all about my initial thoughts.

The performances from both leads were so experienced and believable that you can really see them having very bright futures. The plot was quick and involving even if the movie was ridden with clichés. But at the end of the day, it was a story within a story and what is more clichéd than the trials of love.

I found that the flashbacks were more engrossing than the present day scenes but both sets of actors really made this film for me.

Its a film definitely not for cynics but anyone who is a romantic at heart will love this film for what it set out to be.
