This movie is well acted, and Allen has done a good job shifting gears between humor and tragedy. Martin Landau is exceptional as the tormented Opthamologist. Woody Allen is somewhat subdued, and this is far from his best comedic film. I suppose you could say I was disappointed because the comedy is sub-par Allen, and the drama is simply not that engaging. My rating for "Crimes and Misdemeanors" is 5.0. Other Woody Allen films rate far better. "Bananas 8.5, "Everything You Always wanted To Know About Sex" 7.0, 'Love and Death" 8.5, "Take the Money and Run" 8.0, "Play it Again Sam" 8.0, "Sleeper" 7.5, "Annie Hall" 6.5 - MERK
