I absolutely loved this movie. They get the action started straight away. This normally always makes people want to watch the whole thing. The movie was fast passed so parts did not drag on. Chris Evan's acting was brilliant. Defiantly was the right choice for this movie. Kim Basinger also played her part intensely. Her acting was amazing throughout the movie. The movie also had comedy in it. This to me, made it more enjoyable and made me want to watch it right through. Even though this movie was not advertised much in Australia. It is defiantly a must see. It is worth it, you wont be disappointed! This movie will always be on the top of my list.

10/10 all the way!
