In 'Hostel' a group of three friends are touring Europe and are looking for a good time. They get burnt out by the anti-American sentiment in Amsterdam and decide to go to Slovakia; where they are told 'the best woman are". But things are not what they seem.

This movie is a lot like 'Urban Legend' meets 'Hellraiser' with lots of gruesome blood and guts. It is not really that scary and there is not very much that is unique about it. I am a bit surprised that Quentin Tarantino would put his name on this film. There is nothing all that clever about the plot or story.

In its defense, there are a lot intense gruesome scenes; if you like that sort of thing. It is not for everyone. The cinematography was really good and it has a lot of naked girls running around.
