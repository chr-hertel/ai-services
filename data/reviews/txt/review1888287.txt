People will inevitably make comparisons to David Finchers Fight Club but El Maquinista deserves more credit than that.Christian Bales weight loss for the role is well documented but never ceases to amaze.Seeing an actor this committed to his craft draws you in to the film.The film was shot in Spain and has a kind of other worldly but bleak feel to it,a look i know the director was going for.Themes of insomnia are high on the bill and this surreal edge lends beautifully to the films tone.Its also cool to see the great Michael Ironside popping up again and the cast is well rounded off by Jennifer Jason Leigh.I watched the film expecting a great performance from Bale but i got so much more,the film is a clever,brooding little story that builds to a satisfying climax,one you will be mulling over long after the final credits have rolled.
