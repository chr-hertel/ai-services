The Film doesn't start off too well, with a very bad announcer guy for a spoof of ESPN doing the biggest mess ups in sports. But After that, the film picks up with some very good acting for a NICK film. Nathan Kress shines as Roland and Chris Meloni(If i spelt that right) does a good job doing a comedic role.

All i can really say is, once the film ends, you won't be mad you watched it(can't say the same about some nick movies). Its a good film, not amazing, but not awful either, its good.

Nick is starting to pick up well, and Nathan Kress is a rising star that has a great career ahead of him.

9/10
