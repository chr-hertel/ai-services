Effective fantasy where the fearsome visage of the Grim Reaper is transformed into the human form of Prince Sirki, played by a handsome Fredric March in his prime. As Death, March decides to take a three day vacation from his usual duties and mingle among people to try to learn why they fear dying so much, and to ultimately discover the complexities of falling in love.

Nice touches of humor, mixed with the glow of mystery and the unknown. As an added bonus, the movie also has something to say regarding death which may cause you to think differently about that unavoidable day when the Grim Reaper comes knocking on your door. *** out of ****
