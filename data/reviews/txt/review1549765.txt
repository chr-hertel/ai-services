The best thing about "The Insiders" was the opening. The TV theme song was by Genesis, the 1983 song "Just a Job I Do." Even using Phil Collins vocals, "The Insiders" bit "Miami Vice" really, really hard. So at least up to that point, it was "Miami Vice-lite." Was there a cancelled TV show with a jheri-curled dude that wasn't Stoney Jackson? Seriously. While the show wasn't on TV that long it was entertaining in a stupid way. If it had come out today it would probably do OK on TBS or the CW. What the show lacked was a strong fashion sense like Miami Vice. It's like they bit off the most generic parts of Michael Mann's masterpiece - black guy, white guy - the substance, without taking the style. Mistake.
