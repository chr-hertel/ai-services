I have followed her career from the 90's when she made a series of masterpieces with her co-hort Yimou Zhang beginning with Red Sorghum (1987), Ju Dou (1990) & Raise the Red Lantern (1991) up until recently with the great movies 2046 (2004) & Zhou Yu's Train. I am so glad she is finally finding her way into major Western films with last year's Memoirs of a Geisha, this year's Miami Vice & next years Young Hannibal (the latest in the Hannibal Lector franchise). In Miami Vice she is given a major role that she inhabits totally. There has been some criticism of her accent but her English is just fine with me - she also speaks a little Spanish in this flick since her character is half-Cuban. Gong Li has an incredible body - body of work that is & I am so happy her career is finally taking off in the West. Although now in her early 40's you would never know it from this movie where she is totally hot showing much younger actresses how to do it.
