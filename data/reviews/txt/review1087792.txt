It can easily be argued that The Godfather Part 2 is the greatest sequel ever crafted in the history of film, and possibly a better film than its predecessor. It is always a difficult task to better a film in its sequel, doubly so when the original film is a masterpiece of cinematic perfection such as the Godfather was. However, Francis Ford Coppola proved that it is possible to improve on perfection.

The Godfather Part II is brilliant in the counterpoint created between Vito Corleone's rise to power and Michael Corleone's tragic fall from grace. Each character does what they must in order to strengthen the Corleone family. But, Michael's failures are made even more tragic when juxtaposed against Vito's successes. Whereas Vito was able to strengthen his family's bonds, Michael frays them to tragic ends.

Coppola yet again proves his understanding of the relationship between camera and performance. It is not enough to have a lush cinematic experience without engaging performances, and Coppola is able to achieve this masterful balance. The performances by the entire cast are as picture perfect as is possible, and the interaction between even the smallest roles are pristine. Noteworthy is the scene in the Washington Hotel where Kaye (Diane Keaton) opens the eyes of Michael (Al Pacino) to the depths their relationship has achieved. It remains one of the most powerfully performed scenes to ever have been captured on film.

Like it's predecessor, The Godfather Part II is one of those rare moments of cinematic perfection, well deserving of its place of reverence in the history of film.
