Wow. Can I say a greater thing about this movie. Felipe Bustos is an amazing writer. Worther of much acclaim. His work in Feeling Minnesosta is the only piece of work that could out shadow this brilliance. It is not often that a Belgain writer can produce a piece of work that not only has depth but also a lot of originality. I would advise anyone who is on the look out for new and original material in script writing to consider Felipe. He devolops all his characters well and also maintains a good sense of direction with the storyline. I was never bored through the movie. Thank you Felipe. Thank you. And if we ever meet again, I want some money.
