Just when horror movies were becoming predictable, SIGAW and its director Yam Laranas came along to deliver the biggest scare of all.

And it's a scare that's not achieved with special effects and thick makeup and even thicker music -- but by going to the core of what really scares us.

That noise we can't explain. That thing that doesn't look right. That person who is there but should not be there. Something that seems to be following you. 

Sigaw is genuinely, deeply creepy.

I don't know if Hollywood would see they've got a gem of a film here. Sigaw has its peculiar sense of timing. It certainly doesn't conform to a Hollywood formula of one scare per ten minutes. There is a long scene where the director keeps you in a state of simple nervous expectancy. And then are there are non stop scares where you're hardly allowed to breath. But that's exactly why fans of horror will need and want this one. It's a shot in the arm for the genre.
