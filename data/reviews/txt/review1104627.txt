I just watched this movie last night with my girlfriend, hoping to find a quirky and eccentric movie about sexual humor that we both might enjoy. I couldn't have been more wrong.

As soon as the credits began to roll I turned to my girlfriend and said word for word, "This is the WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life." I felt so ashamed of myself because I was the one that picked it out at the video store thinking that it would better than the other choice of Without A Paddle. If I had one chance to use a time machine and back in time to change something, this would be it. I would go back, put A Dirty Shame back on the shelf and grab another movie, ANY movie, but this one.

The plot is absolutely horrendous, the acting is absolutely appalling, and the ending/message of the movie is absolutely ridiculous. I honestly don't see how others can review this movie with 10 stars unless they were severely hit in the head with a bowling ball.

PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOOD COMEDY, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!
