Alright, so the prequels weren't the best thing since the original trilogy, but what could be? I can tell you one thing: out of all of the prequels, Episode III had the best writing, acting, action, and computer animation. Though many fans believe that still isn't saying much (and to an extent I agree), Episode III fulfilled all of my expectations. If it didn't for you, then all you have to do is look at the film from an overall saga point of view and realize that not only does it effectively show Anakin Skywalker's downfall, but it also successfully sets up Episode IV-VI. Anyone who has ever seen an interview with George Lucas knows that the saga is about Anakin and as hard as it was to watch a 9 year old boy whine about being cold in space, Episode III was worth all of it. Lucas gave fans the ultimate film with one of the darkest tragedies in film history (as well as one of the best 20 minute CGI battle sequences ever created). If you were angry because you didn't get to see Darth Vader kill people in his suit....um.....what the hell happened in almost every scene of Episodes IV-VI? Huh? Yeah, how many higher ups strangled to death slowly for our enjoyment? LOTS. Further, Obi-Wan died by getting chopped in half in super slow mo. And who could forget Jek Porkins? Wait...Darth had nothing to do with that one, but it was pretty funny. Anyway, Episode III was an emotional, exhilarating film that not only gave us a visual extravaganza but also an epic story that impacted a generation of moviegoers while forever changing "a galaxy far, far, away...."
