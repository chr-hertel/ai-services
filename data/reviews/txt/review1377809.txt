House's sarcasm and uncaring dogmatism are a relief from the drama of prevalent TV shows today. House's character is on the mean side, uncaring, always truthful, and almost always right. Other characters balance out his character with realism, positivism, and questioning House's decisions. Although show has same basic predictable elements (he's got to solve it in one hour), the path to the solution is unexpected and entertaining.

The characters and the show in general are more believable than normal TV shows, with very few fluffy, useless words/conversations. Most of the show is productive in getting to a solution and gives the watcher the impression that things are always getting done. There is minimal drama between characters as the majority of the show is dedicated to finding out that patient's specific disease, and the character interaction that does occur usually stems from the problem at hand.
