A heartwarmingly funny movie, "The Thing About My Folks" is such a treat! The authenticity of the characters hits home time and again - particularly that of the father and son relationship. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser masterfully draw in the audience with true-to-life dialogue that is both hilarious and heartfelt. Watching this relationship evolve over the course of the movie is such a privilege. "Folks" has given me a deeper appreciation for my "absent" father. Anyone who has a dad will appreciate this film. 

"The Thing About My Folks" certainly deserves the multiple standing ovations it received at the Sarasota Film Festival. Paul Reiser's script is uproariously funny and genuinely moving. The acting is superb, the settings are beautifully shot, and the score is just the right touch. Everyone should have the opportunity to see this movie.
