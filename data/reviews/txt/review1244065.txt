First of all, I'd like to apologize for badmouthing Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings everywhere because of the dwarf tossing and snowboarding elf. I vowed to never watch another P.J. film and was extremely skeptical when I heard he was doing King Kong. I figured we'd end up the same lame humor that doesn't really belong in an epic, and was doubtful as well about the cast. I love Jack and Naomi, but in King Kong? I kneel at the altar of Peter Jackson's vision.

King Kong 2005 left me absolutely speechless. The entire cast comes together to sell the idea of a giant monkey on the loose, and makes you believe in what they are seeing and feeling. Kong is a roller-coaster of emotions from beginning to end. Peter Jackson did a brilliant job of selling the monkey to us as well. The fx are nothing short of incredible. It's so rare to see a film nowadays that can sell that amount of FX in a movie without going overboard *cough* Star Wars 1 - 3.

Without gushing too much, I'd just like to say congratulations to Peter Jackson and the cast on this one, and thanks for bringing my all-time favorite movie monster back to life.
