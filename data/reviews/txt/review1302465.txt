I absolutely adored this movie as well. I was fortunate to see it when it premiered in Chicago at the Siskel Film Centre. I had a chance to see it with subtitles since I am still learning Swedish.

The imagery that this film gives you will leave a lasting impression. It is very graphic but that is the pain, the tears, and anger in the film that gives off the imagery.

The main actors did such a splendid job that I felt that with such a tough storyline that they wouldn't be able to do it but they performed flawlessly. This film is a definitely must see! I managed to get a copy of the DVD but it didn't have English subtitles but actions speak louder than words in this movie. Thus it is a favourite.
