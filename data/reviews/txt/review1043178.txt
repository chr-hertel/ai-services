I'm really starting to come around to remakes... At first I hated this movie, and i hated the Texas Chainsaw Massacre even more. I'm a movie nerd, i downright loved both of the originals. But then something happened... the remakes came to DVD and i enjoyed them 10 times more at home then at the theater... Anyways, this is a very solid movie. Superb acting by everyone, incredible special effects, even better, sound, dynamic picture... I love it. Ving Rhames is the man as always. Sarah Polley, who annoyed me a few times was strong casting, and everyone else was good too. I don't have to go over the plot, anyone who knows anything about movies knows the plot to dawn of the dead. 2 words... zombies. mall. I have to say though, this is not a social commentary, this is a run-of-the-mill horror flick, but its great. Unlike this movie, and TCN, some remakes suck. The Ring, The Grudge... terrible. It was all boo scares (although the grudge had great atmosphere). All in all I'm very satisfyed, and I'm totally looking forward to the evil dead remake, as well as the amityville horror remake (which was a great idea and has a great lead, the classic Ryan Reynolds.. i mean come on Van Wilder becomes a psycho, u cant go wrong... WATCH THIS MOVIE.
