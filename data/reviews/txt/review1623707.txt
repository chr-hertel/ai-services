This is a good movie. It features enjoyable performances, some great performances, and an easy, casual, basic story. It also has the virtue of featuring one of my favorite actors, Samuel Pack Elliott.

The action herein is rousing, but the story is compelling, though perhaps a bit weak in places, however, the performances keep you involved and interested enough to gain some enjoyment from this work, which does have merits of its own.

I found it thoroughly enjoyable, not great or fantastic, but enjoyable.

It rates a 6.7/10 from...
