If you love snobby French cooking, you'll love this.

If you're looking for a fun movie like "The Incredibles", you'll be disappointed.

It's not really a funny movie -- more of an "Eek!" (will the rat be killed?) and "Awww" (isn't that heartwarming?) kind of movie.

The animation is superb -- but the story is weak.

How Remy the Rat controls his human is just dumb. They lost me there. That and when hundreds of rats swarm a house, a kitchen -- I was on the side of the exterminator then.

One rat in a kitchen MIGHT be cute. Hundreds are horrible.

I loved Patton Oswalt as Remy and Peter O'Toole as the mean food critic. But Janeane Garofalo can barely be understood under her fakey French accent. (Which raises a good point: how come some of these French people have French accents -- but some have English or American? Shouldn't they be consistent?) 

They were meticulous in creating a French restaurant kitchen, the scenery of Paris and the animation. I only wish they'd put as much effort into the script.
