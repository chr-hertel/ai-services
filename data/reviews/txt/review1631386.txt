"Made for Each Other" opens with a counterfeit money outfit being busted by Crockett and Tubbs, accompanied by Barrett Strong's "Money (That's What I Want)". It's literally an explosive beginning, with Zito coming out of the scenario in medium rare condition.

When Zito's run of bad luck continues and he finds his home burned to the ground, he moves in with his partner Switek and his girlfriend, Darlene.

The chaos continues when the madcap Neville 'Noogie' Lamont and eccentric Izzy Moreno enter the scene. Noogie's expression as he watches his wife-to-be, Ample Annie, is priceless.

Capably directed by Rob Cohen, this is a great episode. There are many memorable moments, including the most amusing henchmen I've ever seen in a cop drama.

When the show was originally aired, I used to dislike the hard-hitting drama being interrupted by these comic interludes. Time has passed and I now really appreciate the change of pace these episodes introduce.

9 out of 10.
