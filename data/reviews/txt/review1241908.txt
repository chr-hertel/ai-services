If you like panties you will like Agent Aikas escapades.

I was laughing so hard by the end of the first episode because of the relentless panty shots...I loved all of the panty shots...every last one. Even the evil guy who commands the huge aircraft carrier like vessel has his chair sunken in to the deck so that he can look at all of the beautiful pantied bottoms of the hot little sweeties under his command. Oh yeah...the story line is pretty good too, typical secret agent/bad guy/try to rule the world stuff with lots of shooting, explosions and fighting. 

This series is just silly fun, and to make anything else of it is a waste of time. Don't gripe, just watch. At least it's not as bad as The English Patient.
