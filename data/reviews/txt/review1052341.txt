Police Academy starts out with Prankster Carey Mahoney being asked to either go to the police academy or jail, of course he chooses to go to the academy along with many other people such as the rich girl Karen Thompson who likes to dress like a man, Moses Hightower a giant if you ever saw one, momma's boy Leslie Barbara, Girl Lover George Martin, Lifelong Gun Maniac Eugene Tackleberry, Mircophone Mouth Larvell Jones, Very accident prone Douglass Fackler, the two try to be tough Chad Copeland and Kyle Blanks, and mousy voiced Laverne Hooks. They are trained by the very mean and strict Lt Thaddeus Harris (my Favourite character throughout the series) and the tough Sgt Debbie Callahan and every man wants her and There is The very forgetful Commandant Eric Lassard who has the least idea of what to do at the academy. They all go through training and have some very funny moments throughout the film but soon they are called in to save the day from a large bunch of rioters and Hightower ends up saving mahoney's and Harris's life from the leader of one small band of gang members.

a Truly very very very very funny film.
