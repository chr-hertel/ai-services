This movie certain is strange. It is like one of Steve Irwin's usual episodes except a plot is thrown in. Sometimes you don't know whether a scene is real or whether it is fake. The message the movie provides is good though. Its message is that humans interfere with nature by leaving behind rubbish and poaching animals. Irwin has a Keynesian approach to environmentalism. He gets in and really interferes with nature but it's supposedly for the good of the animals themselves. With Irwin dead now it's disappointing for the animals if his efforts were actually beneficial. Irwin's career made him many millions of dollars and instead of doing what other multi-millionaires do like buying a sports car (he drives an old-looking Landcruiser) he put that money into buying land so that developers and poachers can't touch the animals. This practical and pragmatic approach is a fresh change to the usual all-talk-no-action that characterizes most academic environmentalists nowadays. But like I said, with Irwin gone, it's not looking good.
