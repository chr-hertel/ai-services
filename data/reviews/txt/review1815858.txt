This is probably one of the best musical film I have seen next to the Sound of Music. I loved it. I don't care what others think. This movie is definitely up to my satisfaction. It gave a new perspective towards music. The music really out the feelings from inside of. The plot is very simple. It's about a kid trying to find his parents through music.

There are some plot holes, but the music pushed them aside. It was magical, beautiful, powerful and an emotional movie. You could feel the tears in your eyes. Robin Williams was awesome, though others performed well too.

If you like musicals, I definitely recommend this. A movie worth watching. I give this movie a 8.4 out of 10.
