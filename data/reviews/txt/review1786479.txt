This played on Lifetime Television under the title "Going Underground," which intrigued me. There are women who go underground, changing their identities and living anonymous lives to hide themselves and their children from abusive husbands. But this never lived up to it. The heroine didn't "go underground" until the last 15 minutes of the film, and it was shown in quick stills. What did they show, then? A completely ordinary and predictable drama with every Battered Woman chicle in the book. Talk about false advertising! I felt so cheated, I wanted to batter the people who made this, especially the one who chose the title. The story and its ending will surprise only those who have never watched Lifetime Television before.
