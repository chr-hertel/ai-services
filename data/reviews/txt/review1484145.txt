I'm not gonna get into the fine details about the movie, Just let it be said that "HC" is a very well done & tightly plotted psychological morality play. All performances (5 of em') are excellent. And although it's a little bit talky it's still never boring. Glad I bought it. I'm also gonna admit that Ellen Page's face is haunting my mind as of late. She's really great in "X-Men 3" & there's just something about her that's just....well it's just haunting. I'm positive she's older than the character she plays in the movie. She'd make a great ghost in a movie. See the movie....You will leave with some questions about morality & the price of rage. You will surely think about the film for days afterward.
