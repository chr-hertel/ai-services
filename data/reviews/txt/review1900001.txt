Ohnive zeny (literally Fire women) is a trilogy of TV films that consists of "Ohnive zeny" (Fire women), "Ohnive zeny se vraceji" (Fire women return) and finally "Ohnive zeny mezi nami" (Fire women between us). These films have similar beginning, but the rest is different. The plot is simple: two medieval village women Magdalena (Dagmar Veskrnova-Havlova)and Marta (Jana Hlavacova) are burnt at stake for witchcraft, but their lover and friend Janek (Karel Roden) escapes. These two women became ghosts and haunt the place of their death and the dungeon where they were kept before death sentence. For them, it's possible to get a new body once a year, but they succeed only today, in the 1980s. They look like the past owners of the bodies, so the town folks think they're psychiatrist send to town. Magdalena and Marta opens the surgery and heal people with they experience and knowledge of the middle ages - surprisingly, the problems are pretty same nowadays. Then they discover that Janek really survived the trial and the town is filled with his descendants... One of the first films where played Karel Roden.

In part two, ghosts have to find the new bodies - and they get the bodies of antiquities thieves. But Magdalena's new body belongs to a man...

The final part is the worst - television comes to this town to air a local show to celebrate the town founding anniversary and our ghosts takes the bodies of the director and the TV show host...
