1. you like Milla, and think she is hot, then watching her in the movie is a definite plus. She is very hot and very fit. Her dialog is not great, but she didn't write it. Her acting is passable.

2. ... you like playing high graphic games on XBox or PS3, or like watching the trailers for such moves, then this movie will work for you. Lots and lots of CGI throughout and most of it is done pretty well.

3. ... you like bad acting (other then Milla), bad plot lines, horrible script, then this movie is for you. There are so many loose ends and dangling plots that you just can't follow the movie all the way through.

All in all, its a movie to watch if you have nothing better to do on a rainy/wintery day, and can't get out for a couple of hours.
