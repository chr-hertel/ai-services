Certainly not the best work for either Goldie Hawn or Kurt Russell, but the movie delivers some sporadic laughs. The movie asks for a great deal of suspension of disbelief, however. An obnoxious spoiled rich girl (Hawn) contracts and then argues with a self-important carpenter (Russell). Later, she's an amnesiac, who, through a series of contrivances, is tricked into believing she's the wife of the carpenter. Yeah. That's the plot.

Only actors like Hawn and Russell could get away with a premise like this, and they make the most of it. They manage a good deal of screen chemistry, and everyone in the cast works well in spite of their highly unlikely characters. Roddy McDowell obviously had some fun with his role, but he's wasted as a butler with little screen time. The movie tries to be a family comedy, so the four kids playing Russell's bratty sons are the biggest liability of the film. They're just not cute; in fact, they're quite infuriating. Why Hawn or anyone else would bond with these jerks is a mystery, and makes the whole story difficult to swallow.

You'll get a few clich√©s about how poor average Joes with four punk sons are so much happier and nicer than snobby rich folks who own beautiful yachts, but the story has heart nevertheless. With these two stars, it works. Overall, a decent way to spend a rainy afternoon.
