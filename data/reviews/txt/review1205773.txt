This 9 minute featurette, which can be seen as an extra on Disc 4 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2, focusing on the parody of films and Hollywood personalities in the Looney Tunes shorts. It includes interviews with notable people associated with the shorts as well as showing clips from the actual films alongside the cartoon that parodied it. I found it all very interesting, if a bit on the long side. The clips from the shorts are as great as always and there's a pretty good chance that every Looney Tunes fan will enjoy. Overall I didn't find it as great as say "Behind the Tunes - Crash! Bang! Boom!: The Wild Sounds of Treg Brown" though.

My Grade: A-
