There are many interesting ideas in this classic war drama, such as companionship and duty, and they are explored very well, plus the film gives an insight into life in POW camps. It is very well photographed and for the bulk of the duration is quite realistic, however the film's editing fails to provide a continuous flow of action at times. The editing is not really too good, with cuts between changes in action and music that make the editing obvious. There is little else to complain about in the film. Sure, it does not have the same power today as it would have had during the 1930s, and the acting is hardly better than adequate, but it is still very well made. Some plot points are initially ill explained, but by the end everything makes good sense and the film's ending is very effective. It is also interesting how language is used in the film - to show a uniting force that can exist between otherwise opposed people.
