Kasi Lemmons' "Eve's Bayou" is the kind of movie that you'll want to see again because it's a different experience the second time around - the motivation of the characters changes when you know the outcome and can see what's really going on inside their heads. These characters go through extremely painful experiences and thanks to the compelling performances by the amazing cast, they take the audience along with them - so it's not exactly a joyride, but it's a brutally honest one. You feel so tense in this movie, even when you think you know where the story is going.

When a movie delivers some of the finest performances of it's release year, it's hard to single out which is "better", but here are a few things that blew me away:

Aunt Mozelle(Debbi Morgan) telling Eve(Jurnee Smollet) a story , in the mirror, of a tragedy that happened in her past. *BREATHTAKING*

Eve and Cisely in the final sequence of the film. *POWERFUL*

Louis'(Samuel L. Jackson) last scene in the film.
