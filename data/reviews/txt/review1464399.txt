it was a murky day and i sticked the DVD in the player and started to watch the movie and i really expected a great performance from Val kilmer after all the recent stumbling actings and this movie did not really break my preconvinced notions i have been stirring up for Val the mischievous boy of Hollywood movies . In addition to the FAILING screenplay by D.Mamet the director Val's about to glimmer performance just suspended.The clich√© scenario : an abducted politician's daughter and the coercion to plunge her into the adultery business and her complaints of her uncaring father and Val's restless efforts to take her back home in spite of not letting her know how many people have been killed on the track to seize her and take her back to the USA outing her from the clutches of faceless Arabic pimps selling young American girls to rich Arabic people.Besides Val uses the profanity in every single frame and even cursing the kidnapped girl while trying to impede her escape from the container he took . i would only rate this Val's harbinger of his ending movie six out of 10 .
