From the moment that Burt Reynolds drive that Black n Gold Firebird Trans Am out of the back of that trailer -- the world stood still! ! ! ! -- I know that the events of this film are so far fetched that it's ridiculous, but I still yet cannot help but to love this film as one of my all time favorites. I loved the "East Bound & Down"theme song, I love the silly chase scene's, I love the quirky C-B talk, I even love the way actors played these characters( it was almost as if they Burt, Jerry, Sally & Jackie were all born to play these roles- because I cannot imagine anyone else in any of those roles - I hope they never do a remake) --- this is an American classic -- I don't care that the AFI,Movie Critics and the Oscar crowd will never except this as a masterpiece - personally I'd would rather watch Smokey & The Bandit 100 times before I'd watch "American Beauty", or "The English Patient Once" ! ! ! ! --- to hell with the critics! ! ! Smokey and the Bandit is an American classic whether they like it or not ! ! ! A-men! !
