A self-important and curiously cold adaptation of the T.V series that succeeds in promoting big-screen spectacle and a touch of the epic but misses the chance of recreate the warmth between the main cast that made them popular and secured the shows longevity post-cancellation.

The problem with The Motion Picture is that Robert Wise, he who inflicted The Sound of Music and West Side Story on a generation, isn't sure what kind of movie it's supposed to be. It owes its existence to Star Wars but Wise would rather fashion something that looks more like 2001, so its all beauty shots and existential pontification rather than old fashioned intergalactic fun and games. That said, the pluses are the visual effects, which are occasionally tremendous and the score, Jerry Goldsmith at the top of his game - in either respect it can't be faulted but its an unforgivably boring two hours - humourless, slow and characterless so that Shatner, Nimoy and co. look and sound awkward, like a bunch of workers trying to stay civil following a massive argument. The production design makes the new Enterprise look sterile and pallid while the script is too self-consciously straight faced for its own good - these look like the cast we know but they're lifeless shadows of their former selves. It must have been hard for the fans who waited 10 years but Star Trek 1 is a bit of a $40M clunker - money thrown at the screen with scant regard for that all important screenplay. The sequel cost less than half of this but its about 8 times as good, a meaty character driven adventure laced with wit and good humour - The fine wine that follows the overpriced, microscopic main course that didn't taste of anything but had a beautifully dressed side salad.
