After 25 minutes my wife wanted to stop watching this movie. I replied no we have to see how this train wreck unwinds. Eventually, it appeared to be ending several times. But no, it seemed the makers either wanted to prolong the suffering or could not figure out how to end it. Scary? No; Lascivious? No. Thought provoking? In my opinion it is perhaps thought provoking if you are a college sophomore trying desperately to fit in with people who have convinced you that they are sophisticated. Romantic? Perhaps it is romantic if your name is Wayne Gacey or Charles Manson.

I thought the large groups of naked people were posing for the kind of painting you might see on the ceiling of a cathedral. If I'm the only one on earth that feels this way I can certainly live with that. I really liked Secret Window. This movie is 180 degrees from that or any other movie I've ever enjoyed. But I certainly respect the right of others to disagree.
