well if i had to compare both underworld movies side by side i would have to take the first one , not that the second one is bad, in no means, just that it's very hard to follow, there's a lot of pre-story to the first, one, lot's of backstory, now i mean some of it's very interestesting i grant you that, but i don 't think the we needed 600 years worth,, but overall this is a very good action movie, with some neat horror niches, in it,, i liked the opening war scene,, some of the castle scenes were very good to excellent,,, kate beckinsale was as always very hot,, and dam she can also act i found out,, i think michael's characters could have been used better this go around, but otherwise it was a nice performance of th time that he was on screen.
