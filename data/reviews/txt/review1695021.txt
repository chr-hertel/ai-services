much better. I thought the previous Broken Lizard movie, Club Dread, was a decent comedy. It was much funnier than this movie. A movie centering around beer just didn't seem that entertaining to me. It does have some gross out humor that was good. A lot of it concerned the grandma and her handling a sausage or any advice she gave.

MoNique also offers some laughs in this, mainly when she seduces a drunk Barry and he sees her as a very hot chick. The scene with the nerd and frog was just plain gross.

FINAL VERDICT: OK, but not as funny as other films. It is raunchy but nothing like the American pie movies which are much better.
