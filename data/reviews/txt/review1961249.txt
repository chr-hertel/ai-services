It should not be an exaggeration if i say that kate is in her best in this movie not only for her unusual movements but also for her distinguishing hair that changes color with the sequence.I must appreciate Jim carry's role though i am not big fan of him.And above all the story teller must be given a big hand for the twist that tracks down the viewers mind to a deep thinking.Carry's running away with kate through library,kitchen,dining room --all these scenes make a feeling like i am just sitting in Joel's brain watching outside.I just can not stop thinking about this eternal sunshine not only for my favorite actress but also for that good time I have passed with this movie.
