I'm not going to lie. I didn't watch the first season of American Idol, but I have friends who did, and heard all about it. I love Kelly's voice, and Justin's... not to mention Anika Noni Rose, who played Kaya, and was also in Dreamgirls. This was by no means a theatrical feat of any kind. However, I think you know exactly what you're going to get if you watch this movie. I watched it for the music and the light-heartedness, and that's what I got. I was entirely entertained, even though this movie IS 5 years old and Justin Guarini has apparently disappeared. The plot gets a zero; a five year old could almost write the script. But I loved "Anytime", and give Justin's and Kelly's voices a 10 together.
