What a nice and new storyline.It's like Keeping the Faith meets Catch Me if You Can. Like the Documentary it's turned into movie and by mistake turns into comedy.Val Kilmer really played well..outside of his "original" miscasting ways.Downey was pretty good too...nice chemistry with Michelle Monaghan.All in all a good,nice dark comedy with lots of twists and turns...with spectating mode...lifestyle and many more.I hope there is more to come from this..maybe a sequel since this is Hollywood fashion now :).Best part of the movie is that you cannot guess almost nothing from the next scene...and that makes you from edgy to very relaxed ..truly 21'st century dark beautiful comedy!

Enjoy It and Relax !
