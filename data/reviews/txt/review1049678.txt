I took my 8 year old son to see this eagerly awaited British offering. Whilst the animation is sufficient to relay the story being told, i felt it didn't quite hit all the right spots. It contains all the usual characters now expected of animations; unsung hero, villain, comedian etc; but it doesn't quite have the same polish when compared to the more expensive productions of recent. I also felt some of the characters were a parody of a particular class of personnel associated with the British Airforce. My son really enjoyed it and also found it educational, once i had explained that mobile phones and computers weren't available in WWII and that the pigeons were actually used in the war. Go see it for yourself and decide, it's not a waste of money but it's also not Wallace & Gromit.
