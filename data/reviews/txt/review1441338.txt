This has got to be one of THE worst horror films ever made. The story makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The acting borderline's a Showtime porno, and the monster(s) look like Smeagol hooked on household cleaning products. The movie relies on sudden loud noises to actually get any reaction from an audience.

The trailer is actually better than the film! ONE monster would have been enough to take this in the right direction... but NOoOoOo... they had to have a ton of them. It's just your average 'look at boobs covered in blood' horror flick that does little to advance the genre.

Stay away from this movie at all costs please!
