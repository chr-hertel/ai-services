This movie lasted 2 1/2 hours but felt much longer, it would have been a better 90 minute movie. I really liked the first movie, the effects were more in line with the story. The effects were good in this one, but in the first movie they were better thought out and they took my breath away. There were funny bits which made me laugh, but overall it was a boring movie which would be better on DVD so I can take a break. If you liked the first one, you will be disappointed in this, as I was. Why do they keep making making 2hr movies that last nearly 3 hours, this basically shows that no matter how much money you spend on making a movie, you must get the storyline right. The acting was great, I usually like every movie that Jonny Depp is in, but they were having to act very well to improve what was basically a boring screen play. This movie is basically just getting you ready for the next one.
