Very well constructed and shot. Very good locations and action sequences with a great knife fight near the end. It is a good example of how a small independent film company can rise above the stereotypical "British" standard films and that British films don't have to be romantic comedies or gangster films. I was surprised to learn that the studio is new though it already has a professional standard. I look forward to seeing their next projects and i suggest to everyone to keep an eye out for them as they show great promise. Some of the acting of the students leaves a lot to be desire though the soldiers were very good. I suggest it to anyone who enjoys tense thrillers, war films and good combat scenes.
