Be prepared to laugh, and laugh, and laugh etc...............

Every aspect of this movie was funny, from the fake previews to the closing credits it was a comic masterpiece. Not one of the actors was off the mark and every gag was amusing if not belly laugh provoking! Stiller really hit a home run with his script and every aspect of the acting was excellent! I am not a huge fan of Jack Black and up until now have considered him a very one dimensional actor, but in this film he showed a range of comedic ability which impressed the crap out of me.

This is without question the BEST comedy I have seen in a very long time! Way to go guys!
