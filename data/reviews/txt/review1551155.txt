Sylvester Stallone returns in his final go around as Rocky Balboa, this time Rocky is running a none-too shabby restaurant called "Adrian's", is widowed and overall living a lonely life. That is until a computerized fight sequence between Balboa and current champion Mason "The Line" Dixon, ends with Balboa winning, now with nothing to lose, Balboa risks it all to go the distance. I was really looking forward to Rocky Balboa in many ways (After I saw the trailer, at first I was cynical)and this movie delivered everything it promised. There are of course some flaws, such as some of the secondary characters are underwritten (I would've liked to see this go longer, believe it or not) and some of the subplots are either dropped or solved too quickly to truly pay off but once you see Rocky run up the steps and see Rocky make his entrance in the ring, it's nearly impossible not to smile. Another flaw is, I would've liked to see a longer training montage but overall this is a fitting finale and I for one was glad to have seen it. However I still prefer Rocky 1 and 3 over this particular chapter. Still I can't wait for the DVD release.
