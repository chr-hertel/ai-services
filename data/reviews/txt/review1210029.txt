The legendary, sadly deceased Alex De Renzy directed this film that has Jokn Leslie introducing a series of porn vignettes. The first dealing with a totally '80's Lois Ayres all punked out with a superb Mohawk going on (some people not as prone to loving the 1980's as me may think that's a detriment, whereas I dug it). She's topless sunbathing while her family's away. Jamie Gillis and Dan T. Mann are street cop looking for a Perp when they stumble onto Lois, sooner than you can say threesome, they are participating in just that. The scene was very hot. The next scene featuring Gina Carrera and Jacqueline Lorians as roommates who share more then toothbrushes (if you know what I mean), while extremely well filmed, wasn't nearly as good as that first scene. Thankfully the third & fifth scenes MORE than made up for that. Those two (starring Nina Hartley and Ginger Lynn respectively) are both smoking and reason enough for any porn aficionado to give this one a go. Sadly scene 4, being sandwiched in between two amazing scenes comes out lacking. And the last one with a solo Joanna Storm is totally lifeless and stale. All in all I do still recommend the film though.

My Grade: B+
