Indeed it was. Chinatown is about a private detective named Jake Ginnis who investigates a deadly case that involves with murder and water. Chinatown is very mysterious and these are the types of films that will unravel everything your looking for, right at the very last moments of the movie. Jack Nicholson did really well in the film along with Faye Dunaway, but the other supporting characters pretty much had no interest to me and were very forgettable throughout the film. The screenplay by Robert Towne was neatly written out along with the good direction by Roman Polanski, with that saying, in being his last film in America. The film was a little confusing, but maybe I have to see it a second time to know everything. The ending was good and the dialogue had some really good lines such as my line at the top, that has become one of the most famous quotes. Overall, a pretty good mystery that made Jack Nicholson shine. I still don't think it's better than L.A. Confidential, but hey, that's just my opinion. I recommend it in ways.
