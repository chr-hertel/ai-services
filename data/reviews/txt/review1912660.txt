Obviously, "The Fair Haired Hare" is one of the many instances in which Yosemite Sam provokes Bugs Bunny and then Bugs gets revenge (one of the rules about the Bugs Bunny cartoons is that Bugs never provokes the unpleasant situation). But watching the cartoon, I thought that it loosely resembled those B-movies in which animals take revenge on humans. It wouldn't even have to be a case of an atomic test's causing the animal(s) to turn giant, as was the case in "Them!". When you look at how Sam builds his house over Bugs's rabbit hole, it makes sense that Bugs does what he does. Of course, people for centuries have been building their houses on animals' homes; therefore, if all animals could do what Bugs does, then we humans would be in big trouble! Although I have to admit that I would consider it an honor to have Bugs trash my life.

Whatever the case, this is a pretty funny cartoon. Friz Freleng certainly created a formidable opponent for Bugs Bunny in the roughest, toughest, he-man stuffest hombre as ever crossed the Rio Grande (and he ain't no namby-pamby), even if Yosemite Sam was no more competent than Elmer Fudd. Worth seeing.
