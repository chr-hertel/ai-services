I cannot believe a single person found ANY merit in this total waste of time.

Seriously. The writing was unbearably awful - incoherent, muddled and just plain amateur. Really, I don't mean to go over the top here but aren't message boards supposed to be somewhat objective? The acting was no better than a high school performance and the plot line was so all over the place I could barely keep from laughing. "There's a service tunnel from an old funeral parlor to the mental hospital?!!!?" Are you kidding me? This would hilarious/genius if it was MEANT TO BE A JOKE. It only gets worse from there. Seriously. I promise. It wasn't even funny in that great Cabin Fever way. It was just terrible.
