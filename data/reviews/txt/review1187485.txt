Difficult to write anything really....have just watched this film on television but gave up shortly before the end. I'm only writing this because I am so angry that the broadcasters saw fit to show this truly dreadful film. The story was impenetrable and the acting made it worse. I don't think that I've seen a film where the lead actor and actress seem in such different worlds to each other. No chemistry or anything else. Terence Stamp looked bored and the others made zero impact, I'm afraid. Were we supposed to be scared, excited, intrigued or what?? Can't write any more constructive or destructive comments, the film really doesn't deserve it. Deadful waste of time....silliest film ever!
