I found myself engrossed for the whole of the premiere episode, although I had at first been daunted by its 81 minutes.

Although the theme of the repeating day has been done before, I don't agree that this show will become repetitive. I think that there are enough threads to follow to keep it interesting for at least a whole season. The three days in the pilot were all radically different, even though the lead character, Detective Brett Hopper changed only a few decisions in the morning.

I think part of the appeal is the interaction with the audience. Because we kind of know what the story is, we urge Hopper along in the right directions to solve the mystery of his framing. Its like one of those books where you choose your own adventure and there are multiple endings.

There is also an element of the macabre. *How* is it possible that the day repeats itself over and over again? That is a meta-mystery, that lies above the obvious mystery of the murder.

All in all, I think this is an exciting new show, and I cannot wait to see how it plays out.
