This movie really surprised me. After seeing promos for this movie, I really thought it was going to be a disappointment. Oh, I was expected good special effects and maybe some really cleaver twists. But, I also expected the movie to rely heavily on the effects. For some reason, I was quite sure that the story would either prove uninteresting, or (more likely) the writers would be so "clever" that they outsmarted the audience. I was sure it would be so confusing that I would have no idea what the movie's about. I sort of expected only so-so acting, too. Well, I was pleasantly surprised Stardust. This very engaging story held me from beginning to end, and the characters were well thought-out and well-portrayed, with the heroes holding my sympathy and the villains my disdain. As a whole, the movie was well put together, with plenty of action, romance, and humor to go with those excellent effects. I'm sure there are those who won't care for this one, but I think it was pretty good.
