this is a good primer for anyone who is new to the bad movie scene. you can just search each one on the IMDb, or badmovie website or wherever. so, if your like me and sometimes want to look for a "new" movie to laugh at (or with), this will get you on track. as noted already, not too many surprising choices, but i saw a lot of clips from movies whose titles had escaped my memory. plus, it was only $9 at borders, so its cheap for a decent resource item.

again, not a groundbreking item (the usual ed wood disasters, also crawling terror, robot monster), and the narrators voice is kind of annoying, but all in all worth the money and time. plus if you've never seen some of these movies, you can start to greater appreciate the hilarious reviews many of these movies receive. iwas stupified at the clips from the crawling terror.one glaring omission- no beast of yucca flats?
