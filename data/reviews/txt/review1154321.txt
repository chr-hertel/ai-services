Ali (2001) was an overrated film by Michael Mann. Will Smith was not right for the role of Ali, despite what people say. He just didn't have the aura of "The Greatest". I don't think that they should make bio-pics on people who are still alive. You have to cater to certain crowds, try not to offend the living and tip toe around facts and issues. With that said, I felt that the real star of this movie was Jamie Foxx. He should real acting talent in this movie as the infamous Drew "Bundini" Brown. His performance alone is worth a glimpse at this other wise overrated film. I'd recommend THE GREATEST instead of this movie. At least you get to see Muhammed Ali and his real circle of friends act their parts instead of this revisionist tripe.

Mediocre, worth a viewing though. I have one questioned I would like to have answered. What ever happened to Ali's brother. If you watched a lot of his interviews and footage of him in public, his brother is always with him. He's rarely shown in this movie. That's not right. Another flaw that I would like to point out.
