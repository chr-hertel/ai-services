I'd seen numerous previews for this flick in the months leading up to it's release here in the UK, and I thought it looked pretty cool. The typical easy viewing, good for a laugh, evening out with the girlfriend kind of film.

There were a few laugh out loud moments; "This is a 1981 Honda... How Dare You" being one of them, but in general the story, it's humour and the acting performance of Jennifer Simpson in particular were all totally cringe worthy, and I found myself almost embarrassed to be watching.

I felt also that some of the language and references hinted towards a more adult audience, but a lot of the humour was pretty childish. It was an uncomfortable balance.

I've seen better films.
