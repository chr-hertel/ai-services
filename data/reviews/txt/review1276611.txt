I was really disappointed with this film: the score of two is for the occasional 'carrier scenes and the flying sequences.

Richter has written much better screenplays - look up his credits on IMDb - but I'm not sure if he truly should be ashamed of this. Had it been on TV it may have achieved some sort of cult status; it is, however, so COMPLETELY derivative: from Firefox for example; 2001's HAL; Darkstar's (Dark Star?) philosophical AI; sequences from JAG; all of the 'rescuing-a-downed-pilot-from-behind-enemy-lines" sequences and etc and etc. (I'm sure I saw Chuck Norris and Sly Stallone lurking in North Korea!) Director Rob Cohen. Hmmm... Lots of producer credits, including many for TV. Is this his first outing as a director? I must investigate that. I wonder if someone else at the helm might have made a difference? Nah. The whole project seems flawed.

Having said that, it could have been much better. All its antecedents should have made for a better plot line, and they certainly used competent GCI - see some of the POSITIVE comments for this film.

Interesting that the pilots are shown as having the autonomy to morally and ethically consider 'collateral damage' too extreme to actually carry out a mission. Indeed, there's an interesting conflict between the humans and the machine - in this case perhaps between serving military personnel and the 'military machine'.

Still, all-in-all, none of the perceived central themes are developed beyond a two-dimensional aspect. I really would have enjoyed a more cerebral screenplay with meaningful dialogue.

Oh well, it IS an action movie and two stars for the action. Did I forget to mention the actors? Yes I did. Make of that what you will.
