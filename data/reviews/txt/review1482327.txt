This is a good family film, Not Award winning quality, but a good film. Sherean Neville played a good part for a newcomer, but this must have been her only film because I've never seen her in anything else. Too Bad.

The film kept my interest throughout, the story is decent, although somewhat predictable.

I would recommend this for a family night that includes young children. It should teach them something about respecting others.

Like I said, I liked it. There are a whole lot of worse films on the market today. It's good to see a film without killing or sex.
