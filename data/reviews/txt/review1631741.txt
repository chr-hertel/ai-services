Davy Gordon (Jamie Smith) is an over-the-hill boxer, lonely in life and feeling particularly useless to the world. We first find him standing agitatedly in the centre of a train station, puffing away at a cigarette, anticipating somebody's arrival. Via a flashback that spans the entire film (including numerous flashbacks within flashbacks), we explore the events in past days that have led Davy to this moment. Three days earlier, Davy prepares for one of the most important fights of his life, determined to beat the up-and-coming boxer Rodriguez to retain his pride. The woman in the apartment opposite his, Gloria (Irene Kane), fascinates him, and he stares mournfully through her window in an attempt to appease his loneliness. It is his future relationship with Gloria, and her connection to the sleazy bad-guy Vincent Rapallo (Frank Silvera), that precipitates the suspenseful events in the film.

Stanley Kubrick's second feature film (after the impossible-to-find 'Fear and Desire' of two years earlier) is a solid directorial effort, especially considering that Kubrick, just 27 years old at the time, was living on welfare and working on a shoestring budget. Indeed, as the young director was simply unable to afford on-location filming permits, filming of the picture was mostly done discreetly, some shots even recorded secretly from a nearby vehicle. When the sound equipment suffered technical problems, Kubrick fired his sound crew and decided to record the dialogue in post-production. Since Irene Kane was unable to return for the sound dubbing, radio actress Peggy Lobbin filled in.

The first thing you'll notice about 'Killer's Kiss' is that, even so early in his career, Kubrick had an eye for stunning and unique cinematography. The short but brutal boxing match near the beginning of the film is the most gritty I've seen since 'Rocky' or 'Raging Bull,' and Kubrick's camera-work puts the audience amidst the action. The hand-held camera employed during the action-packed scenes hovers just outside the ropes of the boxing ring, as if we are a spectator watching on. Suddenly, without warning, the viewer is tossed into the thick of the violence, and we witness the fight from Davy's point of view, as he cops a nasty blow to the head and plummets to the floor, the counting referee bearing menacingly over him.

At just 67 minutes, 'Killer's Kiss' is substantially shorter than any other Kubrick films that I have seen, but this is probably a good thing Â– I don't think the story and suspense could have held up any longer than it did. The acting in the film is adequate enough (I actually quite enjoyed the performances of Smith and Silvera), though I wasn't too enthusiastic about Irene Kane. To be fair, however, the aforementioned post-production dubbing might have played a part in this.

If this were not a Stanley Kubrick film, I firmly doubt that anybody would even recognise the name of this film (in fact, even now awareness is somewhat limited to Kubrick enthusiasts). However, this doesn't stop 'Killer's Kiss' from being a competent ultra low-budget 1950s film-noir thriller, and it most certainly predicts greater things to come for one of cinematic history's greatest directors.
