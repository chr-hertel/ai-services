Rating: 9/10

When you look back on this film, you can't help remembering these two in Sleepless In Seattle.

Tom Hank's Joe Fox role is completely overshadowed by his Award-Winning performance of Captain Miller in Saving Private Ryan in the same year.

However, lets not overlook his performance here. Tom Hanks is one of those versatile actors, not only can he go from a dramatic role in Saving Private Ryan to a romantic role in You've Got Mail, but he can do comedy too.

Meg Ryan, the Queen of Romance, stars alongside Tom Hanks. The chemistry between the two in the movie, you'll swear they are married in real life.

The writing and directing by Nora Ephron is tremendous once again. Here's a woman who can superbly write men while still knowing how to write the perfect woman.

It's great to see not only a predictable movie like this play out so well, but have also a large supporting cast to boot. Steve Zahn, Greg Kinnear, Jean Stapleton, Parker Posey, and Dave Chappelle provide the comedic relief when Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks are lost in each other's constant back and forth emailing.

When you finally finish the movie, you'll feel warm, and satisfied. As if you just experienced all the love between them with the special someone you have or met.

This is definitely a movie you will not want to pass up. Even guys shouldn't pass up the chance to watch this one.

Watch it and cuddle with your significant other as you do.
