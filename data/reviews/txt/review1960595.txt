This is a little message to pretty much everyone mostly the people who have done this film a disservice by wasting its time insulting it and maybe, just maybe, people who don't have such ridiculous expectations for these types of films. 

Why is this film bad just because it is similar to another film that is good! Grow some balls and accept that not every film is Lord Of The Rings and appreciate entertaining straight to video productions. For what this film is, its good, end of subject. And just because everyone apparently has the same generic opinion on just about everything as everybody else means they are most probably wrong.

thanks
