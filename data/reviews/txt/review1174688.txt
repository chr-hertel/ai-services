This movie about super-sharks on the loose is way too knowing for true enjoyment. The plot has to do with sharks from a government research facility escaping from captivity and going on the rampage. The acting isn't bad for the most part and the script is good. The problem is that the director insists on playing this with a knowing silly attitude, so if the dwarf jokes aren't bad enough you have these really dumb music cues that take the edge off any tension. This would have been so much better had they played it straight.

Given the chance of seeing this via rental or the appearance on cable, I'd wait for cable. My guess is this will show up on the SCIFI channel as one of their Saturday night premieres.
