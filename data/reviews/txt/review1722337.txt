This is so close to the novels that I can hardly believe it. Unfortunately, I read the novels AFTER I saw the movie but I can hardly believe that almost all the text for the movie was in the book. After reading the novels it seems like they didn't even need writers for the movie. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what makes Sin City so good. Why don't other franchises adapted from graphic novels/comic books/video games do the same thing and basically copy the story (i.e. "Doom". That movie was horrifying to watch simply for the fact that they changed the ENTIRE story. Not even a glimmer of the original plot) Any word to directors/producers who are looking to make a movie based on comic books/video games, take a page from Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller and create accurate account of the original story. That is what fans of comic books, like myself, are looking for.
