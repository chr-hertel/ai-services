I have only seen one of Andrew Blake's films and AROUSED is it. I was introduced to his art by chance. I have watched a plethora of pornography and it is all pretty much the same. Either soft core, with the usual women and men having "faux sex." Or the hard core...everyone knows that most hard-core porn is geared towards the male viewers. From the first 30 seconds of AROUSED, I was blown away by the styling, the elegance, the beauty...I was aroused! Beautiful ladies, including the lovely Tera Patrick are in this film. It is difficult to describe how beautiful and erotic and sexy this film is! It is mostly women, all with natural, beautiful bodies and legs that go on for miles! Most of the movie is such a tease. It is like you are waiting for the big moment that viewers of pornography have grown used to seeing- But Blake does not go that route. He makes ART. These women were amazing. The direction was amazing. The costume design, hair and make-up were INCREDIBLE. Not to mention the set design and location. Beautifully shot and very well-lit, going from color to black and white. I think that many men would enjoy AROUSED. But I KNOW that this film will be appreciated most by females. I am proud to own this film and I look forward to adding more of Andrew's films to my collection...Now that I have seen Blake's work, all other adult films are trash in comparison! One final note..this film reminded me of Madonna's "Justify my Love" music video. Very subtle but hot enough that I watched the entire film. I will be watching again very soon. ;)
