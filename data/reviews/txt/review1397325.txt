I have to say that Jack Black is a nut, a hilarious one, but still a nut. His facial expressions are priceless, and when it comes to comedy it can either make or break a scene. I can't however forget to mention how funny his sidekick is. He was undoubtedly a perfect match for Black, almost paying homage to the more present Ren and Stimpy. But not only did Black and his sidekick have chemistry, as awkward as it seemed so did Black and the beautiful new comer Ana de la Reguera. I give her credit on hearing from a recent interview that during the whole film she tried to remain as professional as possible, and I know for a fact that I would of cost the studios a pretty penny from my unstoppable laughter. The point is if you have a sense of humor you'll like Nacho Libre, if not get one!
