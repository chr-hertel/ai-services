Sometimes for fun i imagine how cool it would be if there was a machine that could delete a very specific memory in my brain, that way i could use the machine take all the best movies ever made and just delete the part in my mind that remembers these movies only to watch them all over again and have a real pure experience of what movie magic is all about. In the case of Crystal Skull i would gladly use the machine and write myself a note saying "Danger:Do Not Watch! , Will Kill Beloved Indy Franchise", this pretty much sums up what i feel about Crystal Skull.

I will not go into the specifics of why this movie is so bad because frankly it doesn't work in any level, trust me , ITS BAD!. Where are you Steven Spielberg? this is not a Spielberg film , this movie felt more like someone gave an indie movie director unlimited funds to produce his first ever silver screen action flick. If i could go back in time and talk to Spielberg on the day they decided to make this movie i would have quoted Henry Jones in the end of Grail when Indy was trying to reach the grail and was about to fall into the pit saying "Steven...just let it go" Seth
