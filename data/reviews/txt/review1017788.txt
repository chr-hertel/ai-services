Ian Hendry plays Albert, a cheeky, womanising, door-to door salesman, with a never-take-no-for-an-answer attitude, who lives his life for the moment, and with no thought of his future, or the consequences of his actions on the people he encounters.

Albert's patter, and his way with the ladies, is very reminiscent of Michael Caine's Alfie, made four years after Live Now Pay Later of course, a point not lost on Hendry later on his career, who often joked about life's irony that it was Alfie of course that went on to become a commercial hit, and made Caine an international star, whereas Hendry's film just got lost in B picture heaven! 

Hendry also auditioned, and lost, against Caine for the part of Lt Bromhead in Zulu, but they finally got together on screen in 1971 in Get Carter! 

It's not fair to compare Live Now Pay Later with Alfie, personally I like both films very much, but when you've seen both characters in full swing, you do see Hendry's point:)
