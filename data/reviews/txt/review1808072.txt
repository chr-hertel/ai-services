"UNTRACEABLE" starring Diane Lane --- really good, very much like "SE7EN" - Definitely worth seeing!

I saw it tonight. Thought it was REALLY intense and suspenseful with some really cool set-pieces. Diane Lane is excellent and it has lots of "SE7EN"-esque moments (including LOTS of rain and a grimy look). There is a very palpable sense of foreboding and dread that I haven't really witnessed since Fincher's classic and maybe "Silence of the Lambs".

Anyway, it won't win any Oscars but it is well worth a look IMHO. Very creepy and dark, but entertaining and thought provoking. Diane is excellent in it!

Recommended. Go see it! 9/10
