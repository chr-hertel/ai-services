this show kind of gave me bittersweet memories. i never liked the first 2 seasons how Jesse was so obsessed with Elvis and how the girls where more cute then serious and how at first Jesse was a grouchy girl chaser but then became a responsible nice teddy bear with a few anger problems and Joey's lame "cut it out" jokes and all the crying and hugging and blah blah blah. but i guess society frowns upon that because we all wish life was so simple.

but as the show progressed it became funnier and the problems became more serious. but of course it ended with an i love you and a hug at the end. i became more and more hooked with DJs selfishness and Stefanie's wise cracks and Kimmy gabler and Mechelle and it was all good. full house was a good show if you wanted to watch something happy and that could make you smile.

but again as the show progressed it became a tad boring and predictable and seemed to rely on cute baby's and heart grabbing romance. Danny's Vicky Larson period seemed predictable that it wouldn't last and DJ always had a problem with boys. Stefanie became more serious then funny and the twins and Becky and Jesse made it seem like it was their own show. and Michelle wasn't as adorable and cutesy as she once was.

i really did like the show. it just had it's ups and downs. i watch it time to time on nick@night and it normally makes me smile. the show had the power to make me happy and and entertained and also make me wanna puke. i do recommend watching this show but it can be very bittersweet.

hope you like it
