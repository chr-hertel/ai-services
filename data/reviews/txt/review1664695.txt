I'm forced into commenting on this purely due to the pittyfull marks its been getting (at the time of making this comment its on a user rating of 2.6/10 and is No.98 in the bottom 100).

Basic plot is a group of American journalists, a crocodile expert and a big game hunter travel to Africa to do a feature and hopefully capture a local legendary 6 meter giant man eating crocodile named Gustav. Only they come into as much trouble facing local war criminals, as much as they do when they face the beast itself.

It was never going to be in the running for Oscars or Cannes prizes but come on people take it for what it is, a fun slightly political creature feature about a giant African crocodile.

Personally they could of left the political side of the story out for me same can be said for the recent Korean creature feature The Host also.

But there's enough action set pieces in this to make it worth an hour and half of anybody's time. Nice to see Prison Breaks Dominic 'Linc' Purcell in a feature too.

On a final note the crocodile FX are handled really well considering its mostly cgi. So undeserving of its bottom 100 slot I gave it a better than average 6/10.
