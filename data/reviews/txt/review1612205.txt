Narrated by Sterling Holloway.

This is my personal favorite Disney short. It's a wonderfully animated story about a small white house who was happy, until her residents moved out. The city got bigger, the house got more and more roughed up. It has a surprising amount of character development and sympathy from the audience despite it's short length. The animation is brilliant and colorful. The narration by original voice of Winnie the Pooh, Sterling Holloway was really great. If you are a fan of good Disney produced cartoons, this is my favorite and if not the best, one of the best.

My rating: ****/****. 10 mins.
