In an Oscar-winning role, Charlize Theron plays prostitute-turned-serial-killer Aileen Wuornos. "Monster" shows how, because of how Wuornos was treated her whole life, she was basically incapable of treating anyone nicely. The movie doesn't glorify her by any stretch, but it doesn't demonize her either. It's overall a look at how we are all products of our upbringings. As Wuornos, Theron is almost unrecognizable: she plays a character as unglamorous as can be, with sunburned skin, and girth practically unseen on actresses these days. Christina Ricci is equally good as Wuornos' companion Selby. These two actresses have accomplished what may be the best roles of their careers. It's certainly good that Charlize Theron won the Oscar.
