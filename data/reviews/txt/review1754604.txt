The plot of "Final Exam" is very simple:a bunch of college students start dying at the hands of a psycho killer."Final Exam" is a mildly entertaining slasher flick that is surprisingly dull in spots and goreless.Basically it's all talk during its first 55 minutes of projection time,then the killer starts killing some college kids.The victims are usually stabbed to death with a knife in a non-gory fashion.The film obviously rips-off John Carpenter's "Halloween",but the story is weak as is the acting.The killer's motive is never explained which is quite surprising.We never find out anything about the killer and only two characters even see the other dead bodies anyway.Give it a chance,only if you are a slasher completist.
