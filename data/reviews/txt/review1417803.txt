The viewer has to wait all of two minutes into the opening scene of this dark, satiric and wonderfully delicious film before asking oneself, "Why is Pierce Brosnan doing that?" And from there the viewer is taken on an American-Mexican-European-Asian vacation-like adventure but without the screwy relatives and slapstick humor. Instead one is on an adventure and character study in the life of Julian, the 'facilitator of fatalities.' Finally there is a big commercial project in which Pierce Brosnan can showcase his comedic instinct coupled with his portrayal of an emotionally unavailable and very confused hit-man. The two opposites could not work for anyone else except the former Mr. James Bond who was the epitome of class and savoir faire. And because Brosnan was widely viewed only as 'Mr. Bond', Mr. Brosnan was never seen as a legitimate actor in the fullest sense of the word. His talent and instincts shine as the guilt-ridden, emotionally-overwrought Julian who is as enigmatic as he is transparent. Brosnan's timing and comedic sense present the viewer with a wonderful cinematic gift. Who else could have you routing for a hit-man in the declining years of his 'career?' Of course on the other side of the screen is the vastly underrated Greg Kinnear. His sense of timing and emotional bonding (no, not James Bonding)to Julian allows Kinnear to give us glimpses of a soon-to-be middle-aged man who decides to extend his caring to his new friend Julian. Kinnear's ability to play complex emotions and in the very next instant be the straight man to Brosnan's antics is classic. The chemistry between the two keeps the viewer wanting more. And to this smart director's credit, he leaves it that way. When the final credits roll, you want more of these happy, tortured lives but you can't have it because that is the stuff smart, catchy films are made of.

'The Matador' is a cold, crisp Margarita on hot summer's day that,as you take the last gulp, leaves you asking, "No Mas?"
