I went and wasted $25 (2 tickets, popcorn and a sprite) on what is an absolute piece of crap. all the best scenes were in the previews. there is no real plot and the movie just kinda swirls around like it want to develop a plot, but the director was to dumb to think up one.

what a waste of some really talented actors. i need to go and watch three kings about 7 times in a row to get that desert storm feel from a movie.

if you have a choice between seeing this movie, slashing your wrists or watching your dog take a crap....pick one of the latter two.

i really think that the real guy that wrote the book the movie was based on must really be upset that the movie turned out to be so weak. 

i wonder if i should ask the theater, the director, or the actors themselves for my money back on what was a really awful Friday evening.
