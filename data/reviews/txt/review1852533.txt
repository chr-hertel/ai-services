Leatherheads is a romantic comedy about the start of professional football. I couldn't stop laughing, it was hilarious. The entire theater laughed at all of the right moments in the film. I highly recommend the movie for anyone who wants to see a comedy. George Clooney plays the seasoned quarterback and coach of the football team, John Krasinski is wildly funny as the hot new football player and Renee Zellweger is the witty sportswriter over whom they spar. They were all fantastic in their roles. The movie was a fast paced romantic comedy with something for everyone. It is an excellent follow-up to George Clooney's directorial debut, highlighting his versatility and strong sense of humor. I give the movie ten out of ten stars. It is a great film to take your girlfriend to.
