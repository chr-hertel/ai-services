Yes the fighting scenes are good! But there is more to a movie than watching two people beat the hell out of each other. In fact in an age where fighting and violence has become more stylized thanks mostly to Japanese choreography, the bar has been raised.

Perhaps if I saw Unleased before I saw Kill Bill and before I saw Matrix and all those other movies where the fighting scenes are exceptionally great, then Unleashed would have been a more memorable and enjoyable film.

Another thing which must be made clear is that Unleashed is a story driven DRAMA with martial arts scenes, not the other way around. The cast does a stellar job. Morgan Freeman is classic as always. And Jet Li gave the performance of his career as we are now able to see there is more to his acting ability than beating people up without remorse. 

However the advertising was misleading and that is what ultimately caused me and most of the audience I attended the viewing with to scream out "that's it?".

The previews lead you to believe that you are about to watch an all out martial arts action flick but instead you get 4-5 good action scenes which always seem to come off as anti- climatic and about 40 minutes where the movie just drags on. 

And what the hell was up with Bob Hoskin's character cheating death like 4 times????????? That was just a bit too silly for me.

Skip it and wait for DVD rental.
