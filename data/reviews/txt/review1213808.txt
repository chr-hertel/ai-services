Hello IMDb addicts. This is Brady. And I am an amateur critic. I grade music as well as movies, and I just got back from a movie. It's called "Jarhead", and it stars Jake Gyllenhall, Jamie Foxx, and Peter Sarsgard. And I thought it to be the first cinematic response to the current war. Just maybe not directly. The movie starts as Anthony Swofford (Gyllenhall, hopefully an Oscar nomination for him.) steps off the bus at his first day at boot camp. After getting the hell beat out of him by his drill Sergeant, he decides that the Marine life is not for him. So he tries to get out of it. He then meets his commanding officer Srgt. Siek (Foxx, in yet another Oscar caliber performance). Siek, is a bad ass, pure and simple. Swoford becomes a sniper. And befriends, and brands (watch the movie, it will make sense.) his sighter Troy (Sarsgard, yet another Oscar worthy performance). It follows them in the dessert from the first step off the plane until the end of the First Gulf War. No action, no politics. Swofford even says "I never shot my rifle." in the dessert when they find out the war was over. Simply put: Everyone regardless of your political stripe see "Jarhead". Sincerely, Brady
