This film is Silence of the Lambs meets the Spice Girls wrapped up in a neat little anime package. Loved it. Wished I was an English voice talent in it. The twists and turns in the movies started to make ME think I was losing it. The subtle references to Lambs was great. I hope there is a sequel. This movie is worth buying. Add it to you ANIME collection!!!!!!!!!!! But you MUST rent it. My daughter rented it and she said it was great, that's why I watched. But you must watch it alone otherwise it won't be as scary. The saddest part of the movie was the rape scene. When MIMA goes back to her apartment and she's on her bed crying I couldn't help but cry with her. all in all, a bizarre movie.
