I purchased this film with the notion that it would be your usual 'chick flick slush fest'. I could not have been more wrong.

The film is both moving and uplifting, with some fantastic performances from Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. The supporting cast is equally as good, with the whole ensemble taking you on a journey of true romance.

Be prepared to cry at some genuinely heartbreaking moments and have your breath taken away by some very intense love scenes.

It's hard not to say more without detracting from the film's core storyline, so I will leave it too other viewers to watch the film and surmise their own feelings...
