I really liked this movie. I saw it at the Sedona Film Festival in Arizona. I think it was the best movie there. I felt like the main kid was me. I can't wait for it to come out in theaters so I can go see it again.

Hopefully it'll come out on video. I never went to Juvy but I had a lot of friend who did. I think this movie should be seen by as many people as possible. It is real to life and people need to know about this stuff.

Anyways, I think it's one of the best movies I've seen so far this year. There aren't many good movies out and this one rocks.
