The picture talks on the police agent called Storm(Seagal)whose family is wiped out by a corrupt politician, he is severely wounded and spends several years in coma.He awakes and executes a terrible vendetta, the happenings go out of control ,causing an incredible body-count against numerous evil-doers(William Sadler,Branscombe Richmond).He is only helped by a gorgeous nurse(his wife Kelly Le Brock,now days is divorced)and a good cop(Frederick Coffin). The film is combined of unstopped action,shoot out,violence,fighting, romance between both protagonists and a minimum characterization.Beside abundant fist fights in which body parts are slice off and limbs are slit or blasted apart.Savage and brutal killings make only recommended for those adults no squeamish and with strong stomach enough to take it.The movie gets a certain similarity with Charles Bronson films from ¨Death wish¨series for the matter,the avenger,thus the main personage ,the Vigilante, makes of judge,jury and executioner.It's a run a mill action movie because from the start until the end the action packed is continued ,in fact ,the final confrontation is breathtaking and extremely violent.The film is from Steven Seagal first period when the movies were of middling or high budget(Above the law,Marked for death,Out of justice,On deadly ground,The patriot),nowdays are of bow budget(Out of kill,Submerged,Foreigner,Black Dawn). The picture has an atmospheric synthesizer music fitting to action by David Michael Frank,nicely cinematography by Matthew F. Leonetti and is well realized by Bruce Malmuth.The motion picture provides fast and furious amusing and action nonstop with no sense developed with fast pace and movement.It's a must for the Seagal fans.
