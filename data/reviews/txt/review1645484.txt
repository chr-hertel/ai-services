Lage raho munnabhai.....what to say about this movie.I think this is the most positive & optimistic movie ever made in Indian cinema.Its not a movie showing life of Gandhi and his principles but tells you how these principles can be practically implemented to solve some very common problems like corruption.......using gandhigiri.

This movie is a good blend of comedy,emotions and of course gandhigiri.Everybody has done good acting especially Arshad Warsi.I am sure after watching you will never forget this movie.If faced by situations shown in the movie,in real life, you will always be guided by their solutions as shown.

So do not just watch this movie for entertainment but also try to take the message it gives.............
