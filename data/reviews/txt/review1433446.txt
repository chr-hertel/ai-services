Alex Aja (High Tension) directs a well made horror film with great finesse here...well, the scenes are anything but clean, however. There is TONS of blood in 'The Hills Have Eyes', a disturbing film about a family (Cast members are not important, but movie goers will recognize Aaron Stanford of X-Men: The Last Stand and Emilie de Ravin of Lost), a mom, dad, sisters, one brother, one sister's husband, the young couple's child, and two dogs. This family is on their way out west when the get lost, unaware that their location is also home to enraged and horrifying humans who were mutated from nuclear radiation from atomic bomb testing. And the monsters aren't too happy about having visitors.

'Hills' is full of blood and gore that any horror fan will be a fan of. There is not a ton of mystery, but that is not really a factor. This is a very gruesome picture, as it contains material that no one under 17 should see, including strong and bloody gore, a scene of rape, masses of blood, people burning alive, and explosions. The film does do a great job of keeping the audience attached, which is it's best quality. The action and suspense keeps going throughout the entire film, and doesn't just stick with the normal 'crazies are attacking' plot. It actually grows into more, like a good movie should. I must add that Emilie de Ravin is a ton of fun to look at, so that was probably one thing that helped me enjoy more. The ending does leave it open for a sequel, which is great, because I can't wait to see more films like this. This film is not as scary as High Tension, but it IS better. Any horror fan will love this film, and any movie fan who can stand for the gore and blood will enjoy too. Alex Aja has done well on this one, and I look forward to watching more films of his.
