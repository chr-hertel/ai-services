Let's get this on the table from the beginning: I like Woody Allen. There's something pathetically real about the guy and the characters he creates and portrays in his movies. But what about the movies themselves? Hannah and Her Sisters is his best film, IMO, and is an intricate, entertaining movie that doesn't try to be "all that NYC chic", like Annie Hall, for instance.

Conversely, Sleeper is everything that HaHS is not and nothing that it is. Imagine a movie version of James Halperin's The First Immortal directed by and starring Charlie Chaplin, throw in a dash of know-it-all New York cynicism and you've just about got it.

There are words that describe how terrifically bad this movie is, but it depresses me to waste time writing them. Suffice it to say that if not for the existence of the muppety The Dark Crystal, Sleeper would be the worst movie I've ever seen on purpose. And yes, this analysis does include the late-night Cinemax flicks starring Tawny Kitaen that I used to stay up all night to watch, hoping for a glimpse of tawny thigh...

All I could do was wish for it to be over, but even at 89 minutes it was interminable. Thankfully I fell asleep twice, but never for long. My wife dislikes Woody intently - if this had been the first Woody movie I saw, she would be a happier woman, because I never would have brought home another.
