This episode from 2006 was released on DVD in the US as Season 13! I was very happy to see IMDb reporting a "season 13". 

IMDb says their Season 13 episodes were shown on air in October, 2008. Looking forward to more Frost!. 

This series is one of the best of the British detective series in my humble opinion. Check it out if you like cantankerous old detectives with hearts of gold. I hope it goes on and on.

My other favorites are Wire in the Blood, Prime Suspect, Hamish MacBeth, The Last Detective, Touching Evil and Da Vinci's Inquest. That last is technically Canadian but I don't hold that against it - lol.

Sorry I'm not really reviewing this episode, I just wanted to point out the confusing season naming on the US DVD's.
