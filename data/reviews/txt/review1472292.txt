"The Seventh Seal" would strike me as a better film today had Ingmar Bergman not gone on to remake virtually the same film countless times over the rest of his career.

In "Seal," Max von Sydow sits down to a game of chess with the Grim Reaper and seeks answers to the meaning of life, existence of God, and so on and so forth. If you've seen one Bergman film, you've seen them all. The poor man put a lot of effort into exploring life's BIG issues but never seemed to get any closer to an answer about any of them. As I've become a more sophisticated movie watcher, I find Bergman's style nearly intolerable. His films are airless and stifling, and hopelessly pretentious. It's been a long time since I've seen "The Seventh Seal," and maybe I would have a better opinion of it on a second viewing, but frankly, I would rather watch "Snakes on a Plane" than watch this film again.

One of the famous images in this film is the shot of the Reaper leading a dance of death across a stark hillside. Woody Allen aped it in his 1975 film "Love and Death."
