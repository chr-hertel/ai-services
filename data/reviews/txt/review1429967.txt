If you know anything about the Wayans Family (headed by brother Keenan) you know that they have a way of spoofing that is at once offensive and hilarious at the same time. I missed this little feature but caught it on cable recently. The subject matter is totally off the wall but the actors really make it work. Lisa Kudrow is very good and shows her Friends "Phoebe" character to a tee. Christine Baranski is also a hoot as are Kudrow's princess friends. The fashions are hilarious as well. Damon Wayans does some characters that I don't particularly care for -- the disabled super hero is one -- and his younger brothers also are not my favorites. Remember, they also do the Scary Movie parodies. This one, however, is reminiscent of Bamboozled but better since Spike Lee has a tendency to lose his vision in the final third of a movie. This little film should be taken just for what it is - a broad parody with some genuine laughs. Dick Benjamin is also excellent in a dead pan role as Kudrow's father. I wouldn't buy this one but would definitely watch it again. If you liked BAPS (which I didn't particularly) then this one will work. Also in the same silly vein as the one about the white dude from Malibu who thought he was so down. I could also recommend a movie called Jackie Washington, another parody that is pretty funny.
