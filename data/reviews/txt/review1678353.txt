I think some things are so special, that you are literally left speechless. You don't want to spoil it by saying anything, but just think about it for a while. This is exactly how I felt after having watched this film.

I didn't sit down expecting a lecture on how to save the environment, or how we could all be doing so much more, and that is not what this programme was about. I think a lot of people were upset about the moral message being overshadowed by the impressive visuals and lighthearted voice-over, however I stand by that people do what they can, and if they're too lazy to change, then no matter what amount of lecturing and shock tactics will really make them any better.

The show basically just rolls out a bunch of digits- averages of things that will occur in a person's lifetime, like the people they will meet, the tears they will cry and so on. While watching it however, and perhaps I should be ashamed of this(?), I was not thinking about what a ghastly person I am making such a dent in the world, I was just intrigued.

This was an absolutely beautiful piece of work, and was both interesting and quirky. No one could have been better suited to narrate it that David Tennant, who makes it all a little less heavy, and it was entertaining to watch.

I personally would love to see this again, and would certainly buy it if it comes out on DVD. If it is repeated then it is definitely worth a try at least, even if you don't feel you can sit through all of it. I think it is more a piece of art than anything, and should be appreciated as that.
