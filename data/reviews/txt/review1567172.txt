well... the movie was intended to be a fun movie for mass.. and how it disappoints. Right from the start, the comedy is pathetic...

The movie has some illogical steps like a school dropout is made to be a student to pass out 10th..with the assumption that anybody who passes 10th can be traffic constable. ileana after her great role in pokiri (and great looks), looks like a dirty damsel in this. She acts as a teacher and the way she dances (in heroes dreams) but still not expected from an actress who wants to make a name for herself.

Raviteja was doing some good movies, but if he continues doing movies like this, he might have to return to being a side actor.

Totally waste movie.
