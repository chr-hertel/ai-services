This movie is fairly mediocre, and I'm a little perplexed by the high ratings it has received. It was okay, but I think the 1951 version far surpasses it. Unfortunately for Reginald Owen, who turns in a decent performance, Alastair Sim came along and pretty much defined the role. 

It's been a long time since I've read the book, but it seems like the 1938 screenwriters took several liberties with the text (e.g., Scrooge fires Cratchit on Christmas Eve, the whole sliding on ice thing, and most noticeably, the omission of when the Ghost of Christmas Present reveals the twins of Want and Ignorance).

I just finished watching the 1938 version with my parents, and we were laughing in some parts, in particular in the scenes where the Christmas spirit seems to manifest itself in the Cratchit family as a form of extreme mania.

The movie is nonetheless watchable, particularly if you're in the holiday spirit.
