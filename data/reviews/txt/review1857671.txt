My husband used to work with Wade. He knew or still knows some of the individuals that are in this movie as they are in real life. It's a mostly true portrayal of actual events. They did actually go to the concert that was portrayed in the movie and many others in the long run. If some think that it's a bad remake of "One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, I wish just for one day they could live Mike's life. You'd no longer criticize this movie. For those of you that can't forget the movie, I'm glad that it's made that type of an impact and I hope when you see someone like Mike you offer assistance. 

I also encourage people to get involved as there are still people living like Mike was. Our government has laws in place that keep people trapped in nursing homes instead of being able to be productive members of society. Just because a person's body doesn't work like most doesn't mean they don't have a mind. Check out www . adapt . com for more information on the true lives of these individuals.
