"Of Mice and Men" is a good novel for readers of all ages and a particularly excellent film, i.e. the version with Gary Sinese and John Malkovich. However, my problem is.... where can I get this DVD? I am resident in China and a year or two ago I was able to find it. Now it is the most elusive DVD to locate. This movie is a classic and the book is just the right length to be perfect for English Literature classes for students of good and not so good ability. Why should it be hidden away? At present no one is able to view it. The promoters of this DVD should be doing their jobs and creating access to it. Who is getting any benefit if is hidden in a secret location? I have shown this movie before and everyone loves it. Please help me find this movie because it is good in its own right and a perfect adaptation of the book. Literature and language students are the poorer for the lack of promotion.
