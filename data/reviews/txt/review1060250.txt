If not the finest film ever made -- and that is arguable -- MADE is my favorite picture ever. Why?

1. The finest performance by a child actor since "The Piano" 2. Retains the good vibe of Swingers without being anything close to a sequel 3. Peter Falk 4. Comparable to but utterly different from Christopher Guest's amazing oeuvre, Made has the funniest improvisational quality on film since Cassavete's "Husbands" 5. The lovable Faizon Love as the hapless henchman of Sean Combs 6. "There's a lot going on ... but then, there always is. A lot going on." 7. Shot in the USA 8. The opening boxing scene -- Favreau and Vaughn beating the crap out of each other -- is followed by them driving through the Hills, sharing a ride home (and Vaughn unwittingly setting fire to Hollywood by throwing a lighted match out the window.) 9. Tom Morello of Rage Against The Machine makes a cameo. 10. Dean Martin made the soundtrack, again.
