While the Kilmer and Clooney movies left Batfans moping, the recent video games have been even worse. But, much like the film version, Batman Begins is a glorious rebirth for the tragic crimebuster.

Playing like a pacier version of Splinter Cell  with dramatic, movie-style presentation that puts Metal Gear Solid to shame  it's a stealthy action-adventure where players creep around the shadowy streets of Gotham City, solving crimes and ambushing mobsters.

Uniquely, Batman Begins allows players to scare their rivals witless; when you spot a crook a special meter indicates their heartbeat, and you can then hide in the shadows and kick over objects to make your opponent jittery and nervous, only making your grand entrance when they're quivering like a jellyfish.

The game also allows players to jump behind the wheel of the new tank-like Batmobile for hair-raising dashes across Gotham, sequences that are as shallow as Adam West's Batman TV series but just as much fun
