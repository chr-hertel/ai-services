I bought this movie as a joke gift for my wife's 30th birthday. We sat down to watch it expecting to get bored and eventually turn it off. The acting was poor and the special effects were primitive, but the story line held our attention. This movie was actually ahead of its time in so many ways. I recommend watching it, but remember that it came out before many of the innovations in movie making we expect today. The movie is actually not bad if you can get past some of the lame fight scenes.

"Happy 30th Birthday Logan's Run! I'm looking forward to your 'renewal' in 2007."
