Syriana is both ambitious and demanding; plot is gripping and divided into subplots perfectly combined, screenplay, along with the Middle East setting, is impeccable. Very different than other espionage thrillers, not only because it contains deep reflections on our reality but also for being accompanied by reflections and mind stimulations. Acting's convincing, clarity in telling facts is total and plus it's more detailed than any other geopolitical flick I've ever seen. It aims at showing the marriage of global business and politics, together with US interference in every dirty affair. From top to bottom a must-see movie..
