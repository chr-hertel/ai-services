What a horrible movie. I don't care that Mike Myers wasn't in it because, to be honest, I'm not a big fan of the Halloween series. The movie was just horrible. Sure, some director tries to do something differet. Does that make it a good movie? Far from it! The plot was just awful, the acting was awful, the ending was awful. "Season of the Witch" is a generic Halloween seasoned title even if there was no witch in the movie. There was no character development, the main guy we can only assume is a creep for cheating on his wife. Unfortunately, my friend had to buy this movie to complete the Halloween series. What a horrible mistake. He will never again look at that DVD again.
