This documentary presents itself and it's subject matter so seriously and so earnestly as to teeter on the edge of becoming self parody.The film is given an arty treatment with very stunning cinematography and subdued narration.The narration is rather oblique and clouds the theme, most likely in an attempt to keep you watching and asking yourself what the hell is this.The filmmakers sincerity at attempting to present these people in a sympathetic light doesn't really work it actually comes across like surreal dark humor.I think It's probably because bestiality is so far from the average persons experience.If you look at other touchy subjects like pedophilia as aberrant as it is the average person knows it exist.We've all heard about the Mexican girl and the donkey but know one really thinks that it happens, I don't think the the public is willing to accept people who have sex with animals and this film gives know real reason why anyone should.I give the filmmakers kudos for attempting this,even though the end result is jaw droopingly weird.I give the film a 7 because it gives Eraserhead and Visitor Q a run for there money.
