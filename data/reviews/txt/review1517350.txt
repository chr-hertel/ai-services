this film was a classic hippie film ..........i saw it in Florida at the midnight surf movie theaters. totally unique---- and i have been wondering about it for more than thirty years.

hard to believe this director went on the the chainsaw thing............almost impossible to imagine since the love message of the late 60's was so central to eggshells.

hopefully someone will know how to get a copy.

it's is very satisfying to know that someone else out there remembers this great piece of film and that i just didn't imagine the whole thing.
