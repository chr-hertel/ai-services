So I don't really believe much people outside Serbia will see this...Even better, because this movie gives wrong and unrealistic picture of Serbia. In fact, it gives pretty good picture of rich and wealthy inhabitants of Belgrade. Here we have shallow love story about dentist falling in love with his patient. Naive, shallow story, OK then, there is hundreds of movies like that. I gave 2/10 just because this is technically, very well done, you will see couple of nice panorama views of Belgrade. Otherwise, this is dedicated to the life of rich and upper class people in Belgrade, nice, luxury apartments, flats, nice pricey cars, nice garments, etc. Everything is so nice (well, in fact, there is one scene with poor man searching thru garbage, but you'll soon forget it,since it last couple of seconds only) but the story is poor and predictable. Acting is also poor and with lots of miscast. Sorry, I gave 2/10, I like Serbian movies, but this one is poor and under-average.
