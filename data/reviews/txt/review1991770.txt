Thoroughly enjoyed this one. The basic premise offers one explanation for the title, but a closer look at the characters offers yet another, deeper meaning. This one is best watched with an eye to the things we often do not see, the people we overlook, and the blessings we don't recognize. Fantastic work in every respect.

Justin Chatwin and Margarita Levieva are fantastic in their roles, and director David S. Goyer used their talents well to bring out the characters. The writing is superb, and the settings are the perfect backdrop for this moving and mysterious drama. This is one of the better films I have seen in recent years, and should not be under-appreciated.
