Before I say anything, let me be clear that this is NOT a horror movie. Please! I think the appropriate genre would be a D grade Gory murderous movie. ******* I don't even know where to begin. I read some reviews on IMDb and finally decided to rent it. Now I hope I'd rented "The Ring" instead. This is a bloody, vulgar presentation of something that the director wants to call a story. I don't care if it's based on true events. I switched it off when there were about 45 minutes left. As the guy with the knife started to chop off fingers, I thought I'd seen enough of this stupidity.

It slightly reminded me of "Wrong Turn", which on the other hand had some really good actors and fast paced story. This one is a D grade movie with nothing to scare you. It will only make you sick. Jus avoid at all costs and find something better to do. Too bad I won't get back the hour I wasted on this crap.
