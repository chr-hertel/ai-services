All the actors put in fine displays. Yet I thought the script was a bit cheesy, even for this film, and some of the sequences were far too over the top. And Orlando Bloom put in another wooden performance, though I believe his acting was better than other times I have seen him on the big screen.

Jon Depp was great as usual as was Keira Knightly who just gets better and better. The confusing thing for me is who does Elizabeth Swann like? Jack or Will? Because all through the film I couldn't decide.

The action sequences were on the whole very well done, and the humour all the way through the film made it easily watchable.

As pace and action go the film was well directed and when it finishes you'll already be counting down the clock for the third film! And if you wait long enough... right through the closing credits, there's a very short scene at the end just like there was in the first film.

Well done Mr Verbinski because after I had seen 'The Weather Man' I was slightly worried. But you don't need to be. Fans will love it. Just don't go into the film expecting realism. It is fun fantasy adventure! Enjoy!
