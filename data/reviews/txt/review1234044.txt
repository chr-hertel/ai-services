This year has pretty much been bad movie after bad movie with few exceptions including Sin City, but going into the theater to not just pay witness to best movie this year but the best Peter Jackson movie ever. The effects were just so amazing that you simply forget the word special effects.

Like every masterpiece you feel its too short even though it may even be three hours long. Don't wait for this to come out on video because this is a film designed for the theater.

Simply amazing, A must see.
