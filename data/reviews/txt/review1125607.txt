My Own Private Idaho is flimsy, unconvincing and wildly overrated. Although it is a film worth watching, for River's performance if nothing else, its accredited greatness is no more than a wishfully constructed social myth.

I wish I could say how truly remarkable the film is, but to be honest it lacks substance, it leaves you yearning for something moreÂ…I think much of the talent in the film is unexploited to its best potential and the dialogue, in its second half, written in a kind of impromptu, mock Shakespeare, is devoid of any magic.

Overall the film is watch-able and has some great shots, like that at the beginning where the viewer joins Mike (River Phoenix) toward the end of a blow-job he's receiving from a john; when he comes the image of an entire house being dropped onto a desolate highway charges the screen.It's sad and beautiful, and, is a perfect statement on Mike's yearning for a home he never had.
