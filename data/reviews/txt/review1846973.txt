I've been wanting to see that movie forever. Well, since it was out in the cinemas, at least. Always spotted another movie and went to see that one instead. So I just FINALLY rented it today. And I must say something, I am disappointed I didn't see it on big screen. It was amazing. A real 'chef d'oeuvre'. It was extremely touching, the characters are well played. I never thought I'd be that emotive over that movie. I have now the urge of going to buy it as soon as possible so I can watch it over and over again. It makes my inner kid dream, makes my heart swell with hope and happiness. I definitely would recommend it to anyone who'd ask me if it is good or not.
