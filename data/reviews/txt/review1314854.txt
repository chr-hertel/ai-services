I lately have just been going through my university library, looking through the A section of the movies, and decided to pick this here film up one day. Not thinking much of it and not seeing s Werner Herzog film before I didn't really have any grand expectations. As I watched this film however, I became more and more enthralled. This was quite entertaining even though the acting may be mediocre and the sounds may also have been sub-par. The work by the cinematographer and just the way the entire film was put together, especially the introductory scenes and the end scenes was just plain magnificent. Granted, I did watch the film in German with the subtitles so I don't know about any poor dubbing or anything, I would have to say that this is one mighty-fine film.
