It is not that is a bad film, it is just that the whole story is hollow. You've seen it before: strong women, usually belonging yo the same family, having weird yet mostly amusing quirks, entertain the audience with their sparkly and refreshing relationship. Male characters are just for decoration, cardboard clich√©s with nothing better to do than either fall in love with the complicated women, either being total jerks.

Women might enjoy this movie more than I did, but it is hardly average. There are some good jokes and there is decent acting in it. The script wanted to be something like an onion being peeled away, showing layer upon layer of familial complexity, but they either run out of imagination or out of money by the end of the first half.
