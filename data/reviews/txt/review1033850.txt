A day in the life of nobodies. Sound like a good movie? It probably sounded like a good experiment to Richard Linklater who made this for about $20,000. It's a nice film to start out with but it's really of no use or interest outside of college film students.

There's not much to Slacker other than a bunch of meandering dialogue scenes and long steadicam shots (in a 100 minute movie there are only 163 cuts). We follow one character who talks nonsense onto another character who talks nonsense onto another character yadda yadda yadda. Each scene is shot the same way and had little to make it stand out. None of the characters last more than 5 minutes and their stories just seem like an outlet for Linklater to vent some of his cynicism or frustration with society.

Much like the characters it superficially studies, Slacker wanders nowhere, achieves nothing and wastes time. It's NOT a good way to spend a Saturday night.

The DVD is in 1.33:1 as originally shot with Dolby 2.0 surround. It contains a zillion extras over 2 discs that I plain and simple will NEVER watch because the film bored me to death. I give it a 3/5 purely because it's different from the usual mass-produced crap we get from the big studios.
