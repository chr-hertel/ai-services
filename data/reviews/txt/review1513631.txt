Why do we love? That's the question I asked myself when "Splendor in the Grass" finished.

The story is just beautiful. A girl falls in love with a boy. They start dating together, but the most obvious and sexist thing appears: the sex. He wants sex, she wants not. So What Does He Do? He searchs for another girl. Then, she goes mad.

To keep our virginity was an important thing in the past, but no nowadays. No one's considerated good people if he's virgin or if he's not. Just if you're happy... That's why the end shocked me so much.

At the end, everybody has a secret (and eternal) love... who stay with us until our death...
