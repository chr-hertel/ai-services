The opening title shots of Peter Fonda riding along the California coast to the sound of some very cool music gives the false hope that this is a classic film. If you could stick Dennis Hopper along side it could almost be the opening to Easy Rider. However it quickly goes down hill.

By the closing shots in the graveyard the only thing keeping me going was the hope that the locals would beat the crap out of Peter Fonda and his hideous friends. They had just attended the funeral of one of their friends at which they smashed up the church, raped his girlfriend, pulled the dead guy out his coffin, stuck a cigarette in his mouth and pushed the preacher into the coffin instead.

I've rarely seen a film that made me feel such contempt for the main protagonists. I think the closing shot of Fonda standing alone in the graveyard was meant to be deep and meaningful. It wasn't.

The only reason I would recommend this film is for the same reason I watched it. To see the film that Primal Scream sampled for their classic hit Loaded. Having seen it I can't for the life of me imagine why they did.
