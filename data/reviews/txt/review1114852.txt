This is one of the best movies I have seen this year. The direction was outstanding (Duh! It's Spielberg) and the acting was fantastic. The storyline was terrific, but I think the ending could have been written a bit better. My favorite part had to be the special effects. I have not seen a movie in years that had special effects that looked realistic. The effects in this movie superbly depict what it would be like if this scenario actually happened. You actually feel like your involved in the movie, as if it was really happening to you. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and jumped off it when the time came. It was intense. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone, except children. It scared the crap out of me and I'm not one to scare easily. I also suggest going to the restroom before the movie begins because you may not want to leave once the movie starts. The movie sucks you in and keeps you thinking.
