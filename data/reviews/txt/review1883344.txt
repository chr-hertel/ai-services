Why did they make this movie in English ? They screwed it up. Besides they made it quite long and boring. What is saved is the story and that it is based on a book from Gabriel Garcia Marquez. The acting is not bad but could be improved. Also, why did they hire actors with different accents, it makes a bad movie worst. The scenery is what also saves part of the movie. What I do not understand is how can anyone believe that the same actress can portray a teenager and a 72 year old woman. Next time they make a movie from a hispanic literature book, please make in Spanish. They loose a lot of what the book tries to communicate by translating it to English.
