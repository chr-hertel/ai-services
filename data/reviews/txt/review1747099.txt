Ah.. great movie. Completely entertaining and is just what you should watch every Halloween night!! First off, the plot. Great concept, and put into action in a fantastic way.

The voices fit the characters perfectly. Couldn't have been better. 

The whole thing is candy for your eyes.

And of course, the ending. The ending is everything in a movie. And it wrapped this wonderful little movie up perfectly.

Tim Burton has certainly done it again! I can't wait for more movies from him.

9/10 Wonderful job.
