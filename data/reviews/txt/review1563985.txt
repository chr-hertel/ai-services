I am not often motivated to submit my opinion of a movie whether or not it is a great blockbuster or should be at the lowest rung of the opinion ladder. I have always admired Freddy Rodriguez after first seeing him on the super TV series "Six Feet Under" and wanted to see how his career in movies and TV started. What a disappointment to say the very least with such TRIPE and senseless nonsense as this DVD movie "Shock TV"!! What a waste of time, effort, actor's skills and plot content as this movie actually is, besides a total waste of petrochemical resources to reproduce such trash on the DVD media used to vend this product!!! Therefore I gave this movie the bottom-most vote and would have chosen a ZERO if that option had been offered, and without my being cast into the 'spoilers' classification!
