The opening scenes are poorly acted out and the suspense level is not even noticeable. If I were a pilot that had just gotten shot down, I would be a WEEE bit more hysterical. No name actors and a no name producer with a no name production company = a no name film that has no value. I would give it a great big "0" if I could, even negative numbers are too high! I tried to watch this film with all of my imagination, but it was really hard. I just couldn't get my mind around it. I have been in the military and I know that people just don't act like that when under pressure. The human element just isn't there. The female pilot is too robotic in her verbal responses and I just thought it was quite boring. I was truly underwhelmed. Save your money and get the Bourne series, a much better series of films and a recognizable acting team. BTW, what was the budget for this loser film anyway?? Probably a six pack of beer and a bag of chips.
