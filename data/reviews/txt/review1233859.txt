The movie "Slutty Summer" is referred by critics as a gay version of "Sex and the City". This is only half-true because although it has similarities in content and structure the movie is so much more than that. First, there is the well crafted script. The basic elements of great comedic story-telling are well placed, the characters are (although for the sake of comedy exaggerated) believable, three-dimensional people right out of the real world and the story constantly moves forward from one hilarious moment to the next. This movie shows that it really does not need name actors and millions of dollars to create true entertainment. The actors are well cast and fit their parts perfectly (especially Virginia Bryan who is delightful to watch). This movie is a masterpiece in independent low-budget film-making as it never looks like a "cheap" movie and the story never feels like a low-budget story. I hope to see more of Casper's work in the future, he deserves a wonderful career.
