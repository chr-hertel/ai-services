Certainly a very different Hindi movie, not the usual happy family type drama! I am sure this movie shocked quite a few people, but I think it was quite an original plot. Rani looks amazing as always, and though Preity looks quite old, she manages to pull off the glamorous fashion magazine executive look with her usual giggles and bubbly personality. Everyone acted very well and were well chosen for the roles. Nice songs and a very realistic movie,especially keeping in mind the Indian culture. The movie is quite funny in the first half, but does drag a bit in the second half. Overall, it makes sense and could be appreciated if one watches it with an open mind. Would certainly recommend it.
