I was really happy with this one,, it pretty much tells all of the pratfalls of dating, what to do,, what not to do.. now i did not watch this with my wife, i ain't that stupid. Seeing Jen's butt was nice in the movie,, i thought Vincent Donofrio's part should have been bigger though. I also thought that John Favreau was a riot in this one,, even funnier than Vince Vaughn , if that's possible,, i hated the character of Richard i'm sorry the guy was a total fruit. I liked the bowling alley scenes, very surreal. The condo which they share was a unique idea.. he has his "space" , and she has hers. I wasn't all that sad at the way the movie turned out. This is a great comedy, but also tells a very good story, about dating, and what couples go through during the process. I would definitely recommend this to anyone,, just one thing though,, couples should NOT watch this together, as i think it would provoke a big fight..
