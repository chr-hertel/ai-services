I think we have all waited for the day the Jackie Chan and jet Li get together and do something. This was the best idea they could've had. It was visually delightful. Everything was great and they were so funny. I did not think that Jet Li could pull it off but he just proved that he is not just a martial artist he is also an actor.They worked perfectly together and the movie told a great fantasy story. There were lots of loops and unexpected things and it was fantastic. Jackie Chan will be a legend. No one can do what he has and maintain his humility. Not only is he great at every part of movie making but as a person. I HIGHLY recommend it.
