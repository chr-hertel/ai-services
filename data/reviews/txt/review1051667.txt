When the movie started the audience thought something was wrong with the audio, but then you realize that what you're seeing here is a sincere movie follows along 4 men as they seek out a better life. If you accept this movie for what it is - a combination of fly on wall technique and a personal narrative - a drive through the deserts of the U.S. will never be the same. After seeing this movie I sincerely hope we find a solution to the immigration problem between my country and the U.S. Until that happens, more people will die and this movie will be a peek into what it's like to risk everything to find a job. Hopefully, enough people see this movie so they'll think twice about the current methods of migration for Mexican workers in the U.S.
