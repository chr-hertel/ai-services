Legend of a Fighter is one of the extremely few totally engaging and at the same time totally realistic kung fu movies. Nobody becomes a master overnight; oh no, the movie jumps ahead 12 years to show that it damn well takes time to master a decent kung fu style!

The fight scenes are nothing less than stupendous. This is old school wireless fighting at its best, helmed by Hong Kong's premiere martial arts choreographer, not to mention the stellar fighting skills of the great Ka-Yan Leung.

The story is also good, although the end, with the entire national honor of China at stake, perhaps stretches credibility a bit. But the yarn is structured very well, so the audience is engaging their emotions in the story, right up to the end.

If you're looking for a really good, classic kung fu movie with lots of action and lots of intensity, you can't do much better than this.

My rating: 9 out of 10.
