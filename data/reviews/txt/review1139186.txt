In the olden days of television all the news anchors where manly men, who were idolized by everyone who watched news. The most manly of all was Ron Burgundy (Will Farfrel) who is challenged by a beautiful Veronica (Christina Applegate), who intends to be the first female anchor.

Most funny jokes are drawn from the "macho culture" of the news group (gang fights between different news groups and such) and the chauvinistic attitude of the other male members of the news group.

AS for comedies go "Anchorman" is filled with different kinds of characters, which of some work or are just unnecessary in some aspect.

Perhaps not the best comedy ever made, but certainly worth a view.
