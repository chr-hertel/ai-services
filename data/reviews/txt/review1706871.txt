I sat about 40 feet from the screen and could not see the fight or chase scenes. Why? Apparently it's really "hip" to employ UNsteadicam now. The camera was constantly moving randomly as if the "steady" part of the steadicam apparatus had been removed. There's hardly a fixed camera or dolly shot in the entire movie. The constant close-ups made this "nervous" movement even more distracting and indiscernible. I can only see viewing this on a home screen or in the back of the theater.The director should have taken into account when you blow up the picture you amplify any camera movements exponentially.Sort of ruined the film for me.
