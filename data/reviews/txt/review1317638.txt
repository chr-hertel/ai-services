My favorite book, brief, suspenseful, and frighteningly real in scope and character. Having recently lived through Katrina as a physician at various aid stations, rescue squads into the city, etc. it brought me back to this book and a film I saw when I was in my early teens. It speaks of the tragedy of modern life, where apathy can settle like dust and no one is responsible for their neighbor. The riverside town in the heart of Colombia, trapped in an absurd past where an unspoken code of conduct is barbarously enforced (against even the enforcers' wishes, I might add), is fleshed out masterfully. This is one remake I am desperately hoping I live to see, and one movie I wish I could see again.
