****Possible Spoiler Warning**** I saw the movie on Friday and I was already a little disappointed because of it's running time being extremely short. But none the less it's a great superhero movie! The beginning starts out with kind of the same feel as the first movie a few jokes here and there, okay there are plenty of jokes, but near the middle and end it has a darker better feel to it, besides the jokes some of the ending reminded me of X2: Xmen United. Despite it's run time it's a great superhero film and one of Marvel's most enjoyable films of all time! The film did much better than I thought it would with it's great CGI, Great action, and a great plot. I definitely recommend you to go and see this at you nearest theater and I'm definitely gonna get the DVD when it comes out. I was unsure if Tim Story could pull it off but somehow he did. I give this film a 10 out of 10 for being an excellent movie.
