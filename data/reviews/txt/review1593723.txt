John Carpenter was once known as the master of horror (or at least part of the new wave of directors in the '70s), but more recently seems to have been regarded with some scorn, with most critics saying that his movies got totally trashy. To tell you the truth, "Vampires" looks like it's trying to be trashy. Specifically, it looks almost like Carpenter got a bunch of people together to party, they filmed it, and added a bunch of gore in post-production (I admit that I just made all that up as I thought about it).

But anyway, this movie is a pretty amusing romp, as James Woods leads a group of hunters trying to stop a centuries-old vampire (Thomas Ian Griffith) from finding a relic and becoming fully immortal. None of the overwrought pomp from "Bram Stoker's Dracula", just pure unadulterated fun; absolutely no pretense whatsoever. Definitely the sort of movie that you watch with best buds. Also starring Daniel Baldwin, Sheryl Lee, Maximilian Schell and Tim Guinee.

Back when Sheryl Lee played Astrid Kirchherr in "Backbeat", who would have ever guessed that she would later star in a John Carpenter movie?
