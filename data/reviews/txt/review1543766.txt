yep i too was sent this self erasing video tape as a marketing exercise in December 2006 and cottoned on pretty quickly once the adverts came on that it was not about the terrible sitcom. Feel like i have watched that video on 'the ring' and something bad will happen to me for being sucked into it. 

I guess this dismal sitcom is destined to be used for pimping products and will never actually see the light of day. The actors must be rather embarrassed to say the least. bad enough to make the pilot, but to then have it shown 9 years later to a critical audience. 

Wow - some blow to the ego.
