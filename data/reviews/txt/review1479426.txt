Just finished watching this movie with my 16 year son, who was skeptical about it after seeing modern day screwball comedies like "Old School." He loved it.

Unlike at least one other reviewer, I thought Chevy Chase was great through-out the movie. With all the over the top comedy through-out the movie, it's easy to miss Chevy with Ted Knight and Rodney Dangerfield's over the top performances. Chevy clearly has some of the best lines, delivered so off-the-cuff as to be easily missed.

Bill Murray may be at his comedic best in this movie playing underplaying an over-the-top character with great effect. He's so funny, it's easy to spend your time watching this movie in eager anticipation of when he'll again be on screen.

Rodney Dangerfield is classic Rodney Dangerfield in a part that had to be written just for him. Much of his schtick is just as tired as Rodney looks, but all is delivered with his usual "I've got a squirrel in my pants" style. If you're a fan of Rodney, there's lots to like about him in the movie. If you hate him, though, be warned: his screen time will wear on you like nails on a chalkboard.

Ted Knight in a pseudo-Ted Baxter performance fits his role perfectly. If you grew up watching him on the Mary Tyler Moore show, you'll get more of the same.

Michael O'Keefe and Tony D'Annunzio play good counterpoints to each other in underdeveloped, but clich√©d roles of "average nice guy" and "hip, cool guy" to Cindy Morgan's smokin' hot chick. (She is gorgeous!) Sarah Holcomb's Irish looks and accent are a joy. Too bad this was her last film.

Plenty of great characters with at least six or more mixed up plot lines held loosely together by the golfing theme and intersecting liberally. The setting automatically excuses most of the dating of the movie. Hey, everyone knows golfers have no fashion sense.
