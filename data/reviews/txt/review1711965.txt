The storyline for this one is oddly close to Fran√ßois Ozon's Swimming Pool. Although you hardly get a body shot half as good as Sagnier's lying by the pool, at least you have Bouyxou and Rollin in the credits, and that merely puts the film on a higher range of "Worth Seeing" than Swimming Pool (just find the caps of Sagnier and run). Now that would be a mistake to believe this film is worth seeing though, because it sucks except for that book editor called "Du Genoux". That's funny right ? But not enough to keep you awake. ONLY for Rollin fans, or diggers of pornography on film. Well, I know one, and I must thank him for the experience... but that's clearly not the film you wanna see if you'd like to discover the hidden secrets of classic french pornography.
