I have carefully avoided seeing this thing for the last two years. However, when Gibson burst forth with his vile anti-semitic rant last week, I thought now is the time to compare the movie with the rant. On a vileness scale the movie comes in as a 10 to the rant's 8.

But, my biggest objection is that this movie is just not believable. To depict Pilate as afraid (or even moderately respectful) of Caiphas is a joke. Remember, Judea was a militarily occupied land. Pilate was Caesar's number one boy, beholden only to Caesar. Jesus was a local do-gooder, upsetting the Roman realm. An early times Gandhi, Martin Luther King.

Fairy tales are succor for the faithful, so I guess if you're more interested in faith than fact this one is right up your street.
