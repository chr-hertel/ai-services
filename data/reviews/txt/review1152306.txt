I really loved this movie! I just loved the way the characters Tom and Eli interacted together as well as the way their friends worked to set them up. I could really relate to the frustration and, at times anger, that Eli was going through trying to figure out the mixed messages that Tom was sending him. It was great seeing one of the characters who was having problems coming to terms with his own wish/need for lasting love grapple with his demons and finally allow himself to reach out and touch some real happiness. At the end of the movie I was in tears. This movie has it all: comedy, tragedy, and a heart-wrenching resolution. Every gay person and and their straight friend(s) should see this movie!
