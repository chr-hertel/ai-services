I agree with you 100%, at least a top 10 movie of all time. Don't worry about their top 250 however; The Empire Strikes Back is #9 and is the worst of the originals and probably worse than a couple of the re-made first three episodes. My father, born just outside of Glasgow, was nearly brought to tears when he saw this movie for the first time. A man I've only see cry once when my oldest brother left for college. It remains one of the handful of movies that he will watch over and over again. You're exactly right, the violence is necessary, it only makes the movie more powerful and the hardships that the Scotch had to endure while fighting for their independence hit home that much more. So keep fighting, this movie will find its rightful place at the top.
