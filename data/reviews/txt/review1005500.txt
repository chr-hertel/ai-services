This has got to be the worst film that I have ever seen. It is so rubbish that I was prepared to kill myself. Luckily I didn't do that. Otherwise I wouldn't be here to write this. Some people may like it but the writers and crew have mucked up so much. They mixed up Shakespeare and Modern times. If they were clever they would have chosen one or the other. They also left electric lights on the Christmas tree. I'm ashamed. Ashamed. I recommend you do not watch it. I was forced to but don't watch it, unless being forced to. Though i did like Feste. He was acted very well. Unfortunately, it was the only thing good about this film.
