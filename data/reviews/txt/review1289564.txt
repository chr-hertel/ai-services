I have to say honestly that when I first started seeing trailers for this movie I had no intentions whatsoever of seeing it at all. I had seen the previews and they just didn't really spark my interest.

I have just seen this movie for the first time tonight and I can say that it would have been a huge mistake for me not to see it,as well as it will be a huge mistake for you should you choose not to see this movie. In fact, I enjoyed it so much that after watching it with my parents and other miscellaneous family members, that I borrowed it from them and took it home to watch with my wife. She loved the film as much as I did.

It is a great movie for either gender, male or female. Perfect for watching whether by yourself, or with friends, but best watched with a loved one. Enough romance to keep the ladies happy but not so much that it turns it solely into a "Chick Flick".

Don't even waste your time or money with bothering to rent this movie. Just go buy it. Definitely one you will want in your collection.

I give it 9/10.
