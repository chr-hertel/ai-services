Director Christopher Nolan continues his brilliantly redefined depiction of Batman and the world of Gotham with "The Dark Knight", the crushingly powerful sequel to 2005's excellent "Batman Begins". Everything about this movie is right on the mark, its elements fusing masterfully to create a work that far surpasses what might be expected of the typical comic book hero film.

The movie wastes no time grabbing our attention with every kind of method that works, from intense action sequences to intelligent, necessary character development. Nolan once again selects an all star cast to create compelling characters that we can care about. Although the plot is basically a traditional good guys vs. bad guys routine, the movie is chock-full of character quirks and situational complexities that lend themselves toward the unfolding of not a typical action-thriller, but rather a comprehensive work of art.

There are so many reasons to go see "The Dark Knight". The writing, the performances, the direction, the effects and the movie's setting...they're all top-notch. I found nothing about this movie disappointing, and I'm usually a pretty critical guy. Go see it. It's a juggernaut of talent right across the board.

9.95/10
