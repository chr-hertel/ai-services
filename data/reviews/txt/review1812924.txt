i found this movie to be better than the first one.there's still lots of action,but it's even funnier than the first.there's some really good fight scenes,and Jackie Chan's moves are even more outrageous this time around.the banter between Chan and Tucker is much funnier and more natural.once again,although there is some violence it's not excessive or gratuitous.i think there is also less coarse language than the first,and like the first,there is no nudity,but there is a bit of suggestiveness.overall,i though this movie was a great ride from start to finish.it's even faster paced than the original,and Tucker and Chan have even better general and comedic chemistry.for me,Rush Hour 2 is an 8/10
