It's not just that Woody isn't in it. There is no humor in "Match Point" and -- although I've not seen everything Woody has ever done -- nothing that connects it to the rest of his ouvre. This is a conventional adultery-leading-to-murder film, not the worst of its type but far from the best. If you like Scarlett Johansson (and I do), here's an opportunity to see a good deal of her body, and you also get to see another aspect of her acting talent (in an essentially undemanding role). Johansson may be Woody's latest muse but, if so, he did not succeed in creating a story worthy of her talents or, for that matter, an especially interesting character for her to play. When the great critic in the sky writes down a final verdict on Woody Allen's career, "Match Point" will be down near the bottom of the list of his achievements.
