When I finished watching the movie "Mars Attacks" on television several years ago, I literally stared at the screen and said: "Wow. That's an hour and a half of my life I'll never have back." This movie didn't even try to be good. Why in the good Lord's name did these actors (particularly the several who actually are quite talented) consent to be casted in this bastardization of the film industry? Tim Burton needs to stick to movies like "The Nightmare Before Christmas," because frankly, he can't do much else. This movie followed the standard formula: 

Clich√©d plot +Attempted Humor x Zero Effort = Crap.
