Im not the hugest fan of rock music but i didn't have to be to enjoy the challenging , all thrashing, all strumming fun of guitar heroes 2.

The aim of the game is to use the games guitar controller and hit the peripherals buttons in time with the rhythm of the song on screen . Sounds simple ? Well it is in principle but in practice its a different story: you'll be working your fingers to the bone in attempt to be a gaming rock god and hopefully get that elusive 5 star review ! Music wise there's selection of songs to please even the most demanding guitar enthusiast . Fast , slow, hard , soft , there are all kind of songs to try out , including jams from the likes of alice in chains,rage against the machine, sting, guns and roses and more .

Whether you like to raaaaaaaaaaaaaawk or not, you'll enjoys hours of addictive rhythm action with guitar heroes 2. I know i did.
