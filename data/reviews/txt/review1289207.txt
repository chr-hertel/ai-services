I appreciate the ground breaking photography, but two hours of no dialog and a crappy piano soundtrack isn't my idea of a good time. Keep in mind that this silent movie pioneered many of the common special effects that every film maker and TV producer still users today! It is a must have for my personal collection, but I would rather exploit it than watch it.

I just bought into a new movie that incorporates some of the Metropolis footage and is built around an "acid jazz" surround sound audio track called "The Fisher Prince - Wake Up Your Destiny". I think all the old silent movies should be redone in this way, and I am doing what I can to make this happen. Cut the redundancy, get a great soundtrack, and keep it short like my attention span!

The Metropolis actors may do a great job, considering acting was a relatively new profession in 1927. I like the story line. But I hate the dialog your are supposed to read. The Fisher Prince has no dialog - written or spoken. I think the sound should be most of the production and the visuals should take a smaller role. I want a movie where I can eat, drink, talk to people and catch a visual now and then, but listen to an excellent soundtrack... Only "The Fisher Prince" and other mini-movies like it broadcasting at Club Shag in Arlington, Virginia can give you this.... - Sam
