What IS it with Uwe Boll?

Bloodrayne was a highly successful video & computer game where an attractive Dhampir? woman killed Nazis and drank their blood. Good show!

So of course, UWE comes along and sets the film version in Medieval Europe.

Then, much to my surprise, the store advertises the release of Bloodrayne 2. This time it is set in the old west of the United States. Joe R. Lansdale specializes in those kind of western/horror hybrids, but Uwe?

I can only hope that if there is a Bloodrayne 3 we will finally get to see some Nazis die.

Maybe he just doesn't want to see Germans suffer?
