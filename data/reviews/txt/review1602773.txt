all set in a registry office Come Fly with me was superb. at last something very funny on TV! Great writing and acting. Should be developed as a series. Like the best American comedy. wasted on daytime. more. HannaH waterman was very very sad and funny and the other cast were great . It was pacey. It was moving . It was funny funny. Let's hope they do more of these next year. Hope these plays are released on DVD. well done. Hannah waterman should be given her own series soon. The direction was fast, clever and colourful. Kate isset was brilliant in Coupliung and her comic talents were truly on display here. It was great to see jack Deam from the brilliant Shameless playing the nice guy who can't get love. The little cameos were spot on also
