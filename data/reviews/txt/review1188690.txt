I remember when I first went to see this movie. I was 14 and when I was going to turn 17 I was determined to join the army - u know, spend the summer with friends, learn new things, meet new people, and most importantly be a soldier for my country.

All that changed in the first 5 minutes of this movie. I have never had a movie impact me so much. To all of you who are so full of yourselves that the only things you can say are: "So typical of American movies, always making movies about Americans" or "Typical Spielberg, displaying the allies as the good guys and portraying the Germans as the bad guys." You people make me sick. Forget about your prejudice towards America, just watch the movie and understand the message about war that its trying to bring out! And for those of you who can honestly sit there and feel sorry for the portrayal of the Nazis, you are the reason I wanted to join the army in the first place, to put people like you in your place.

Anyways, terrific movie, definitely set the new standard for war movies. Still one of my top 5 movies.
