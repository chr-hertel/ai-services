I haven't been on the edge of my seat for ages in the cinema, but star wars delivers yet again. this film is a return to form for George Lucas, and even those that found episode one and two annoying have something to enjoy here. Anakin's decent into the darkside is both emotional and exciting. Although the Chemistry between Padme and Anakin is still a little fishy, its the Anakin/Obi wan dynamic that is truly inspirational. Emporer Palpatine steals every scene that he's in and Mace Windu gets the ending that Sam Jackson always wanted, not to go out like some punk. Its great to see the star wars saga go out with a bang.
