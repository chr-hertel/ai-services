Just how good is Metal Gear Solid 2? This game single handedly made me want to get a PS2. The first time I saw saw the graphics I was stunned. The game play is better than the original, the story, while complex, is on par with the the first Metal Gear Solid. The one complaint MANY have is the main character, Raiden. Yes, he is not as bad ass as Snake, but get over it! That's one of the very few bad things in this game. The boss fights are more intense, the characters more interesting, and the dialogue is quote worthy. To this day there are games that can't match MGS2's graphics, and can't match anything else as a whole. Is it better than the original? That's entirely up to you, but they both get 10's from me.
