If you enjoy vomiting, crap throwing and smearing, burping, farting, farting on people's faces, booger picking, and booger eating... then this is just the movie for you! This movie is a 6th-grader's feast! I say movie, not film, because it would never rank (pun) being called a film, much less draw dignity from any critics or reviewers.

Aside from that, it has an interesting plot twist and a few moments here and there. Once you get past all the bodily functions you might even have a bit of fun seeing this once... but don't watch and eat your dinner at the same time!

In the end, this was a quick buck aimed at the grade-schoolers using 2nd rate, unemployed, or desperate actors... more power to them I suppose. At least they didn't pretend to have made a serious work.

Put this in your "Pre-Teen" category, or, not quite a "Teen" movie...
