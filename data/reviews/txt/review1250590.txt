That's really it. This director is a god-damn genius. The script is so funny and the love story so on the money. Everyone talks about Kingsley, and he's great of course (he got the Oscar nod but lost to Broadbent) but the truth of the matter is the whole ensemble is terrific. Dee Dee, and H and Teddy, these characters are all time greats, And Winstone...forget about it, he makes Kingsley powerful. Winstone's got him by a hundred pounds but you believe he's afraid of Ghandi..I love him. I'd walk a mile on my hands and knees through broken glass just to have him pee on my toothbrush. If you haven't seen Birth yet, check it out. This guy Glazer scares me he's so talented check out the Radiohead videos while you're at it.
