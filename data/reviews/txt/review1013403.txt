It was so nice to see all those stars from one of my favorite sitcoms. I enjoyed seeing these folks as they look today. The special was not just some collections of clips from the old series. It included stories about the people that were a part of that adventure. And Gary Marshall was there to add his perspective and insights. It was interesting to hear about his interaction with his cast. 

Henry Winkler's "home movies" showed us things that have not been seen before. He had little gems that he shot over the full eleven years the show was produced. 

I particularly enjoyed the stories about their softball team. They played in many locations including games against the troops overseas. It was fun to see who was the star player and who was not. I won't spoil that here. I'll just say that being one of the more significant cast members did not mean you were also one of the more significant softball players.

And while this was not just a re-hashing of clips from old shows, it did include some highlights. I saw characters I had forgotten. I'm going to have to watch the local TV schedule for some repeats. Happy Days will always be one of the best TV series ever made.
