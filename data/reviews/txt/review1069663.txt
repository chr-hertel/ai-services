Billy Zane plays Jack, a wealthy Texas businessman who takes a trip with his trophy wife, Jennifer, played by Kelly Brook in a private yacht in the South Seas. Things go wrong however, when the yacht sinks. Jennifer and Manuel, the hired help, find their way to a deserted tropical island. Together, they set up a little paradise and explore their sexual desires. It is not long until Jack washes up onto the same beach. He is alive and thus complicates the situation on the island. Jealousies and conflicts escalate and these three people have to survive not only the elements but also themselves as tensions become deadly. 

Billy Zane delivers a solid performance as always and Kelly Brook is reminiscent of Nicole Kidman in Dead Calm: a captivating natural beauty. In fact, Brook was named 'sexiest woman in the world' by FHM magazine.
