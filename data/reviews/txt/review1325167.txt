Continuity error at beginning of movie when he's at train station. He misses his initial train and stands under pouring rain getting soaking wet. When he catches the next train 20 minutes later, he's completely dry and meets Jennifer Aniston looking very suave and well-kept.

He then goes into work and there he looks damp and his hair is all tousled. The acting seems fair to good and the plot holds your attention.

Jennifer looks gorgeous as always and the screen chemistry between the two of them doesn't seem very believable. She's definitely out of his league.
