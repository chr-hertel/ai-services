You will enjoy this movie in a dark room with good speakers and a good size TV. This movie has a great story line, something that you can follow and think about.

I remember when we first seen this movie, we were enjoying the movie, then unexpectedly; pop corns, chips and chocolate were flying around in the cinema. That was the first experience I have ever had with a scary scene like that, even my bits of chocolate were on the floor. I have watched other thrillers, none of them made it this far.

There are a lot of people I met who have different opinions to what the movie is about, but it is important to think about what the writer thought because its from his views.
