OMG!!! This is NOT at all what i thought it would be. No- this is WAY better. Silent Hill is originally a horror computer game for the playstation 2, and like so many other games with a massive storyline, it been turned into a movie. The Resident Evil series did it, the alone in the dark series did it, but Silent hill is the first of them to capture a really interesting story, and a satisfying plot. The actors are great, and you can tell that the director really knew his part of the games characters, and how to get it on film. Well done! As a computergame salesman, i really wanted to see this movie. But after many of the above named from-game-to-movie titles, my expectations was not of the highest. Directors often have little respect for the games story and universe, and often let's own ideas interfere with the game-story. But this one completely took me by surprise. The whole Silent Hill atmosphere is so well kept, that you even recognize most of the locations, identical to the ones in the game. Everything has been captured perfectly, and i can not describe how awesome the visuals and special effect worked in the film.

The plot itself is of the highest quality. The writer really fought, and won, to prevent this from becoming another "Doom"! The best from-game-to-film so far! BRAVO!!!
