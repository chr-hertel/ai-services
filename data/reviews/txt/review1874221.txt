"That's the coolest thing I've ever seen" -Terrence Howard "as" Jim Rhodes ----------------------- Thank you America for ruining artistic development with your paychecks towards our intellectual retardation that we spread THREW OUT THE WORLD.

Commercials sell, this one was entertaining, but yet, acting, actors, story and direction all ham and geared toward no sided politics, is a cheap stab at greater good story arcs. This movie is what sells and what is good about our country, $10 at the theater and a costumed hero on a McDonald's super size cup. just like your imagination for buying into this is the equivalent of fast food. The yellow pictures being the established character and actors. Like having Robert Downey Jr. who's life would at least like to be a polar opposite in standards. I like him but please we cannot forget. So I find that amusing, along with the peppered script of good goody, gee gollies dialog. every one in the movie is a parody of the character, even Jeff Bridges whom I'm sure only did this one to play a bad guy. half way threw the plot.

Remember Fire engine red is the go sign for profit, when it only turns your minds on fire.

So now...
