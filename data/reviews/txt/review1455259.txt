I've always been a fan of adventure movies a la Indiana Jones but when you throw in the mysteries of old Egypt and the pyramids then you have me hooked.

I liked Stargate for what it was... a Hollywood sci fi flick meant to entertain... and i was entertained.

The F/X were OK and i especially liked James Spader who played one of those stereotypical bumbling academic roles with his tongue firmly in cheek. In fact, I think he was the model for Jeff Goldblum in the much bigger Independence Day from the same producer team. Kurt Russel was also OK as the military stereotype.

But like i said, this is Hollywood at its formulaic best.

Worth a watch
