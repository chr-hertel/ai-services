I don't care about the plot of this movie. I knew from the beginning that there will be a big twist. My 11 YO son foresaw it after 10 minutes, and I don't claim he's a genius. What remains from the works of Mr MNS is THE ATMOSPHERE. He can build the atmosphere of fear and apprehension perfectly in ALL his works. Watch "The village" alone at 2 am and U will admit that. The jungle surrounded by torch flames, the kids playing courage games, the apprehension and the anticipation. This s fun.. This s real cinema. MNS is a genius, and I daresay he outdid Hitchcok in creation of suspense. Anyway, the curse of Sixth Sense will haunt him forever. He started from the summit .. Nowhere else to go but down.. Being the genius he is he kept struggling and he kept there, but people keep awaiting his fall eagerly.
