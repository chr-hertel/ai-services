I have never ever seen a TV-show that has made me laugh so hard and made me look away at the same time, because it's so damn awkward.

David Brent, the man who is so full of himself it's frightening, creates situations that is hilarious and extremely awkward.

In a way, his own ego is the main character in this show. He thinks he is the funniest man alive, the greatest boss ever and that he isn't prejudice in any way.

Watch the show and find out how much is actually true.

Recommended for everyone, except anyone who has problems with embarrassing situations. 9/10. Marvelous!
