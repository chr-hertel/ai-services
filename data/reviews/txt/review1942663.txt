French director Fran√ßois Truffaut always had a penchant for stories made for children.He has converted many brilliant stories about innocent children into wonderful films where children have been shown as people with their own psychological problems.L'Infant Sauvage is a different film for children.It must be hailed as a victorious effort for Truffaut.It is one of those rare films which gives full opportunity to its actors to succeed well in order to reveal the truth regarding inexplicable social phenomenon.It is a nice thing that through such a bold film Truffaut has decided to tackle obscurantism which was very much prevalent in the past.For those who have seen Kaspar Hauser directed by Werner Herzog,it is quite natural that certain comparisons would surely be made.However,it must however be kept in mind that although both of these films dealt with almost the same topic historical topic,their treatment is different from one another.It is because of Jean Pierre Cargol that "L'Enfant Sauvage" appears to be a purely,authentic tale of how a country doctor restored the dignity of a human being.
