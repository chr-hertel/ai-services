SPOILER : I hate to waste any more of my personal time to write a comment for this horrible film. But if this comment is read by any aspiring viewer, shall at least be saved from spending three dreadful hours of his life.

One of the finest Director of India suddenly presents us his worst offering. Sadly this film is so shocking & horrific, that I cannot describe my foretasted feelings while leaving the cinema hall.

The movie revolves around a Drummer & utterly butterly romantic-girl-flattering-lover boy Shahrukh Khan who doesn't want to bingle with Karisma Kapoor who inturn is in deep love with the former, while the new girl in their block, Madhuri pulsates for Shahrukh with vice versa fashion, finally to see Akshay kumar's future love-life flattered by witnessing the twosome's emotional bond.

So we have the biggest ludicrous dialog put on air "Hey, He is just a friend, I never loved him", "She is just a friend", "I never saw him from love angle" .............................. CAN A BOY & A GIRL BE BEST FRIENDS, HEY CAN TWO BEST FRIENDS FALL IN LOVE .................................. STOP IT !!!! STOP IT !!!! for god's sake this concept sucks.

So these 3 characters keep revolving round & round. The script writer must have written the film in less than 3 hours.

Perhaps this Film is the most senseless movie ever made in Indian cinema history.
