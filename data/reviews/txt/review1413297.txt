Totally entertaining, great special effects, and, a movie you will want to see over and over again! I hope they put out a special edition with deleted scenes, I wanted this movie to go on and on. The blend of characters and the way they work with each other is exceptional, and, having the first movie to set up with, creates a familiarity with the personalities of each returning character which adds to the enjoyment of watching this film. Loved the way the ending was setup and the final scene was so great! I cant wait for the next movie, it should be incredible to watch! The computer generated stuff is getting better all the time seamlessly mixing and melding into the scenes. I cant imagine what will be the next level, I can only dream!
