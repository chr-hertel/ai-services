This documentary is an good portrayal of the experience of the Puerto Rican soldiers of the 65th Infantry.

We get a good amount of history that serves to contextualize the origins of the 65th Infantry and historical elements that contributed to Puerto Ricans joining the army, as well as explaining their behaviors and conducts in war, whether good or bad.

With all of the interviews they including, with soldiers, their superiors and military historian, the viewer is able to understand different aspects of the Puerto Ricans in Korea, as well as the events that occurred before and after the battlefield.

I find, however, that the documentary could have benefited from more interviews from the families in Puerto Rico and their families in the War shaped the reality of Puerto Rico, especially its towns. Their perspective would have been particularly good also for the latter part of the documentary.

Other than that, great documentary! I recommend it.
