Now, this is an underrated Horror movie from Mèxico that had a great potential but sadly, again, the sad story of Mexican low budget cinema came to happen...... I'm talking about poor production values and lack of coherence and continuity. 

Edith Gonzàlez stars as a Criminology Doctor who has recently graduated from college and now gets the opportunity of her life. And that is to study the criminal mind of "El Descuartizador" (Slasher) played by Jorge Reynoso.

In the likes of "Silence Of The Lambs", Gonzalez's character needs to understand his mind in order to develop a new scientific method for Psychology. But things go wrong when the Slasher escapes from the mental institution and starts a killing spree. Man, Reynoso surely knows how to play a psycho! The movie focuses on how Gonzàlez can manage to trap him with the aid of police. She's extremely beautiful and delivers an unbelievable solid dramatic performance. Reynoso is pretty good. Also Arsenio Campos who is an underrated Mexican actor delivers a good performance. 

Watch this movie with low expectations and you might enjoy it. Oh but you may need to ignore the atrocious acting by the mental institution doctors, the putrid score, and horrible amateurish direction. Gee, the doctors deserve a standing ovation for their putrid acting.

This is a good movie for those who are hungry of B-entertainment. And I'm talking about cheap, low budget entertainment.
