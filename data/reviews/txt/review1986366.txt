Today, I decided to listen to the radio version and watch on Google Video the TV version of "The Christmas Story" episode of "The Amos 'n' Andy Show". Both are pretty much the same story word for word and scene for scene. Well, actually, the TV version has an additional scene of the birth of Amos' child Arbadella (Patti Marie Ellis) who nine years later wants a talking doll for Christmas. Her uncle Andy, despite being broke, resolves to get it for her by becoming a Santa's helper in the Globe department store. There he encounters kids both kind and bratty. I'll stop there and mention that Alvin Childress as Amos really shines here especially when he explains to daughter Arbadella what "The Lord's Prayer" really means. Andy himself is more of a sympathetic character here then his usual more slightly naive portrayal. Both Lightnin' and Kingfish provide their own brief amusements. All in all, both the radio and TV version of "The Christmas Story" are very worthy tales for the holiday season. By the way, the Paul Taylor Chrous provided the "The Lord's Prayer" song and "Silent Night" on the radio version from December 22, 1944. And I have to mention that Charles Correll-who played Andy on radio-died in my birthtown of Chicago, Illinois on September 26, 1972. Also Amos' wife Ruby (Jane Adams) was added for the TV version.
