Some comments have pointed out that this is a movie that takes the child's POV. Well, that's true, but many films have done that and the tale they've told is sad (Ponette) or even harrowing (Ã€ ma soeur!). What this film captures is the divine reality that children and some adults are in contact with. It also relates the many other parts of a boy's role in a struggling Jewish Canadian family of the 20's, and does that quite well.

However, the mystery at the heart of life, the divine connection, that's what this film depicts best.

Alas, it's never been released in ANY consumer format! Who do we talk to about this injustice!
