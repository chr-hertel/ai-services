SALEMS LOT is about a guy who goes back to his home town after many years away, and discovers that some things have changed. The town starts getting over-run by vampires and all sorts of havoc breaks loose.

This is one of the GOOD Steven King adaptations. There are a few, but a lot of King stuff is being turned into garbage these days. If you don't believe me, read DREAMCATCHER then watch the film - you'll see what I mean. I'm personally not a huge King fan, have read several of his books and seen most of the film adaptations, but the stuff from this time-frame really was good. SALEM'S LOT has tons of atmosphere and the Nosferatu-like vampires are really freaky looking. The film's FX are a little dated by today's standards, but this can be overlooked. Definitely recommended for any horror/Steven King fan. 8/10
