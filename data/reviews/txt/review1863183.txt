Of course this is a great film: it really lays the human dilemma on the line: does one sacrifice one's comrades to save humanity Or doesn't one have that right? The right to hit back at the Nazis even when they have killed one's wife and children.

I laughed during this film at some trivial thing, and the guy next to me told me not to laugh as it was a serious business. I didn't reply even though I wanted to call him a sheisskopf, or to tell him that I was a Communist and he was a Nazi. He was probably Jewish, as I am, but all he learned from the Nazis was to be self-righteous.

Forgive me for airing my anger here but does anyone else see that in the most serious of moral dilemmas die Menschen is nur sehr komisch?
