This is a very well done, expertly made celebration of a lost era in rock and roll history. This is one "long-awaited" documentary that was well worth the wait. Has a lot of information packed into it, but not boring by any means. Interviews and concert mix together well. Johnny Depp on guitar is a welcome bonus. Who knew? Not me! Have we become too accustomed to the over-hyped & overproduced noise that is palmed off on us as rock music these days to truly appreciate its raw & imperfect - and often superior - roots? Rock And A Hard Place: Another Night At The Agora is proof positive that it's well worth the look and listen! What good music used to sound like... And what it needs to sound like again.
