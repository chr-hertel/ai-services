I recall first seeing this movie on TV in July of 1978 & just by chance as I was sitting on my family room couch I was immediately taken away by both the scenery & narration @ once.By The way the narration is by The Late Burgess Meredith as The Grown up Lucius. Next after that came an interesting aspect of American history when people of any age could drive just by being taught on the spot as that boy Lucius was right after the beautiful scenery of which the film began with.It's very inspirational from start to finish & beyond the film's ending in addition to how as one good when I didn't even ever know of the film's name for 21 years in part because the story & scenery took me away so that I didn't need to know the name in order to be impressed as well as to be taken away through time & imagery & so that in conclusion when I saw the ad for this years later & there was just no mistaking that scenery for another scenery & I then watched it after the ad of which told it was coming up next & to no surprise I was right got to watching it again & now even have it on tape & feel that everyone should as well because it's very awe inspiring & as well as a very educational aspect of our American History & in addition to that knowing another work of William Faulkner's outside "As I Lay Dying." of which I read in American Literature back in 1984.Watch in The Reivers for Will Geer as That grandpa called Boss and before he was made famous as Grandpa Walton.

However If you get the copy of this movie like on the wide screen DVD with both the top and bottom black borders you may like me find it both distracting as well as unnecessary.
