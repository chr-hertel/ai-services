This film is in my top ten loved every minute of it as an ex squaddie I found the banter between the Soldiers to be very authentic.

The film is an action packed adventure / horror the special effects top draw.

The actors are great the interaction between Sean Pertwee and Kevin McKidd is top draw.

The plot is as follows a squad of infantry soldiers are on exercise in Scotland they come across a wounded special forces officer and things go wrong from there.

This film was panned by the critics (another reason to ignore them)
