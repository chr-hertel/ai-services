This felt like if you haven't read the book, you are not invited to understand this movie! This portrays the north north Swedes as the drunkest people in the world, and they might challenge that with the north north people in Finland. This movie is far away from other Swedish movie like My Life as a Dog, Slingshot, As It is in Heaven and even MasDevils. Scenes comes and goes, most of them are bizarre, grotesque, sick, non-relevant and makes no sense to the rest of the story, since most threads is left in the air anyway. Björn Kjellman speaks Skånska as if he was educated at Jan Malmsjö School of fake Skånska academy, and many actors speak as if they forgot what movie they are in and wanders in and out of dialect. Any Åsa-Nisse or Janne Vängman movie when he says "Tjo Flöjt", or Three Stooges, or even Teen-agers from Outer Space has a better story thread than this awful mess.

Avoid this movie!!! This is not what it sounds like! It's not a warm and funny or bittersweet coming of age movie!
