This movie is a bad movie. When I watched this, I had no expectations. I didn't really know what to expect. I was never much of a Batman fan, so I just watched this movie to have some fun.

The first half hour of the movie is excellent. The rest is just bad. Christopher Nolan does not know how to make good action sequences. He just pretends there's an earthquake and shakes the camera a lot. So we don't really see anything.

But the big problem is the plot, the story. Like I said, the first half hour is excellent. Liam Neeson is great, and Christian Bale seems to be a more real, emotional Batman. But then... poof. After the first half hour, the emotion disappears. It just turns to another usual "bad guys have some evil plan to destroy the city" plot. And the emotional, more human Batman also disappears. And instead, we get the usual Batman... just another super-hero. But this time, he's in crappy action sequences. Chrsitian Bale doesn't need to act. Because it's just bad action sequences after bad action sequences, and he just needs to say his lines without emotion. It's the action that matters. Because it's just another blockbuster. And then there's the terrible twist, that completely ruins Liam Neeson's character.

Fortunately, Katie Holmes saves the movie.

(Note: I'm being ironic. Katie Holmes is TERRIBLE, and she needs some acting lessons).

So, overall, what is Batman Begins? Well, it's a blockbuster. With bad action sequences. And a story with no heart. The first half hour is excellent, but that doesn't make up for two hours of bad cinema.

It's just a bad movie.
