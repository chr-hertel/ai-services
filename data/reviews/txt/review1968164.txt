I watched saw 5 last week in the cinema. I did not go in with any expectations. It was one of the best horror films that I've seen in a very long time and its memorable. Tobin Bell's acting was very good, once again. I think its better than saw 4, but not better than the others. Personally, i liked the concept of their not being too much blood and gore in this film. Furthermore, it one of the very few films that actually scared me, once i had left the theatre.

Overall, you will like it if your a saw fan, or somebody who likes suspense films. Personally, i would see it again on DVD. However, if only go in for the blood and gore, then you will be very disappointed.

I give this film 9.5/10.
