There are lots of comments on this film. A feature film from Colombia! Well, that's not exactly true, because this film was made with french money and producers.

Fernando Vallejo is, by far, considered the best living writer in Spanish. Wow! Will this dismiss the idea that Garcia Marquez is the best writer in the world. Well, no, and yes. Fernando Vallejo is one of the most straight forward writers in any language. He uses prose as poetry and vice versa. His narrative is full of ludicrous contradictions devised by his own experience and his point of view of life and religion.

He may be one of the most explosive writers ever, because of two facts: he can't see the grays in between. His life is as black and white as possible. So, his position is always one of extremes.

The script was completely written by him, not only based on his novel. It is as faithful as possible to it with the exception that his kids kill more than one hundred people! He's directed some other films while living in Mexico, to depict the Colombian tragedy. These films were banned in Colombia.

I recommend to all the viewers of this film not to regard it as a Shroeder film, but as a Vallejo film. Shroeder shot the whole thing with Vallejo behind his shoulder. Even the actor they cast is Vallejo himself, except for some very subtle features.

If you could read his work, maybe you'll find out many explanations to his anguish and horror -and love, that seem to be exactly on the same plane.
