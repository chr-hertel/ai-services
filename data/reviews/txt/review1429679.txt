Saw this movie for the first time my senior year of high school and haven't been the same since. Anyone who wants a glimpse into the world of the young, black and powerful should see this movie, not only for the fictional portrayal of gansta thug life but for the superstar cast that pull of one of the most vivid and compelling film plots of all time. The cinematography is absolutely outstanding, and the true beauty of the movies lies in the small details: the look on Kisha's face after her sack session with Tommy; the film Gummo playing in Tommy's house, a reference to the bleak childhoods experienced by the main characters; and I'm pretty sure that one of the performers at the Jamaica party is Sean Paul. Regardless, if you have never seen the movie before, grab a Dutchie, roll a big fat one, get comfy on the couch and just let the story envelop you. Your respect for black culture will multiply to the benefit of yourself and the world.
