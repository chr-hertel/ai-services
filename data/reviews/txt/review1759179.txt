I agree that this show is amusing. I heard Terry Gross interview the writers on Fresh Air and it was a very amusing interview with clips of the show. I saw one episode and will be looking forward to seeing more. Hopefully it will not turn into "Saved By The Bell" or something similar when the writers and, more importantly, the advertisers get tired of portraying Americans as totally ignorant of any culture other than the mall culture for which they are familiar. I think it's important to convey how ignorance is part of all of our lives. On the other hand, if the characters don't grow and move ahead then this show will spin it's wheels in the sand and probably become as inane as "Saved By The Bell".....I know, I know "Saved" is wildly popular as I see countless people watching it while on the treadmill at the gym in the morning. These are ADULTS but I think they watch that show for the Baywatch Factor. But instead of big breasted babes in swimsuits it's nerdy, cute, and MORONIC high school kids that never get out of high school.
