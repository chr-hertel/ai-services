Hilarious best describes this 1966 Oscar nominated film for best picture.

The laughter actually begins when a Russian submarine, commanded by Theodore Bikel, runs aground off the coast of a small New England town. The problem is not only the submarine but the absolute craziest people who reside in the town.

Carl Reiner and Eva Marie Saint and their "children" are in the town for the summer to not only vacation but for Reiner, a playwright, to come up with a perfect topic for a show. Little does he know what's in store for him.

The appearance of the submarine sets off absolute mayhem and hysteria in the town. Alice Foss, a riotous Tessie O'Shea, is tied up with Reiner in a hysterical scene. After freeing herself from being tied up, veteran pro Doro Merande rides around in a motorcycle carrying the sign alert. Then there's Fendel, played by Paul Ford, who wants to organize a militia to fight the invaders. Ben Blue is riding up and down with his horse to announce the invasion of the Russians.

In the midst of all this there is a love interest between John Philip Law, one of the Russian sailors who comes on shore, with the Reiner-Saint daughter.

Things really come to a monumental showdown until a child gets stuck at the top of the church tower. Both the Russians and townspeople work together to free the endangered child.

A good laugh is had by all. See how people of any group can come together when an emergency calls.
