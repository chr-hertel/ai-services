Just got back from watching SILENT HILL. had to come on here and comment. Absolutely fantastic... no qualms what so ever. Loved the Pyramid Head. Brilliant CG animation, not too much or too little. Personally the sound didn't give the same feeling as the games but VERY close. I did have a little problem with the ending as it was a little inconsistent to the games, also i think that for viewers who have never played the games it may be a little difficult to grasp but go and see it none the less. Will definitely be a classic! I will say though, not really for the skirmish... lots of blood. Should really have been an 18... censors kinda screwed up in my opinion.

Really, go and see it... not boring for a second. Not too miss!!!
