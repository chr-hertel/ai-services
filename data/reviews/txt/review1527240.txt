Wow. What can I say? Well, nothing to justify the absolute mind-bending Anime that I thankfully picked up on DVD. Akira tells us the story of Neo-Tokyo in utter turmoil, just after a massive war, in which the cause is unknown for a lot of the movie. Motorbike gangs rule the road, but when Tetsuo is taken away by the government after a collision with a mysterious boy, all hell breaks loose as he is put under scientific experiments.

The animation is fantastic, impossible to tell that it was made nearly 20 years ago. It has probably the most stunning landscapes and detail that I have ever seen in an animation, bar none. The story is complex and thought provoking, not short of hidden messages and subtle references to the holocaust. It paces along nicely and never fails to keep a viewer tense and interested. It's moving, mind--blowing, intense action-fantasy that won't fail to keep you entertained.
