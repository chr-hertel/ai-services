This movie is really, really bad. The "action" is weak if not say not existent in this movie. The "acting" is absolutely ridiculous. I bought the German DVD for 5 .

One has to be really angry to have paid for this piece of.... It is not even that funny if you're just going to watch it to have a good time with a trash masterpiece even though the German dubbed version is quite funny as the voices sound like in an old porn flick.

BUT...there's gotta be a but. Otherwise I would have given only 1/10.

The cover of this movie is about the best one I have ever seen. Just watch the front cover. Brilliant! The back cover however is what really (and I'm not joking!) makes this movie worth buying - even for 10 ! There are rarely any movies which made me have such a good time as the text on the back cover did. I cannot possibly translate this into English without loosing some its fun.

I heard about empty covers and packages which are sold on ebay sometimes. In this case you Won't get fooled. The cover's all you need!
