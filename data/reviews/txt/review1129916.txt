I had hoped to see some really funny material here.

Perhaps I just didn't get it.

Or perhaps the gags really are lame.

I don't recommend this movie.

There were some jabs aimed at a few of the rather ridiculous type folks.

Those who the wise don't take seriously.

Such as a TV evangelist who says "take it all with you." Sorry but a great deal of the acting was no better than what I saw in the senior class play held by the local high school in 1965.
