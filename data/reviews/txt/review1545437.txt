I avoided this film like the plague when it came out mainly because of the hype and that fact that Reeves was in it. By mistake, one night, I started watching it without realising what it actually was I was totally sucked in.

Whilst I don't know the comics or the history I found the film to be dark enough, pretty fast paced and in all fairness not overly Special Effects laden as were most of the films out then.

If anything the film made me sit up and take notice and actually want to find and read the comics. I might almost be tempted to say a sequel would be cool based on the number of characters and story lines that could easily come from this.

cheers,.
