Well, it seems that there have been a surplus of movies based on Japanese horror style movies. But unlike most (namely "The Ring", "The Grudge", etc.) this film has a certain factor(Jennifer Connelly) that the other movies lacked... Jennifer Connelly is superb as Dahlia Williams, her classic performance as an intensely tormented woman is in a word intense, not to mention the Presence of the two young stars ( Ariel Gabe, as well as Perla Haney-Jardine better known as B.B. Kiddo in Kill bill Vol.2). The movie in itself is more of a drama than a thriller, but it does cause moments of pure fear, "Seat jumping" experiences. The plot is Credible, although at times may seem Fantastical . It seems more like a tale of an emotionally distressed mother suffering from the stress of single parenting; whilst being hounded by a pestering ex-husband, than a special effects ridden movie about "Dark Water".. If your a Jennifer Connelly fan I know you will love it... If your not a Jennifer Connelly fan than see it for the fact that the movie itself is good.. I would see it again, and I don't say that about most movies.
