I just saw this film this evening on the eve of it's release in Calgary. I was pleasantly surprised to find something which challenges the mind and does not give it's answers easily. Between unique scene changes and shocking camera angles the watcher is really taken for a ride.There are scenes that I found difficult to watch but at no point would I say any gratuitous violence was shown. Again, this is refreshing as too many Hollywood films rely on shock value and big bangs to carry them. Stay is a much more intellectual adventure. I would definitely see this film a couple of times and I highly recommend it.
