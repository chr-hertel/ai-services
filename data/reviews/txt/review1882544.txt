By now I realize that Quentin Tarantino is a big promoter of girl power (well that and the "N" word). Just look at Jackie Brown, Kill Bill Vols 1 & 2, Sin City to a certain extent, and this latest one: Grindhouse Deathproof. By the trailers I thought this movie would be absurd. I mean: a guy killing people with his car?? I figured it was Christine with an actual person behind the wheel doing the damage. It was surprisingly a lot better than what it seemed. There was plenty of character development being that there was not all killing all the time. The movie could have been considered slow, but Tarantino usually has a vivacious script with very little drab banter.

I was rooting hard for the chicks. These girls I didn't mind rooting for either. They weren't the ultra tough b****es that can take on the whole world, yet they weren't cupcakes either. They were just the right look, just the right attitude and just the right personality to root for.
