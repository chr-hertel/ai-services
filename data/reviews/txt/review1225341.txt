Highly unusual drama concerning an English soldier (Forest Whitaker) who is kidnapped by an underground Irish Army, eventually befriending his captor (Stephen Rea), which leads to a complicated series of personal entanglements involving the soldier's lover (the mysterious Jaye Davidson). Exceptionally well-made picture from canny director Neil Jordan, who also penned the screenplay and won an Oscar. Too bad the third act is so convoluted, and the final scene so banal, that a slight dissatisfaction clouds the overall result. Nevertheless, a daring and provocative piece with excellent performances. **1/2 from ****
