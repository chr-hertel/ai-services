Read the summary for the full plot. What I want to talk about is Carmela, who really comes into her own here. Meadow is applying to colleges. Jeannie Cusamano has some connection to an Ivy league school. Carmela decides a little help from Jeannie couldn't hurt. She asks Jeannie nicely enough at first to help her out regarding Meadow. Jeannie ain't all that excited about the idea. Carmela then becomes distinctly menacing, enough to shake Jeannie to her roots and to rush to do what Carmela demands of her. This is an interesting turn of events, coming from a woman who deplores what her husband does for a living. It shows her to be as cunning and merciless as he, at least when she wants something. This little scenario will all come to a head in another episode or two, but here is the first episode where we see the hypocrisy and downright evil of Carmela, using her husband's fearsome reputation to shake down her neighbor. A tour de force performance by Edie Falco.
