This movie was very well written, and I was highly impressed at the vocals. Phoenix and Witherspoon did excellent jobs at portraying Johnny Cash and June Carter. At first, I almost had a hard time realizing that the vocals were all original. Once I realized it, I was awestruck. Whoever knew that these talented actors could sing classic country like that? I give this movie a 10 out of 10, and highly recommend it to all Johnny Cash fans. It is really something! I also enjoyed the story--of his life...which I honestly never knew all that much about. It gives me an even greater appreciation of Cash's legacy than I already had. Everyone in the film did a fabulous job, and it was very well directed. Kudos to everyone all around.
