I was hugely disappointed with Silent Hill. I know it's a game/film cross over, but to be honest it feels like it when sitting in the cinema (my local cinema showed a repeat showing last night). In fact I couldn't shake off the fact this originated from a game and it was almost like there wasn't a projector man in the cinema but someone who was sitting with his feet up with a control pad playing a game for our amusement. The characters to me, lacked any depth and I felt sorry for none of them despite the horrendous things that happen. I am also surprised that Sean Bean signed up for this film that lacked any character depth or a story that grabbed the audience. In it's defence the sets and effects are good and are very convincing. Sometimes too convincing! Overall this film didn't appeal to me, but I can understand why people who did like it, did. But the best thing you can do is judge for yourself. What is one man's meat is another mans poison. Enjoy the film and make your own mind up. I, for one, won't be watching it again!
