If you didn't like this movie, then you didn't get it or you don't care. Don't ruin it with bad comments for someone it may help in the future just because of your personal belief (which you are entitled to just as well as we are). Every movie is a clencher and gets better, it makes it difficult to wait for the next one to come out. Unfortunately there is not a lot of money in the mainstream for Christian films. I don't necessarily take every bit of these movies as literal fact, but it at least gives a good idea of a possible future and what could happen if........If you haven't seen this movie, give it a try. Then watch the others like # 4, Judgement with Mr. T. There is also the Left Behind series which follows the same basic storyline but with a bigger budget (and the movies are as good as the books!).
