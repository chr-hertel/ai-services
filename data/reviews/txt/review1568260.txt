Superb story, very moving and the emotional scenes were acted by all with feeling and sincerity. The magnificent views over the Lake District were tear-inducing, how lucky we Brits are to have such a feast of nature for our senses ! However, the otherwise very versatile and gifted Renee Zellweger was hopelessly miscast in this role - the lead should have gone to Emily Watson. Renee's English accent is superb, however her delivery is too 'crisp' and 'pert' rather as she played Bridget Jones and she seemed incongruous in the whole Edwardian family set-up....it was unimaginable that she was the daughter of her parents.
