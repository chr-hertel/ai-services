Fantastic Four was a fantastic disaster. I will admit, it was quite entertaining with all the special effects, but it still lacks acting abilities. Neither characters were convincing in their roles, especially Jessica Alba as the Invisible Woman.

I also have to say the movie felt too cartoonish where I understand they're trying to target children and family (that's where the PG comes in), but at least, it could have picked up a little more.

I seriously wouldn't recommend anyone to see it at the theaters, that is unless you have kids, but wait for DVD, or even better, wait for cable.
