It is evident that Golam Rabbany Biplob is a devoted follower of the wonderful cinema of Satyajit Ray. This simple and beautifully told story of a family's attempts to lift themselves from poverty has a lot in common with early Ray films, and particularly 'Pather Panchali. Indeed it contains a shot which is very similar to one of that film's most famous images - when the characters go for a walk and we see them reflected in the surface of a lake.

But there is more. Ray was a master at filming tense family situations in barely lit night-time interiors. Biplob also achieves this in several scenes in this film. The film is one in which the basic qualities of this wonderful art of the cinema are laid before the audience. We see human avarice, lust, deceit, but also compassion and regret presented through well-crafted images, pointed montage and expressive mise en sc√®ne.

This is not a film in which we should expect to find great originality or complex ideas, indeed, we can probably guess the ending within half an hour of the start. But it is the sort of story that, when the art of the film was first created - in the early years of the last century - allowed audiences to experience raw emotions that it had never been exposed to before.

It has been said that all artists are moralists. Unfortunately, in the modern era, in the cinema, this all too often results in the audience being preached at. Biplob eschews such approaches and allows his story space to expand in our minds.

How refreshing. I do so hope that he makes more films of this quality, he is a very promising talent. And his music is absolutely perfect for the story that he is telling. Well done!
