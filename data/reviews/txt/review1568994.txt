Claire (Annabella Sciorra) and her husband (Matt McCoy) hire Peyton Flanders (Rebecca De Mornay) as their new nanny; she settles in quickly and gains the couples trust; and that's when she begins to act out her hidden agenda, becoming the nanny from hell.

Rebecca De Mourney has to take tremendous acclaim for her performance in this movie, she captures the evil intent of her character superbly; selling her persona to the audience with relative ease. Everyone else in the movie performs well enough without ever excelling, although Ernie Hudson (Soloman) does play the simple minded handyman with a nice degree of innocence and frailty.

The tension is sustained well throughout, and the direction is effective without trying to be flashy or over-complex.

This is definitely worth a viewing, it's a very good thriller. 7/10
