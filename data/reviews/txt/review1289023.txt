In "Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid" - a movie whose title is probably more literate than anything contained in the screenplay - an assortment of hunks and babes (i.e. researchers and scientists) head out to the jungles of Borneo to find a rare tropical flower that may hold the key to eternal youth. While there, they encounter massive killer snakes who begin to hunt down and devour the members of the party one by one. So much for eternal youth.

"Anacondas" is a third-rate monster movie that brings little or nothing new to the genre. The snakes generate virtually no suspense since we can always see them coming from a mile away, and their smash-and-grab technique of attacking their victims means the special effects artists don't need to work too hard at making it all believable. The performances are bad, but in all deference to the actors, it's not as if they were given any real material to work with here. The characters are all hopeless stereotypes and the dialogue, except for the occasional expletive, could easily have emanated from one of those clunky drive-in speakers of the 1950's.

Avoid it at all costs.
