NBC, if you bring this one back, I promise to watch it religiously! This show was full of wonderful material... yes, I thought it was similar to Quantum Leap via storyline, but quantum physics lies at the heart of time travel.

I wish that the writers' strike had not interfered with good programming, and I understand that the strike happened for legitimate reasons, but this show (it's actors, and it's viewers) should not suffer as a result of bad timing. Bring it back, please! My parents like it. My aunt and cousin like it. My friends like it. And all the happy people will like it once you begin to air this series again. If you have to, start off with repeats of the first season. See how ratings do now, and then coax the original cast into recording new episodes right away. I know that'll work. Who's with me?
