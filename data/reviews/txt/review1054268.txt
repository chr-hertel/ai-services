STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs 

Rachel (Emily Woof) is a single-mother who awakens in a hospital to be told by Dr Herd (Kevin Whately) the devastating news that her baby has died.However,she experiences flashbacks which tell her all doesn't quite add up,and,with the help of hospital care-taker Daniel (Douglas Henshall) she sets out to uncover the truth.

An interesting,twisting-and-turning story plays at odds with a dry,flat script that creates emotional dis-attachment with the characters.On the performances front,Woof and Henshall just amble along in the lead roles,whilst I just don't really click with Whately as an actor,finding him somewhat off-putting and flat (and what happened to his character at the end,by the way?!??).The star of the show here is easily Clive Russell who carves a genuinely menacing presence as the looming Det Betts.Certainly worth watching if you want to see an intriguing story unfold,but there's very little to keep you lingering around once you've worked it all out.Except maybe a nice Cranberries/Corrs? song at the end.***
