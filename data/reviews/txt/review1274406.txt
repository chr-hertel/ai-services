'The Best From 20,000 Fathoms' was the first monster movie I ever saw-in fact, it may have been the first movie I saw in a theater. It must have been at its initial theatrical release--I was just a kid, maybe 6 or 7 years old. Although I didn't actually see the whole movie at that time, it made such an impression on me that to this day there is some emotional response when I think about it. Pleasant but disconcerting.

My mother dragged me into a theater because she was looking for one of my cousins, who she was supposed to pick up after the previous showing (as I recall those long-ago details). As she was looking for the cousin in the darkened theater while the movie rolled, I was transfixed by what I saw on that big screen. We happened to go into the theatre as the Beast was about to take New York City apart. Since we lived in New York City, there was something very familiar about those streets, and particularly the elevated train. That scene where the Beast comes up through the tracks of the el and trashes the train scared the crap out of me--my eyes must have been as big as saucers since I had been on those trains myself. Shortly after being witness to that scene my mother found & collared my cousin in the dark and she hustled us out of the theater--but not before I was hooked on movies--after maybe 5 or 6 minutes of "The Beast...", though perhaps it didn't seem that would be the case right away.

I literally had nightmares that night & the next night, waking up crying at the horror of it all! It was truly a memorable experience of my young life and, of course, after that I couldn't get ENOUGH of monster movies, and what a time to be living as a movie-going kid--the 1950s and their endless delivery of wonderful and strange monster flicks, each more grotesque and horrible than the last, with most of the humans being more stupid and incompetent than the last. Ha!
