This movie is fantastic! That said, I'll go into the correct diversions I ought to route into.

First, the movie is fantastic. I know I just said that, but let me prove it. It is an artistic movie. How many artistic action movies are there? In my opinion, this rivals "Resevoir Dogs" in terms of good action/dramatic/artistic movies. The juxtaposition of the scenes of action and exposition are played beautifully, and actually make the movie more fun -- for example, as the police try to figure out what happened and decide on a theory, we flashback to what actually happened.

Second, it is acted beautifully. Perhaps with a script as good as this, it's easier, I don't know. My only experience with a script half as good as this is was on stage, and nothing I could have done could have messed up the character of Doc O'Connor (in "The Laramie Project" FYI... and yes, Buscemi played it better...). Billy Connolly (sp?) is amazing. My only other views of him before this came in "Lemony Snicket..." and on a "Daily Show" interview promoting his new comedy act. The brothers played their parts wonderfully, in fact nearly in synchronization. I in fact asked my friend how long she suspected they rehearsed that relationship to get it just right.

Third, the morals. I believe whole-heartedly in the messages of this movie. Yes, not message, messages. To reveal them here would ruin the movie for those of you who have not seen it.

Suffice it to say, this movie is awesome. I hate to sound like a teenage dumbass, but you can't quite gather how good of a movie this is until you see it.

If I had to go negative, the only bad thing I can think of is that it is too short. I'd like to see more about the relationship between Il Duce and the brothers, among other things. But, at the moment, having just finished the movie, I can't think of anything else to go negative about.

YOU SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE!
