This movie is delightful. The main character, played by Keanu Reeves, represents a era when men were still chivalrous, honorable, and ready to lay their lives down to help out a young lady in distress. His character is remarkably refreshing and honest. I enjoyed the fact that while the main characters made mistakes, their desires to do what was right and taking responsibility for the consequences of their actions -- no matter how fearfully -- ultimately won out over the fulfillment of their personal desires and wants. Something that started out as a plan to deceive, ended up unveiling the inner workings of a closely knit family, and a young man's desire to belong to one.
