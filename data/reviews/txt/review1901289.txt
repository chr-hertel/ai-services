It's enigmatic that's I have to say about David Lynch's Blue Velvet.To describe it,seems rather difficult because surrounding a simple looking storyline is quite stunning cinematography,powerful camera work & deep music in which you just want to lost a while... But that wont happen,because you would rather try to question the strangeness of movie.Well,its quite interesting to know what makes Lynch,a director different from others in Hollywood?? Anyone who has followed Lynch's work regularly can answer it and few of those comments are like ambiguous,genius,stupid,strange and so on. Even the critics or movie connoisseur fails to explain the weirdness behind his stories. So its only Mr.lynch,who know what he is presenting in front his audience.May be he wants to bring his nightmare live on screen or he just likes to fool around his viewers,as after dedicating 100-120 minutes they don't get anything.....at least in terms of story!!!

But then those who hates David Lynch's films will be most satisfied by BLUE VELVET,because it is least ambiguous among others.Its much better than Mullholland Dr. and Lost Highway because it don't let its viewer gets diverted in between.....

Story basically deals with two teenagers who in their excitement get involved in the mystery surrounding the night club singer Isabella. Well whatever be the storyline but the matter is presented in a very stunning manner which is quite appreciable.

No wonder its among the best of David Lynch's movie and very nearly a masterpiece.
