It is hard to not like this movie. Jack Black becomes magnetized and erases all the video tapes in his friend's store, causing him and Mos Def to re-make all the movies in "sweded" versions, resulting in many hilarious gags and parodies. The movie balances between raucous comedy and some genuinely heartwarming scenes as a community comes together in an attempt to save an old video store from demolition. The characters are all very like-able and ultimately it can be viewed as a tale that does not need to be taken too seriously to be enjoyed. "Sweding" is described as taking something you love and putting something of yourself in it. This movie is utterly lovable because it was obvious everyone in it loved what they were doing. Be Kind, Rewind is a great little film!
