This is the most pathetic piece of film I have ever seen in my life. I was sold with reading the summary on the back of the movie....and then I started to watch it, and I wanted my $3 dollars back. It made no sense that the main characters kept driving through the desert for days upon days without getting anywhere......honestly you can drive an unbelievable distance in a few days. The fake Jack Black/fat Dave Navarro is sooooo annoying I wanted to throw something at the TV. Wow what can I say about those top notch special effects.....you could really tell they had the budget of about 57 dollars. Don't get me wrong I enjoy bad movies, but this one was frustratingly bad. I loved how Harley was unable to lift the dead body off of him in the car, and the torso in monster man's house. I almost forgot how bad the plot was, having the girl "prepare" Adam during the entire time. All I can say is I want those 90 minutes of my life back.
