I was a little disappointed in this movie. I loved the Matrix, written by the same brothers. If you go to the movies every week, it's worth seeing compared to what's out there. But if like me, you can only slip enough time in for the big ones....wait for the video on this one.

Great fight scenes. Interesting story line. Intriguing supporting characters. Natalie Portman's character is genuine and well portrayed. The only character that left me feeling empty was the main character, the radical, political reformist known only as "V." As much as the writers tried to define him, you're never left with the impression of humanity. Perhaps that was what they were striving for and just missed the fine line between that and a stock character.

However, the Wachowski brothers' clever way with a plot will still entertain you and it is still a worthy rental.
