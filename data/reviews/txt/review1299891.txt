I love all the final films, especially the first.

I could not wait to see it but was very let down. I did not feel you connected at all with cast so when they died, I was not bothered at all. The main character was so bad I thought gosh I hope it's her turn next! 

They gave us more gore but forgot to give us a decent storyline. In fact was there a story line, nope. Sigh :0( 

The first final made you think, the second you wanted them to beat death. The third you wanted them to loose, and quickly ... looks like I didn't like it!
