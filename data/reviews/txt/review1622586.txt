I've seen Seraphim Falls last night and I really like it.Its very underrated and Pierce performance is superb ,I can't believe one day I will see him in a western and he nail the part so perfect.The casting of this film with Brosnan and Neeson (two Irish legend) really blow me away,its the best casting of the year,the photography is another plus point for the film.But sadly not many people embrace this film,the marketing push for the film by the distributor is very poor.The filmmaker made a western that pay homage to classic cowboy film from the 50s and if this film was made during that time it would have been hail as one of the finest western ever.Hope when it get released thru DVD it will get a larger audience.I predict Seraphim Falls will be a cult classic within 10 yrs from now.
