This movie is one of the most comedies i have ever seen. For a low budget film, the acting is incredible and there will not be one part in the movie when you won't be peeing your pants. WIth guest appearances by Jamie Kennedy, Anthony Anderson, Niel Patrick Harris, Finch from American Pie and that dude from Van WIlder..its one of the best movies of all time. There is no possible way to be in a bad mood after watching this movie. The plot is perfect for all the stoners out there, but its amazing for you stone cold sobers as well. The humor does NOT just limit itself to marijuana jokes. There are parts that are genuinely and uniquely funny. Kal Penn and John Cho definitely deliver a breakthrough performance. There are 2 sequels in the making that will only go into effect if the DVD sales go well, so i encourage everyone to go out and buy it. Haa...doogie.
