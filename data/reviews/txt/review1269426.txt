This movie is an excellent example of low-budget horror at it's best.

The movie deals with several themes, people, situation, fear, stress amongst other things.

The actors performances are truly fantastic as well as the concept for the film being a bit mind blowing. It does has a lot of technical things inside the plot which may make your brain hurt but it's a film well worth taking the time to see.

Six (well seven really) people wake up inside a fourteen foot by fourteen foot cube shaped room with no idea of how they got there or why they are there. Travelling through the rooms they encounter much more than they bargain for with 'traps' laying in wait for them.

They must figure out a way to escape the cube before they die. The real question is, is the danger the cube or the people themselves?
