"One Perfect Day" is a musically-oriented drama surrounding the tale of a classical composer who discovers his sister died after taking some drugs in a party. He then decides to pursue the rave scene, and finds himself completely immersing in a new and digital age of music.

...Sounds tight, huh? I thought so myself. This movie does manage to pull some nifty tricks on the unsolicited viewer - but c'mon!! * Crickets do NOT sound anything like a choir when you sample them and pitch them down!! The choir thing is the intro for Orbital's track under the same name as the movie title.

* Some of the dramatic/hallucinogenic elements are just poorly acted and filmed. The raves are shot in a most rough manner that does not capture the energies of a real party (unlike it's fellow mates "Groove" and "GMT").

If you really want to see a Dramatic movie that's also related to and includes a lot of action from the electronica scene, try "GMT" which is a tight movie about an electronic band and their break-ups and hold-ups.
