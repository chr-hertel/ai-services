First off, I should identify that "21 Grams" is not the easiest movie to watch; specifically, it's all about grief. Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro play some people whose lives get intertwined following a car wreck.

A previous reviewer said that the movie's non-linear structure makes it somewhat confusing. I guess that it does a little bit, but that misses the overall point of the movie. The movie is showing the gut-wrenching existences that these people live. As it is, Penn's role here pretty much mirrors his role in "Mystic River".

All in all, it's a well done movie. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu gets down and dirty the same way that he did in "Amores Perros". I do recommend the movie, but I should warn you: don't expect anything light and fluffy.
