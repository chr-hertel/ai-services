The BBC were absolute idiots with their messing with the scheduling of this excellent program - I was absolutely infuriated by it, not least because it was originally moved and replaced with repeats of Only Fools and bloody Horses. This was during the tenure of Lorraine Heggessey, who's other dubious decisions included recruiting Graham Norton to the BBC.

The good news is that the CDs of the Radio 4 broadcasts make great listening and perhaps even benefit from better comic timing than the TV series managed. The radio series retains the same cast as the television production.

I also seriously recommend Andy Hamilton's other Radio 4 series, Old Harry's Game, also available on CD and well worth owning. The man is a comic genius.
