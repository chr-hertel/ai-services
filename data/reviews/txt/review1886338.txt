First of all, i like Zach "John Dorian" Braff. Second, I'm not sure if I like "Zach "The director" Braff or Zach "The writer" Braff. For me it seems, that in "Garden State" Braff puts together the typical ingredients for a, lets call it 'Generation Movie' but doesn't manage to create something really new. Well we have contemporary alternative music (any similarity to the Scrubs ST is purely coincidential..), depressed youngsters, a complicated love story, some surrealistic elements and wonderful photography. But where is the relevance? what is the guys problem that's so different from "graduate" or "reality bites"? if you just show an unoriented young man without establishing a repressive social surrounding it's quite a cheap trick to become philosophical about his reasons. As easy maybe as you can cover an uninspired story by a guy who's walking through a couple of strange environments without changing his facial expression. Anyway, watch the movie, enjoy it and if you don't think about it, you don't have to ask "So, what?"
