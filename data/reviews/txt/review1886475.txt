OK, so this could be a good film. We have a nice plot, a romantic couple with a beautiful girl... Yes, we all know this story already, but still it could be enjoyable.

Poor girl dreams of being a famous singer, works as a waitress as a side job. Poor guy, dreaming of being a famous painter, meets waitress and fall in love. And the story goes on as we all expected, but that is definitely not the problem!

The problem is that the acting is so poor that we get the impression along the entire film that we are watching the result of a high-school film project. The audio is also so bad, it made me remember films from the 70's.

I've seen a lot of low-budget films, but this is no excuse for this film to turn out so lame.
