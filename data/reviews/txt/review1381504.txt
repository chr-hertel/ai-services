I loved this movie! This was my second movie of Gael's (after the motorcycle diaries) and I wasn't sure what to expect from him in this, since he played a transvestite. After his perfect portrayal of his character in this movie, he became my favorite actor. Pedro Almodovar directed this movie brilliantly, making all three story lines intersect in a way that was both suspenseful and relatively clear for a viewer to understand. This movie is funny, frightening, and poignant throughout, and is a great story(ies, actually, since there are three). Anybody who is into drama, film noir, GAEL!!, Almodovar, or looking for a better movie from Darkness' (ugh) Fele Martinez should watch this!!
