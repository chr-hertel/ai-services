We often wax on and on about films -- usually justified in doing so, and can enjoy comparing our analyses with others, debating with those who loved a film we hated, or vice versa, etc., etc.

But sometimes I just enjoy letting friends know about films I'd recommend to them which are funny or amusing or clever or just plain enjoyable.

So in commenting on this picture, I would only say it's all of these.

The story is fun, the performances outstanding, and the chemistry among the three leads is tremendous - both as a unit and in any of the three possible combinations of two of them together.

All three provide outstanding performances, as well as the entire supporting cast. And if you regard this performance by Billy Bob Thornton, compared with his in "Bad Santa" and "Sling Blade" - and think for a moment of these three diverse characters - can there be any doubt that this man is as fine an actor as one is likely to encounter?
