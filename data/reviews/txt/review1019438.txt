The visuals and soundtrack of this movie had a mesmerizing effect on me. It is as close as any historic or period film comes to transporting the viewer to another time and place. The conditions under which Herzog, along with actor Kinski, made this movie must have been demanding beyond belief. The movie has a documentary feel to it; like a time machine has transported a film crew to the time and setting of a Spanish expedition in the Amazon region of South America. I consider this one of the best, if not THE best, movie of all time. There were a lot of things in this movie, like the scene of a boat stranded in the rapids, that could not have been staged or anticipated and which could have ended in tragedy. Some divine presence must surely have been watching over cast and crew not to mention the involvement of sheer luck.
