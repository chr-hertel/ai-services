This little film drew me in with it's central characters, a Mother who was a war survivor,who had been in the P.O.W. camps in Sarajevo (played to perfection by Mirjana Karanovic), and her daily struggle to keep her head above water, with a thankless job in a cocktail bar, and with the daily battle with her adolescent daughter, Sara (played by Luna Mijovic). The two women share a love/hate relationship that will easily tear at your heart at times. This is not always an easy film to watch, but is an easy film to appreciate. First time writer/director Jasmila Zbanic works well with the cast,drawing just enough emotion to make this a heartbreaking, but satisfying experience.
