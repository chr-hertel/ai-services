I saw "Magic" when it was theatrically released in 1978,and I thought "average stuff" .I saw it today and I thought: "I was wrong;this is well above average" .The fantasy and horror movie was a dominant genre in the seventies and Attenborough's sober style passed for lifelessness and his movie met mixed critical and commercial reception.

It has worn remarkably well,and the many reviews it has received on the site show that the movie was underrated .Not that the subject was new: some may remember "dead of night" (1945)and its tremendous segment about the ventriloquist (Michael Redgrave) and his dummy ,the highlight of an extraordinary film made of sketches.

"Corky" is not a cardboard character:he has a background;his life has been a tragic one;as he says himself :"all I have is houses near decay and graves " ;he is a washout professionally and a sexually repressed man.He could never make his the girl he loved when he was in high school.She had to content herself with a crude less-than-handsome "Duke" .

Anthony Hopkins' performance compares favorably with those of "Hannibal" and the Ivory works.From the very start ,we feel how irrational how disturbed this man is.All he does not dare to say,his dummy does ;it's some kind of doppelganger ,like in Poe's "William Wilson" (which Louis Malle filmed in "Histoires Extraordinaires" (1968)).In a lesser degree ,Peg shows ambivalence too: staying with Duke and living on a bourgeois quiet life or following Corky into the unknown,the magic and childhood memories.When she makes up her mind,it will be too late.

The movie is full of suspenseful moments: the scene of the cards,the "five minute test ", Duke's fishing rod and the omnipresence of the dummy,"watching " through the window as Corky is taking a dead body to the lake,or jealous "peeping tom" when his "master" and Peg make love.Humor is present too :" that's what you call: to kill two birds with one stone" .

There is a lot of things to say about "Magic" :towards the end,Hopkins and the dummy are wearing the same clothes ,and the last lines are almost the same as Edgar Poe's "William Wilson" ("Us,it's you")
