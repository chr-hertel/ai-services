I watched "Wicker Park" for the first time in September 2005,and I was truly overwhelmed. Since then, I have watched it over 5 times. I think the best thing that happens to this movie is the ending.

After the whole searching process and all the intrigues of Alex's, Matthew finally got a call from Lisa, who then asked him meet her at the park. Matthew didn't make it and he went straight to the airport to catch her.

The situation in the airport was a chaos, but Matt still found her. As he walked towards Lisa, everything was silent and "the Scientist" of Coldplay started to play.

Matthew knelt down behind Lisa, who just got a call from her 'best friend', Alex. She was definitely stunned to hear the truth. Matt was still behind her, with tears in his eyes. Somehow, she finally noticed that there was someone behind her and when she turned, she saw Matt.

Both of them shed their tears, hugged and kissed each other, but no words were spoken, because words just ain't enough to express their feelings. So, the director chose a perfect song for that, "the Scientist". The ending was perfect, except that I think it should take place at the Wicker Park.

Anyway, the movie was greattt....
