What a disgusting thing having to film such boring action ! It is the first movie I see from this director, and I must say I used to enjoy Mark Wahlberg's acting much more in the past... He should have worked on his part through the studying of Indiana Jones' 4 pictures. I couldn't believe what I was witnessing : terrible plot (just watch "Children of the Corn", don't bother seeing its awful ersatz 'The Happening'. Actors are bad, the plot is boring, the action ridiculous, and actually, even the set isn't great. There is such a lack of suspense that one loses interest after two minutes (i.e. 2 out 10). I personally would have liked to see a dubbed version -in french, of course- because then it would have given an excuse for the awfully boring hours I spent at the theatre.
