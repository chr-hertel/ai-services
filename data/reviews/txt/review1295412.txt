Adequate was how my TV listings fairly described this film, featuring Dale Robertson in his Jim Hardie, Wells Fargo special investigator role of the 1950s TV series. Jim is home in Gloribee, and is intent on capturing a black stallion, but his past catches up with him when a man he put into prison is released and seeks vengeance.

Robertson is supported by some well-known male faces, including George Kennedy in an early role, with Rod Cameron impressing the most as the "good bad guy". Other characters, including several female ones, come from the TV series and are a bit superficial in contrast.

Cross-checking by clicking on George Kennedy in the cast list shows that this film was also known as "Assignment in Gloribee".

I was surprised that this film had a marking of 7.8 out of 10; it's OK but not that good.
