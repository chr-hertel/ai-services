This is an exceptional piece of film in several ways; be it from an acting standpoint (Hugo Weaving evokes true emotional subtlety and complexity without the aid of facial expressions--fantastic!), a musical standpoint (1812 Overture), or just good ol' excellent storytelling. However, the most enduring aspect of this film is the thought process it invokes. On it's surface, it seems to be a simple "boo big government!" film. However, you dig a little deeper, and you see that it's a warning piece that, though the source material could not have anticipated it, speaks out quite neatly against things like the Patriot Act; things that rob us of liberty for the sake of security, leaving us deserving neither (paraphrasing Ben Franklin there -- it's an old idea). And then, on yet another level, it is a film about the revolutionary spirit, differing perspectives on "terrorism," etc....essentially, highlighting as many shades of gray as can be found in such an issue. To summarize the summary, if you like your films full of intellectual exposition and aren't too worried about "genrefication," this is right up your alley. If you want nothing but explosions and gun/knife play, stay the ever-loving hell away.
