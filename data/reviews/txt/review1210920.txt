Maybe it is a low quality movie, but I like it!

Maybe it doesn't follow the Anne Rice book, but I like it!

I feel that one misses out on a great thing by NOT watching this movie (if you like Vampires that is) another thing is the soundtrack/score to it. Its wonderful! The violin-score on the beach for example is just absolutely magnificent! The artists on the score did a great job on this film, and so did Aaliyah (R.I.P) she was amazing as the Queen. Stuart is incredibly convincing at the role as Lestat. 

That was All !

hope you can use this for something :)
