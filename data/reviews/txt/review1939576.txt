3 misfit policemen chasing a mad bomber, 4 unemployed, pot smoking rebels with an underhanded plan to make some money, and 1 not so smart medicine man trying to steal the riches from a ghost's urn, cross paths that lead them to an insane asylum, where their 3 objectives keep the story line jumping in many hilarious directions.

The humor is definitely Thai in nature, and the culmination of these three groups crossing paths, has many twists and turns that will keep you rolling, if you can try to understand Thai humor.

The humor is mostly slapstick in nature and brings back many memories of the late greats in American comedy, such as Laurel and Hardy, Buddy Hackett, and the Three Stooges.

While there are some things that could be objectionable to "sensative" viewers, I believe this is a show that any child above 8 will enjoy if they can sit still long enough to try to understand a foreign film.

The three policemen are very popular, and quite funny, Thai comedians who work well together in every film I see them in together, as well as independently. If you like this one, you'll love another two known as Bus Lane (cannot find on IMDb yet), and "See How They Run" (Thai "Koy ter yuem") http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0833486/ 

If you are a thriller fan, keep your eyes on Thailand, as they tell very good ghost stories.
