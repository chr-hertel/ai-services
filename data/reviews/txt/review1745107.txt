What were they thinking? Clive Owen plays mysterious, brothel regular and a hard man with some fresh ideas of using carrots as a highly deadly weapon. Is this the modern take of the constantly lit cigarette dangling out of the corner of the baby boomers generation movie stars? Cringing, rather than crunching, is what you will do while watching this movie. Monica Belluci's beauty is not enough to distract the viewer from the terrible acting and the poorly pronounced Italian swearwords, and boy oh boy, was it hard to take the guy from Sideways seriously in his role of a baddie.

Not only does Owen kills with his carrots, which happen to come out of a plant pot nice and clean  not a good way to teach our children about where vegetables come from and what are they good for but he then kills at least 50 guys... wait for it... while carrying a heavy-metal-loving new born baby!!! The famous scene where Owen has sex with Belluci and kills (simultaneously of course) another eight guys is just beyond ridiculous. While she jumps up and down on him apparently coming to.. well, just coming  he doesn't seem to be enjoying any of this, regardless of his terrible comment at the climax (pun intended) of the scene: " Talking about shooting your load". The only thing he was shooting it seems, was his career in the foot.
