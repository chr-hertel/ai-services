I saw this movie when it first came out and enjoyed it from the opening scene. The sounds are so grounded in country it is had to explain to someone who has never lived in the south. Regardless, this was a production worth the money and found no reason why it did not take off at the box office. Jerry Reed is great, Don Williams is superb and Connie Van Dyke did the best she could do and for me that was enough. Of course I have always liked Richard Hurst especially as the father to Michael J. fox in the Werewolf movies he made. Art Carney, what can you say about this man, always puts his soul into a performance and he surely did that in this one. I have attempted many times to purchase a copy of it and could not locate it so if any one may know where I might buy a DVD of this great movie please let me know.
