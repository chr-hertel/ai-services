While entertaining and interesting in the beginning, this show is now aiming squarely for the nursing home demographic. The first few shows did contain some element of mystery-solving as the central aspect of the show, with Monk's idiosyncrasies providing an occasional chuckle.

However, this shift has changed. The show is now clearly focused on these antics and is written for an audience who will shake their heads and smile at "that crazy monk"... anticipating when he'll next put his hands in front of his face like a mime and do an exaggerated look around the room. It's become a caricature of itself, much like the later Columbo shows, but with even less of a plot.
