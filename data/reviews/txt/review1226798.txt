Four of us women went and saw RENT the day after Thanksgiving. None of us had ever seen the Broadway play. Luckily, my daughter and I saw the cast on "The View" that morning which gave us more of an idea of what the movie would be about. All four of us said we were emotionally worn out when it was over. We cried and laughed and agreed that we would like to see it again. I don't want to give it away but the one scene with Angel and Tom Collins is so emotional and so realistic. We all agreed that we thought Angel was great so great that I did forget he was a man instead of a woman. And the love that Tom shows for him is heart wrenching. Everyone in the movie is great and the music is wonderful and when it was over the audience clapped liked they had never seen a movie like this before. We thought everyone did a great job acting and singing but we like Angel, Tom, Mimi and Joanne the best. We are ages 51, 45, 22 and 20 and we all loved it so its for all ages. My mom wants to see it and a woman I work with had seen it on Broadway twice before and liked the movie version best. However, my daughters boyfriend, my husband and my friends husband all said they were glad we didn't make them go because they wouldn't like it. So I don't know if men will like it as much or if its too emotional for them. However, we recommend it to everyone even our husbands to just give it a chance, you won't be disappointed.
