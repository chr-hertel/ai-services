I was disappointed after watching this film as I was expecting a prequel worthy of Silence of the Lambs movie. I think if it was an independent film it would have gained higher votes, but I guess people were expecting more form it.

This film lacked the "mistrey" factor,which Hannibal sequels were known with. In the original film, Hannibal was a smart person who predicted the unique methods of a criminal mind. The character in this film approached his victims directly. I thought he was going to hunt his victims in a smart sneaky ways, but unfortunately simply they kept running into each other.
