I have not seen the movie yet, but i would like to in accordance with tradition sequels. Yet not having Rachel Weiss was a very bad move indeed. From the reviews i have read about their character son being too old i must agree that it is not balanced enough. Having a son too old in the picture is by far a drop out money gainer. This script was not thought out enough, by the looks of Brendan Frasier he hasn't aged a day really, but seeing the fully grown son throws it off base by a mile, but it would have been more plausible having a pre teen take the role making the scene more believable. To me Stephen sommers did a great job of the first two mummy's it would have been much more of an adventure if he did the third installment. But since another director took the reigns, it seems to me that the films creators were under pressure to get it made as soon as possible, cutting corners to fit the script to the screen. This is bad movie making in full force, and not having RW there was a blow to everyone who made or watched the first two films. With her she gave Evelyn the charisma and bravery and funny hip jokes which made her lovable on the big screen. It was a bad blow to my nieces when they found out that their favorite female hero was not there to help Brendan face more mummy's or evil sorcerers from two thousand years ago. If it could be possible, it would be nice to have Stephen sommers consider making a new film with the original cast, a kind of full throttle movie with more spills and chills and roller coaster rides that we are used to seeing from the legendary sommer team.
