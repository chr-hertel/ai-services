This is a right gem of a short animation. The plasticine characters are marvellously created, and they move so flawlessly, picking up on every sound detail produced by the people, (its incredible!)

The dialogue is just as wonderful: Some of it is scripted, other parts come from real interviews. This makes it all the more funny and fascinating. The characters (gorilla, hippo, tortoise, and a very frustrated Brazilian leopard) are very memorable.

This is a very clever creation, and a lovely reminder of the beauty of stop-motion animation.

Truly deserving of every award it won. Well done to the artists, and especially to Nick Park--a true genius! He will forever remain one of the greatest magicians in the world of animation *****out of 5
