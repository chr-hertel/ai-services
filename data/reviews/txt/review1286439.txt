A rather interesting, very unusual coming-of-age tale, the film explores ideas such as the effect of one's environment on the way which one views life and normality. Keith Carradine and Susan Sarandon are both are ineffectual, working quite weak characters, but young Brook Shields does a great job in the lead role, fleshing out an excellent character. The film is marred by being overly dark at times and far too leisurely paced - the final half an hour in particular drags. It is a good film, though, and the amounts of nudity are neither in bad taste, nor in excess. Although some of the ideas and events may come off as disturbing, Malle is neither condemning nor condoning, but simply presenting. As a result, we get an interesting view on life that might seem normal to the characters in the film, if not for us.
