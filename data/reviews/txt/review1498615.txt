Another dysfunctional family drama. I have no interest in shows like this but I tuned in because the cast seemed interesting and it was right after "Desperate Housewives" (which I love).

Now, this is NOT a great show. The scripts are more than a little predictable--I saw every conflict and resolution coming from a mile away. Also the father dying and leaving the business a mess is really getting tiresome--it seems every episode they go over the same points again and again. And I really thought it was silly when they all got together for a big family portrait because Flockheart's character was upset. Still I'm going to keep watching for the cast. They got a very talented group here--I can honestly say there's not one bad actor in the cast. I was never very impressed by Fields or Getty--but they're great in this. They all have been given pretty one-dimensional roles but manage to create full characters out of them. The scene that REALLY opened my eyes is when Fields tore into her drug addict son--she REALLY put that scene over.

I'm going to keep watching even though the scripts need lots of work. I heard this may not be around much longer--it loses a large portion of the "Desperate" lead-in. Hopefully it will be around for a while. This cast deserves it.
