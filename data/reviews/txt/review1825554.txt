What a crap!!!... I'm so disappointed.. OK,the first film was not very good, everybody agrees, but in some way it had some a sort of dreamy ambiance, that could kept someone a bit connected to the ambient on the books, and, of course, Christian Clavier as Astérix.. I absolutely LOVED the 2nd one.. Now that's comedy, that transported you back to the subtle humour on the books, those were great actors, etc etc... This one was TERRIBLE! Has anyone seen Astérix?? Who was that guy?? How on earth did anyone ever thought he could play astérix!? And did the director's even read the original book? This was a really bad movie... By the time an hour had passed I couldn't listen to Benoît Poelvoorde (Brutus) anymore.. Even though I think he pulled out a decent performance on this, please, shut him up! My head was banging with all that shouting and crappy dialogues... Not funny whatsoever.. And I guess that crappy Astérix talked 3 or 4 times during the whole movie... Maybe I shouldn't complain, because every time he appeared on screen I thought "what tha hell.. a blue eyed astérix with the appearance of teenager badly dressed to carnival??!"

Please... You ruined it all
