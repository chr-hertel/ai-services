I wasn't sure if I should take this show seriously or not. I mean, you have fish walking around in cop uniforms and it's on another planet and is it funny bad or bad funny and is it on purpose or is it really that bad? The fish thing really threw me. I mean, walking, talking cop fish. What is that? It's a joke, right? Or are they serious? That's what I didn't get. Maybe I'm an idiot. Or maybe they're the idiots. I don't know. I was shocked--shocked!--to see 007 director John Glen was at the helm of this thing. I mean, really, after getting booted from Bond this is what he turns to? Walking, talking cop fish in outer space? Granted, that Christopher Columbus film is no classic, but you'd think he'd have gotten better offers than this. I actually only saw one episode and picked it up halfway through, so I really don't know what I'm talking about. Maybe it's an unsung classic. But it sure didn't seem like it.
