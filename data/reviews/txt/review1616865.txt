For me personally, Clint Eastwood's rise as a humanist master film maker/director after decades of disgusting cop and outlaw imagery and cruelty is a very welcome change. I can watch the drama/visceral violence in a war film like this after I recoil in utter despair from most DIRTY HARRY films. His 2007 image as a great film maker is certainly there and I applaud his constant promotion of humanist ideals in LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA and FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS and MILLION DOLLAR BABY... three excellent films that certainly do not shy away from death and its various forms and sub topics, but are not presented as vulgar hatefilled cruelties previously presented as entertainment in 60s70s and 80s Eastwood films. I am pleased that aged 77 he is now to be so well acclaimed. Maybe in time the atrocities of DIRTY HARRY and OUTLAW JOSEY WALES and HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER etc will be completely replaced with the well observed craftsmanship of his films made in this clever new century. As for LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA and it's expert creativity and stance, I would also welcome the opportunity to see the1949 Republic film SANDS OF IWO JIMA, a very successful version of FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS and this film. Personally as good a film as it clearly is, I feel it is too long and part of a series of WW2 films like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN that now needs to be a topic left alone for a long time. These films are re created history and a perfect template for students of the sadness of war to contemplate. These films are not entertaining; but are study topics, noble and worthy and excellent for 20 year olds to learn from.
