Little Lulu drives her scooter into a big department store and literally up the back of the station manager who takes the returns. She knocks on his head. To his credit, the big guy is polite, listens as Lulu explains she'd like the exchange the package, and gives her slip to find anything else. "Just look around until you see what you want," he says.

His courtesy isn't rewarded as Lulu turns out to be a pain-in-the-butt. 

"It's not what I wanted mister," is the phrase repeated over and over and Lulu slowly trashes the place, making an ice-skating rink, flying a kite, etc. The store manager's slow burn finally erupts - literally - and he has to douse his head under the water cooler!

It gets worse as the manager makes a total fool of himself in the store window and Lulu goes on further rampages, like skiing down the escalator handles. Little Lulu acts more like "Dennis The Menace."

This story really tests the limits of the slogan, "The Customer Is Always Right."
