Saw Brokeback Mountain, loved it, saw it again and loved it more.

My favourite review quote is: You either buy into this tale of men in love or you join the ranks of those who've been snickering during the movie's prerelease trailers, and who can be divided into the insecure, the idiots, or the insecure idiots. 

My take: it's not queering the western, it's queering the hyper-masculinity of modern American red neck mores, with their hunting and fishing trips, 10 gallon hats and kinky boots. And at the same time, it is a universal meditation on the impact and ripples of love on our lives and those we're connected to, both wondrous and destructive.
