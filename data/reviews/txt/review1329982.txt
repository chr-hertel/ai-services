Emma Thompson gave and outstanding performance to Miss Dashwood and the supporting cast with Hugh Grant made me appreciate why I liked Jane Austen's movie so well. I also enjoyed the version made it 1981 the T.V miniseries with Irene Richards and Tracey Childs. Both versions were true to the book. I have read all of Jane Austen's works.

I have several Jane Austen's works on DVD. I own Persausion, 3 different versions of Pride and Prejudice, Northanger Abbey. This shows that I truly enjoy and look all her literature. For those people who are Jane Austen's fans check out her books as well as the other movies adapted from them.
