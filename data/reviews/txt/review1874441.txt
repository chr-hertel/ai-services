This is one of the best splatter flicks I have seen in my entire life!! At first I was convinced that this was just one of those cheap German movies that come out.Oh boy was I wrong.

Dead wrong.

I COULD NOT STOP LAUGHING AT THE GORE!!!! This film makes Hostel look like "Sesame Street". Not even Ichi the killer came this close!!!! Mutilations,beheadings,evisceratons,and rape this movie offers in spades!! Not even the women and children are safe as they get their heads crushed and are raped! This is over-the-top sleazy fun that would even make Tarantino vomit his guts out!!! People who criticize this should know: their movies doesn't even come close to the high I experienced when I watched this movie.

Olaf Ittenbach,you deserve a standing ovation.

Bloody well done.
