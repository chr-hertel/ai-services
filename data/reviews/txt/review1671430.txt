An anthology of short films bound by one character is what you'll find in FOUR ROOMS. And all of the shorts are directed by four different directors with decidedly four different styles that overlap one another via Ted the Bellhop (Tim Roth, DARK WATER).

It is Ted's first day on the job and it just so happens to be one of the busiest days of the year for the hotel (New Year's Eve). Relieving the old bellhop who'd worked there for fifty years, Ted is given sage advice that eventually falls apart on him (mostly related to sex, accountability, and keeping one's own council.) The first episode is entitled "The Missing Ingredient." A clutch of witches inhabits a hotel room and they try to stir up incantations to revive a lost sexual sisters. Sammi Davis, Amanda De Cadenet, Valeria Golino, Ione Skye, Lili Taylor, Alicia Witt, and sex-pot Madonna round out the cast here. All of the witches brings a required item to the resurrection ceremony ...except one. She forgot to bring the sperm of a young man to add to their concoction. Enter Ted the Bellhop who finds his manliness much in need. This was the weakest of the four stories, failing to develop the tale or any of its characters, thus making the entire thing fall flat on its cinematic butt (even though there were plenty of nice butts and boobs in it). SEX AND THE CITY director Allison Anders misses his mark.

The next episode is "The Wrong Man." Sigfried (David Proval) and his wife Angela (Jennifer Beals) are having an interesting New Year's Eve playing a rather kinky game of tie-up-the-wife- and-see-what-happens. Ted is brought into their midst and the sparks start to fizzle. Is Sigfried gay? Is Angela psychotic? Funny thanks to David Proval's history as a film bad-guy, this one had potential thanks to director Alexandre Rockwell.

The third installment is "The Misbehavers." A husband and wife played by Antonio Banderas (TAKE THE LEAD) and Tamlyn Tomita plan to spend a romantic evening out but have to take their two misbehaving kids with them. Or do they? Enter Ted the Bellhop again. They hire him to watch over the boy and girl while they're away. Porno channels, a dirty syringe, flames, and a dead hooker all await the husband and wife upon their return. More of a slapschtick homage to The Keystone Cops, this over-the-top episode was directed by SIN CITY director Robert Rodriguez Â— who loves to direct Antonio Banderas (they worked together on El Mariachi and Desperado.) Probably one of the more laugh-out-loud endings of the four.

The final short is "The Man From Hollywood" directed by and starring Quentin Tarantino (KILL BILL). At the end of his shift as well as his wits, Ted is summoned to the penthouse suite where he gets involved with a wager between two very drunk Hollywood types. Norman (Paul Calderon) and Chester Rush (Tarantino) have a bet going that Norman can't light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row without it failing. If Norman succeeds, he'll get Chester's cherry and expensive car. If he doesn't, Norm will lose a finger. But none of his friends in the room want to be responsible for doing hacking it off should Norman lose the bet. Enter Ted again. Offered a large stack of $100 bills if he'll do it, Ted numbly picks up a meat clever and...

But we won't give away the ending.

Seeming more like a pet project than anything of note, this 1995 offering is entertaining but sorely bland. The Jerry Lewis antics of Tim Roth are admirable (Lewis also starred in a film entitled THE BELLBOY, 1960) but the homage to comedy of days gone by felt forced or missing.

There are still laughs to be found but don't expect too many chuckles.
