Yes, transmorphers is garbage, from script to screen...garbage. The story was weak, and the CGI robots were poorly composited and scaled. Pros....There were explosions, fireballs are cool. I also liked how they used real water for the rain, and ddint try to digitally add rain later. It's obvious that the Asylum knew this from the start and that they don't care. 

The Asylum's demographic is you suckers who buy/rent their videos by mistake. And apparently, there's enough of you out there that they can do this and turn a substantial profit. It's sad, funny, and aggravating all at the same time.

shame on you for making those producers millionaires.
