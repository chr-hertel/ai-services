Two hours. Too long for such a simple story. An interesting cast, but maybe not a good cast, because it's such a mixture. All those different accents is odd enough, in a film supposedly set in La France Profonde. So, though I don't think anyone acted badly, the uncomfortable combination of foreigners reminded me of Star Trek.

The film falls between too stools. It's too odd to be realistic, and too realistic to be a fantasy/morality tale. (Having said that, the atmosphere created by the director and designers is often very good.) I was again reminded of lame SF tales by the simplicity of the religious/social aspect of the story. The freethinking outsider disturbing the status quo... and why not throw some gypsies into the mix?! Molina is good in a Molina-esque way, but how much do we really get to know him, never mind the minor characters, such as the hapless Serge.

The ending of the film is generally well done, and I almost changed my score to 8, but I should resist the temptation to be taken in by the naivety of the "message".
