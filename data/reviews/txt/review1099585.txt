I had been looking forward to this film for so very, very long... And what a disappointment!!! First of all, the distance between the book and the film can most easily be measured in light-years. But that might not have been a problem, if made in the "spirit" of the book.. or at least in a comical, fun way..

The original film was great, but the special effects where slightly.. hooky... So I hoped at least that Sephods head was going to be more convincing in the new film. But it was WORSE !!! SHAME ON YOU !!!

Was it assumed that movie-watchers are dumber than those who read the book?? Why the dumbing down of the story?? 

Please make a new film... please!!!
