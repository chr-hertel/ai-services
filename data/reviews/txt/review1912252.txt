A "popcorn-drama" is what comes to mind. This comedic-drama exhibits all the essential theatrical-elements to create a "good story". That being said, it seemed much of the storyline was "forced", meaning, several scenes seemed to happen for-the-sake of exploring that particular "literary element". The result of this is an exhaustive view of each character, making them seem rather one-sided, which isn't necessarily bad, but I prefer deeper, more dynamic characters..

The story itself was well-told, dialogue was entertaining, acting was decent, but I had higher expectations for this one. To sum it up, this movie was, simply, "simple".
