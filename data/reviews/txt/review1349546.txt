Another part of the dead movie that Mr. Romero did that was great just like the other dead movies that he made,he is a movie of death expert.He did great horror movies and this is one of them,this time the zombies are much smarter than us.That black zombie was like their leader,he leaded them to the water and out which may I say was a cool scene.Leaded them not to be distracted,and leaded them to their buffet...the city,I bet the next is City of the dead.This was a great series of successful dead movie that was never lower than two and a half stars where other were lousy.Romero will never stop on making good movies or dead movies and hope no one will stop him.Always comes up

with a new way for it to speared,make the setting different plus plot,and a horrific way from all of his hard work to die.This was an awesome movie of the year 2005 that they allowed,thanks to the famous director that has a creepy mind George A. Romero.
