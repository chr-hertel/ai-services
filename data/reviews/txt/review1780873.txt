This is a great movie and is so for two important reasons.

First this is a science fiction movie that doesn't dumb down the script with simple or mundane scientific knowledge. The dialogue is heavy complex scientific ideas and notions that fly over the average viewers head (A few went by me.). But even with such wordy and intelligent plot the movie never fails to bring you in as a view. It never preaches to you. It never lets you down.

Also this movie is a perfect example of what you can do with a limited budget. I heard this movie didn't cost anything more than 7,000 dollars. To make. Thats incredible and it is a perfect example that what makes a movie good isn't the special effects or huge actors BUT the fundamentals of film making. Acting. Plot. Chemistry. Things like that ultimately make or break a movie.

With all of that said this movie isn't for the impatient or the immature. Not something you would want to watch with anyone younger than 15 years old. Unless they are uncommonly patient.
