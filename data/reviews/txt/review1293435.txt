Was Comin' To New Yawk City As Her-cu-les, Ja? This was Auh-nulled Schwarzenegger during his early days.

Before "The Terminator..." Before "Jingle All The Way..." Before he became the governor of California...

He starred...in very not-well-known films. This movie was one of them. I know "Pumping Iron" was another such example, but this review focuses on "Hercules in New York." I don't want to give out too much detail; I just want y'all to go watch this movie so that you, too, can experience the excitement that are known as...early Auh-Nauld Schwarzenegger movies!
