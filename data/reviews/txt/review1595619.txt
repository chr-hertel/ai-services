While I do cherish and enjoy all three epic parts of Peter Jackson's film adaptation of the Lord of the Rings, I do prefer "The Two Towers" over its prequel and sequel films. It's not as cleverly made as the first one, not as heart-wrenching as the third one, but it is overall the most powerful of the three.

What mostly motivated me to give it a 10/10 was the fact that it is the only one of the three films where I can sit down and watch the entire film without thinking "This could've bit just a little bit shorter". That was the reason why I only gave the other two films 9/10, because they were a little bit too long to keep me fully interested in their three-hour runs. "Two Towers" is also three hours long, but it has the energy and motivation that can keep me interested to watch the entire thing without thinking afterward what scenes were expendable.

"The Two Towers" has the most action of the three films, which is one of the biggest reasons why I can stay entertained without getting the slightest bit of boredom throughout its running time. And the final hour of the film has one of the most epic and well-made battle sequences ever brought to the big screen.

All viewers need to see the Lord of the Rings trilogy in chronological order, but "The Two Towers" is the best of them all. Great performances by Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Christopher Lee, Bernard Hill, and all the others involved in this masterpiece. Good job, Peter Jackson. This is your second-best film.
