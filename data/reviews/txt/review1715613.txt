Its easy to understand why the animated series of Batman was highly respected. It caught the atmosphere of Batman and Bruce Wayne in a perfect way that up until now only Chirstian Bale has been able to do. I first saw this movie a while back ago and managed to get my hands on a DVD copy of it later which I saw yesterday and I am glad to say that the magic of this has still not worn off. We still have our troubled soul Bruce Wayne trying to fight off his demons in a very tragic way which makes one sympathise with him and it has more of a focus on Bruce Wayne rather than Batman which gives the viewer a much more depressing and grim depiction of him. I would urge people to check this out when ever they get a chance but treat this as a small appetiser for The Dark Knight as it kind of acts on an expansion to Batman Begins, my only complaint was that this one was too short ! I don't want to go into the plot either as I felt the shortness of the movie might ruin your experience.
