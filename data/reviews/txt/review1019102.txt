I was at the premiere of this film at Sundance and was amazed at the performances given by the entire cast, but especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Barry Corbet. Gregg Araki directed the film beautifully and handled the subject matter very well. I don't know how a national audience will respond to the film because of the subject matter, but it's such an intelligently done film. I highly recommend this movie.

The entire cast, Gregg Araki, and Scott Haim were all present for the Q & A session afterward. It was interesting to see how much Haim appreciated that Araki stuck as closely to his novel as possible. He also shared an interesting anecdote about an older woman's responses to the book.
