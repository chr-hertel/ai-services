I just don't think some people understand the point of this film. I keep reading reviews on this site, giving average scores, with the review saying things such as 'What was the point of that scene?', or 'What was the significance of the character names?'. You're missing the point. Jindabyne is a film about life, about circumstance, about the choices we make and about relationships. If you start pulling apart every scene of a movie, you end up missing the bigger picture. This film tackles real Australian issues, of 'Indigenous Australia' and 'White Australia's' reaction to the Aboriginal people, of the sometimes unemotional, even (seemingly) uncaring, reactions of men. It isn't really important what a character is called, or if a scene doesn't move everything along. Ray Lawrence's films are more a musing on life and the choices we make, if you're looking for an action-packed blockbuster look elsewhere.
