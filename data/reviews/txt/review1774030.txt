Since EL MASEER (LE DESTIN), Chahine didn't present a powerful movie like this one, a movie add to the Egyptian cinema a respect and meaning lost after a lot of garbage and meaningless ''undeserved called movies'' , sure the movie had its falls but it isn't mean or that much.

Chahine choose to present the brilliant script by Nasser Abdel Rahman in melodrama style(no limits for emotions & events) as the drama style will tie the events and the speed of showing it ,it had to be done this way as u can't present (police brutality,corruption of the eduction system & the fall of the ethics) in a normal drama if u want to give this powerful feelings. 

Every actor in this movie is at his/her top,Khaled Saleh give a magnificent performance in the rule of brutal police officer ''Hatem'' who love his neighbor ''Nour'' -played by Mena Shalaby- a young teacher with an unrequited love with Sheriff  played by Youssef EL Sheriff . 

Khaled Youssef the longtime assistant for Chahine did a great job as the executive director as Chahine give him the helm cause of his health troubles. 

This movie gives a powerful statement about the catastrophic period that the Egyptien society lives through the mean story and a lot of marksfor this reasons this movie deserve that u watch it with a full guarantee that u will watch an important, high level & powerful movie.
