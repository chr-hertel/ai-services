At first I was skeptical about this one. A series featuring classical music students? I went with it simply out of boredom. Boy, was I glad I did.

The characters and humor is excellent. I was laughing out loud in pretty much every episode. The setting is refreshing and you can follow the story without actually knowing anything about music. The story is about a young and unknown musical genius wanting to become a conductor but having given up on his dream until he meets Nodame, an outcast at his conservatory, who completely messes his life and sets him on the right path. It seems cheesy, but the comedy moments are very much hilarious and the story is put together in a very refreshing way.

I'll be honest and go ahead and admit I'd never heard of the sonatas and concerts featured in the series. I think classical music gained one more fan as of today.

In conclusion, a very optimistic anime series and definitely a must-watch.
