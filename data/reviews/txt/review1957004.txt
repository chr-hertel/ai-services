Prior to going to the cinema I asked my brothers about how good the film is. Two responded by saying it was horrid and the other responded by saying it was incredible.

I decided to disregard their views and see the film with an open mind. I loved City of God so I was going to like Blindness. Wrong. I despised it. I rarely use that word, despise, but in this situation it's logical. Whatever metaphor, parable, allegory that is supposed to be showed in the film is done in a lousy style. You can't sympathise with the characters, there's a lack of poetry, and a dearth of laudable acting. It was like watching a b-grade science fiction film made in the 1990s. At the end of the day I had to say that it tried to be something but ended up being nothing, nothing worth experiencing.
