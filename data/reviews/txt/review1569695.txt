Yeah, yeah, yeah..... Thank you for all the good reviews here, that's why I bought this one. I have no idea how somebody on IMDb could like this...., do you people don't love "movies"? It's trash, not good, not good, I repeat: not good! It's boring, not funny, not scary or thrilling or gory. The actors try to do something with the stuff the script and the director is telling them - they had no chance, ever! Just a bad boring story told by an untalented director (Have you seen CREEP??, okay...)he has no talent, is not sophisticated and so on, so: please don't rent or buy this one - it's a waste compared to SHAUN OF THE DEAD for example or HAUTE TENSION, stay away, stay away. It is garbage!
