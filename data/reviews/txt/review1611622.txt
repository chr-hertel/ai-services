I just got back watching Black Snake Moan at The Studio on the Square in Memphis which was pretty cool knowing that its kind of Craig Brewer's Graceland. I think everything he's ever made has played there. Music is great in the movie which is what everyone will talk about, though most people may not mention how authentic the southern feel is to this film. Other movies seem to just insult the south like Cameron Crowe's Elizabethtown, but with Brewer from Memphis there's just a real 'you're there' feel to the whole movie. It does what every great movie should do. It makes you think, forces you to react, and actually has a great message of forgiveness and being judgemental in probably the most unconventional way possible without having a bit of preachiness to it. See this one in theatres.
