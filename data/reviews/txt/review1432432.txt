I just want to say that I have seen the special feature containing the tour and I thought it was awesome!! These dancers are very talented and amazing. If anyone buys the DVD...check out that feature. I know everyone has their own opinion but I loved it. It is Excellent. These dancers can dance like you wouldn't believe.

Also...the other performers are fantastic too. It makes you want to get up and do it (dance like them). If I had the chance.....I would have. I really loved the movie too.

The Johnny and Baby story is so romantic and how he teaches her to dance is fantastic! I love them together. I have watched it many times also.
