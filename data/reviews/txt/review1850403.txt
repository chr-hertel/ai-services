PATERNITY takes SVU into soap opera territory, as the paranoid Stabler wonders if his pregnant wife's baby might be someone else's. They were separated for a time, after all, and both took up with others. Before the episode is over, the wife and Olivia are involved in a horrific car crash (which I could see coming a mile away, in fact as soon as Olivia volunteered to take Mrs. Stabler to her doctor's appointment while Elliot pursues a felon to upstate New York). The rest of the episode is pretty predictable. Not the worst episode, but too personal and chummy and not enough going on otherwise. Also, Olivia, God bless her, is starting to show her age.
