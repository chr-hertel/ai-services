just got in to about ten minutes and thought to myself i have better things to do with my life so took it out the DVD player and put mi3 in and that was so much better. so what happened? well it just didn't seem interesting nothing really happening that hasn't been there in the previous films if later in the film it gets exciting well i will never know just feel i wasted my money on the DVD it had no excitement or action just seemed boring to me bland would be a good word at least the first film got straight in to the action but this no sorry i guess its just to make money in the fact that people who came to watch the others would come back and part with there cash. sorry not for me thanks.
