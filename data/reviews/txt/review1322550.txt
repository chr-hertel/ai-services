From a critical point of view, this is by no means a good film. The actors are bad, the script is bad, the effects are laughable, and many points of the plot are more out of place than a zombie would have been in The Godfather. But I'll be a monkey's uncle if this wasn't a fun movie to watch! Though he might not be the greatest actor, Don Sullivan just oozes with that classic 50's charm that the whole movie has. Gotta love how lightly they took drunk driving back then! The ending was made pretty obvious within the first 10 minutes, but I'll admit they did a good enough job distracting me from it so it was unexpected in the end. Ah, and then the Gilla monster itself...didn't look convincing in the least of course, but the miniature sets did look quite realistic, surprisingly enough. Overall if you're looking for a good movie, look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you're looking for a fun, cheesy b-movie ride through the 50's, this is the perfect vehicle!

7.5/10
