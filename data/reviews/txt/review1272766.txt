Have seen previous comments on this film and really wouldn't want anybody to miss out on a great film just because the only person that has commented appears to have had a sense of humour bypass.

I am quite intrigued by the creative process that went into this film. If it was made with eyes wide open and written, to begin with, as a post-modern comment on the nature of it's subject; as well as it's stars then fantastic. I do wonder though; it reminded me a lot of Adaptation a film about an unfilmable novel which became a film about adapting an unfilmable novel. I think it's possible that everything that was a negative about filming the book became a positive in the new version. The budget, or lack of, for the battle scene; financial pressure to have a big star.

Anyway regardless of any clever post modern devices; the film was hilarious. Brydon and Coogan were class acts throughout and anyone who didn't understand it; well maybe the joke's on you.
