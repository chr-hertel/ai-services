If any film demonstrates that an actor can make or break a movie, this is it. The scriptwriters deliver Cary Grant a poor hand - a plodding, ham-fisted drama which rushes from climax to climax, before abruptly ending without any real resolution or conclusion. However, Mr Grant single-handedly salvages the entire enterprise, aided by a delightful set design - his blockbuster performance successfully draws the viewer away from the plot, to focus on his character alone.

Virtually all the tension delivered in this film is produced by Cary Grant - a cold stare, a few harsh words, a powerful stride. He is a joy to watch, and the manufactured and phony attempts at drama the script shoehorns in only highlight how poor they are in comparison. With a better script, this film could have been a marvel - as it stands, it is an excellent showpiece for Mr Grant's talents, and an object lesson to aspiring actors (and scriptwriters, for that matter) everywhere.
