The line from King Lear probably best describes what should have been a clever script, but instead was "full of sound and fury, signifying nothing". The writers of the screenplay must have felt very hogtied in what they could do to keep this movie legitimate in accord with the two previous episodes and three ensuing episodes that the writers were bound to live by. However, the lack of imagination in tying the stories together was so appalling, that one wonders why the movie was made to begin with. The movie starts out with what looks like some ignorant video game, the director reveling in his chaotic world, but he doesn't bring the audience with him. Most of what follows is uninspired dialogue, only written to cement the movies together, a vain attempt to establish character, and more special effects that no one cares about. However, the biggest flaw is the future Darth Vader, who we know will turn evil, but his trust in an evil creature to keep his word is more than bewildering. It just doesn't get established as believable on a character standpoint. The characters of Obi and Yoda are much better drawn, but the viewer feels he must credit that to the writers of the other movies, since the other characters are so blandly written, and the dialogue is beyond cheesy. The movie actually looks more like an insane video game. So much so, its hard to care about anything that occurs. The viewer must struggle throughout what seems like an endless movie. Obviously made just to cement the portions of the story together, with absolutely no creative talent thrown in. A good example of what kind of tripe is formed when a movie is made up by storyboard artists instead of creative individuals.
