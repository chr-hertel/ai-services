This one of the most evocative films I've ever seen. Martin Scorsese's love of NY truly shines through here. Just thinking about the film, which I last saw about 10 years ago, gives me a feeling of longing in the pit of my stomach. I've never lived in NYC, but I often thought of moving there in my younger days, and this film really captures the reason why.

Griffin Dunne sort of reminds me of myself in those days. He is a typical young guy, out for a night, sampling the city. It's easy to relate to him, and we really feel for him, worry about him, and laugh at and with him. His performance is superb. Ditto Rosanna Arquette in one of her first major film roles. Even though she's not on screen for long, her performance is so memorable that you feel she was in every scene.

Do yourself a big favor and see this one. You'll never forget it.
