Only because I loved Lucy and Henry Fonda could I sit through this movie.

I get that this film was based on a true story but there's nothing really funny about a grossly overcrowded house with way too many kids.

And Lucy pregnant at age 57 in 1968 before invitro? Give us a break.

Henry Fonda was always one of my favorites but the character he portrays here is not too admirable. He forms a gigantic combined family, gets the wife pregnant and then takes off to the sea leaving the mother to deal with 18 kids and one more on the way.

What a concept.

The remake of this movie with Dennis Quaid and Renee Russo is even worse. At least Lucy and Fonda were believable as a couple - though not as the parents of this brood.
