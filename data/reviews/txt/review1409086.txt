Contrary to what others have said, this movie is very well made, well scripted and well put together.

It is a very sweet good looking teen angst drama that shows Swedens rising star Alexandra Dahlstrom at her best. She plays a 19 year old girl who is trying in a way to find her self and she has a tendency to embrace all the fads of the day. It shows a deep look into the pshyche of a young girl growing up. She has issues with her lifestyle, her family, the men in her life yet she still manages (some how) to keep it all together.

I recommend this movie to anyone interested in the genre. Don't believe what "others" have read... it is a quality film!

Highly recommended!
