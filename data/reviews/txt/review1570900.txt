I saw Pan's Labyrinth last night in NY and it was not just visually stunning, but really heart- wrenchingly honest. It took a hard look at how even in present times the seemingly fantastic fairy tale can still be couched in reality.

Amazing performances as well as amazing scenes. I can't shake some of the horrific scenes out of my head. Captain Vidal is quite possibly the worst screen villain in recent memory, in contention with Ralph Fiennes' Goethe from Schindler's List. 

It's so scary, sad, funny, and creative. Best use of CGI I have scene in film. Not overdone, it meshes with Del Toro's camera tricks and lighting creating an environment that at once seems both frightening and inviting.

A definite must see for anybody who loves fairy tales and even for those who think they don't.

I went into this movie having very low expectations, I mean, it's in Spanish, I was basically expecting a Spanish Harry Potter, but instead I got a Spanish Sin City mixed with Alice in Wonderland and Schindler's List.

AMAZING!
