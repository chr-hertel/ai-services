There are films that inspire and there are miserable attempts of folly. Alvin and the Chipmunks falls into the latter category. Here was an 80's series that had it all: snappy beatz; great humour and fantastic stories. Take that perfect vision and translate it into a full-length feature film and your idea would look a little different than the gruel Tim Hill came up with. Perhaps he never saw the series? We have Dave, a lonely, bungling artist in a world that's hard on soft bachelors. One day he happens to meet a group of talking Chipmunks. It's that simple. These are no ordinary little animated characters however  they sing and they talk. So our intrepid musician writes their songs and gives them shelter. The Chipmunks are a huge hit  America loves them. But can Dave protect them from being exploited by ruthless, greedy men? I advise kids  and only very young kids  to see this with their parents. This is not a film worthy of being considered for adult or post-kindergarten entertainment.
