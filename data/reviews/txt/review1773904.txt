I have never watched on TV today that doesn't just contain garbage and controversy which is nothing but a way to take a shot at something the writers don't like about our country. If you have ever lived in a small town environment where these types of lives are actually happening right in front of you, you might understand. Or,if you have ever played for a football team like in the show you might understand, but otherwise you can see what a man who tries to lead his family/team or whoever in a very professional yet passionate manner can do for a community. This is an absolutely great show,you can complain about acting, filming techniques or whatever, but this show portrays exactly what it is talking about perfectly and proves the point that the writers were trying to make.
