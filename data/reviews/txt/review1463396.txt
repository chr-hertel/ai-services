Chucky is resurrected after being chopped up in the last film. Except this time he is brought back to life by his girlfriend Tiffany, who has been searching for him ever since he put his soul into the infamous Good Guy doll. Now with Tiffany cut down to size, the demonic duo hits the road and hooks up with an unsuspecting couple, in hopes to transfer their souls into human bodies, leaving behind murder and mayhem. In 1988 "Child's Play" was released into theaters and was met with instant success upon its release. The movie had spawned two sequels Child's Play 2 & 3, which were not as successful. So with the franchise down and out, in 1998 "Bride of Chucky" was released. Unlike the previous films, this entry decided to take a more humorous turn, which was for the better. The film gave a fresh new start for the franchise, the fans, and for Chucky himself! This film has a lot of dark humor, some gory death scenes, brief doll nudity (that's right, you heard me), and a very surprising ending. "Bride of Chucky" is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a while. I highly recommend it!
