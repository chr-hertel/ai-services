First of all, there is something terribly wrong with this movie right off the bat. This story has been done so many times! The film also suffers from poor acting. The only really good performance is given by Denzel Washington, but the rest of the cast is unfortunately disappointing. Whoever told Eva Mendes she can act? She is one of the worst new film actresses to come along since Jorja Fox from TV's C.S.I. I really thought this film could have been made a little better if it had a better director, a better cast and a tiny bit more creative story. The film doesn't suffer completely, due to some comedic moments brought in by the best friend of Denzel Washington, a medical examiner Dr. Cabbot (played by John Billingsley). So overall, the film would be a good television movie, but not a movie movie. There are some entertaining parts, if you can get past the clich√© behind it. I hope Denzel Washington picks a better movie to star in next time. Grade: C+ (retrieved from yahoo.com; written 10/13/03)
