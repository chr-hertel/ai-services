I've seen it probably about a dozen times, and I still get goose bumps when I watch certain scenes, like when the young ballplayer introduces himself as Archie Graham.

There are some characters that I'm not wild about Kevin Costner, but he pulls this off really well. Ray Liotta also does a great job, although I wouldn't recommend seeing this right after seeing "Something Wild", as Liotta does a fantastic job in that movie playing a vicious, ruthless guy. Burt Lancaster is great as well, as Doctor Graham. James Earl Jones is excellent, as always.

This movies is a must see for anyone whoever played catch with their father!
