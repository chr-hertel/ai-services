the movie was very entertaining and moving and i like the songs in it some parts were sad like when that kid died and when the twins couldn't come back 2 school and some parts were a bit confessing and i liked the first part of the movie when it was black then it went into col-our that was pretty good and it just made me happy in all the other parts and I'm very Glad i got 2 watch i, and if i got the chance i'll watch it again. the start was pretty funny when she first came into the class room, I'm glad she came back 2 teach the kids 2, because they really needed some one who wouldn't give up on them and she was the perfect person for the job and when she was trying 2 get there attiontion that was pretty funny 2.
