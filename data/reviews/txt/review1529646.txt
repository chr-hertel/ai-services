I still can't see why it have such a great rating here, it's the worst Bond movie, it's like they put James Bond in Miami Vice, no dialog, long and boring, no action, nothing. It's nothing about James Bond, and where are the hot bond girls? who knows?

I see that a lot of people thinks that it's a great movie, but why? even if I repeat, it's too LONG AND BORING AND IT HAVE NO ACTION, it's like someone wrote in the reviews, watching the World Championship Poker on ESPN, again too long and too boring.

Where is the old James Bond? Why is this movie related to the James Bond series?
