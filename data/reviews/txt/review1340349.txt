Stanislaw Lem died a few weeks ago, and upon reading the NY Times obit I realized I had never read anything he wrote. Three books were especially recommended, so I got them all. I am sorry to report that I could not make it through "His Master's Voice," but I thought "Solaris" was inspired. After reading the book, I got the movie and watched it last night. I was more than an hour into the movie when my wife came downstairs. I ranted for a while about how disappointed I was with it, and about how little it seemed to have in common with the brilliant book. She said "So then how come you are still watching it?" Good question. I turned it off and went to bed.

I guess what it comes down to is that if this movie had been called anything other than "Solaris," I probably wouldn't have minded, but "Solaris" the book and "Solaris" the movie do not overlap.
