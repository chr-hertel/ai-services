The best scene was the pop-locking interludes. You may ask what did they have to do with the movie? Absolutely nothing......Certain mini scenes/characters were hilarious (in a hung over sort of way) but overall the film just didn't have the punch. I wasn't expecting 'Friday' or anything like that but this was more along the lines of 'Homeboys From Outer Space' at best. Marv is sort of funny as a stand up comedian, but it seemed as if he depended too much on that talent in this movie, the acting was horrible, the lighting inside the restaurant was very dim (camcorderesque, I'm surprised I finished the movie...but I quickly unloaded the DVD on someone else.
