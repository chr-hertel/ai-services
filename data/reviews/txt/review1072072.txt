Slipstream is a very smart film that benefits from likable characters and an insightful screenplay. So the plot is about a geek played by Sean Austin and slightly gun crazy bank robber Vinny Jones. The two of them make a brilliant double act, one is testing the machine in the bank with a girl he fancies and the other is plotting to rob it. Vinny gets hold of the time machine but doesn't know what he as but when he does it is too late in one scene as he can't save the one he loves as time is not on his side. One of the things I really liked about this film was the musical score by Rob Lord he really captured the moments just right which help set the tone as this film is fast and not just because of the ten minute window but because - as in all action movies - there is a sense of a roller-coaster ride to which the action is based around.
