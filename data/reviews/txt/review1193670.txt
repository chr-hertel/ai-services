Edward Burns has done it again. This movie is so intricate in the plot you realize something new every time you watch it. Everything that is done is almost like a mirage of something else, it all means what it says and yet volumes more! The acting is mediocre, I do have to say that I've seen much better performances from all actors involved. But look past the acting, get into the story, the passion, the love between brother, the good and the evil of all situations. The photography in this movie is amazing. The usage of wide angle shots adds so much to the mood of this movie. Spend one time while watching this movie just to notice the complexity of the simple shots. And while your paying attention to the picture, absorb yourself in the music. You will be amazed!
