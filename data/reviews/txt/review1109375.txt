This easily was the best Batman movies in recent memory. Only because Jack Nicholson was such a great Joker was the first one slightly better. Being a fan of the comics for years, this Batman movie adopted the same dark but enlightening story. In every other Batman movie James Gordan was made to be a boob, but in this movie it showed the special bond that Gordan and Batman both share. I really can't think of any one thing that I would change, which is pretty remarkable. Thanks to the director and the producers for making a Batman movie that sticks to the story line! Even though Katie Holmes character isn't in the comics, at least that I know of, she was great as the Assistant District Attorney. Hopefully we will see Harvey Dent her supervisor in the next movie! This most definitely is a PG-13 movie and should not be viewed by children younger then 10 because of the dark storyline and Bruce Wayne's nightmares. This most definitely gives hope to the upcoming Superman movie coming out next Summer! I guess DC is tired of seeing Marvel Comics do all the comic book movies. Could we be seeing Superman vs. Spiderman next year? That could be interesting!
