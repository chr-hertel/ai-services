Previously I had thought that the highpoint of Bobcat Goldthwait's career was going to be Hot to Trot. Boy was I wrong. This is the funniest thing I've seen on TV for as far back as I can remember. I'm still laughing about it while I'm writing this. I was crying and punching my pillow and wishing someone else was watching it with me besides my dog at 4 in the morning. Now I don't want to build it up because then you might be let down. I know how people can say, this was SOOO funny then you go see it and you're like, it wasn't that funny. So...this wasn't that funny. But let's just say it was good enough to make me instantly look it up afterwards and get a membership on IMDb in order to leave a comment about how amazing it was. If anyone ever reads this...My God. This show. I can't believe it.
