As mini series go they do not come much better than this. A brilliant portrayal of what life was like for those unfortunate people who found themselves without work at the beginning of the 1980's. A depressing testament to the power wielded by political leaders and the total indifference shown by those in work to those without it. All young and sceptical people bored by the stories told them by parents who were affected by events portrayed in this series should take a look see. Then they will realise that the stories they have heard are in fact true. A lesson for all which, when once seen, must never be forgotten. Comedy, pathos, bathos you name it, it has it all. Wonderfully acted. Not a poor performance anywhere to be seen. Has great educational value.
