If anything, the aliens in TODAY'S films do a lot better job of flying than these do. When I first saw this in the late Sixties (In Black & White)-- I was wowed and awed. 

NOW-- I keep asking: Are those aliens on Crack or something? Don't they know that drugs and piloting don't mix? 

Take away that AstroLicense!!!
