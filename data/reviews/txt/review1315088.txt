It seems clear that Lifetime was desperate to show itself as "cool and edgy" with this "movie." To do so, they decided to emulate the incompetent film making non-techniques of Thirteen and The Shield.

The result is an unwatchable mishmash that looks so amateurish it makes some of the worst recent Lifetime movies look good in comparison.

I regret to say that the wonderful Tim Matheson lent his good name as the non-director of this masquerade of a movie. Maybe Tim doesn't really want a career in directing as this movie will make producers run in the other direction.

Lifetime owes an apology to its viewers after this disaster.
