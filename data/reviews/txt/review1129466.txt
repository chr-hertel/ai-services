Incredible. Simply the most enthralling movie I've seen in ten years, subtitles and all. An unusually fulfilling love story, an engrossing mystery, and an anti-war movie with battle scenes more numbing than Saving Private Ryan, one whose horrors will be fully appreciated by anyone who has visited the battlefield memorial at Verdun. Wonderfully acted by Audrey Tatou and company, directed with thought and integrity by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, with a glorious cast of real people. I've been waiting for the release on DVD for months, and right there, in the middle of all the overblown, shopworn tripe coming out of Hollywood in popcorn summertime, this delicious flowering of the art of the cinema simply grabbed me and never let go. My faith in cinema is restored, and I now know why the lines at the Paris Cinema in New York were so long. And who knew Jodie Foster spoke perfect French?
