OK, where do I start? I fell in love with Little Britain at the start of series 1. Series 2 and 3 both had flaws but were great also. I went to see them live and was blown away. It was the funniest thing I had seen in a long time.

When my Fianc√©e and I heard about Little Britain USA, we couldn't wait, we watched it, I think I laughed (halfheartedly) about once.

I think that the characters were "Lost in Translation", by which I mean that whilst trying to appeal to both Americans and British people, the characters and jokes had lost all of their comedic value.

Whilst I respect Walliams and Lucas for what they have done for British Comedy. It doesn't quite work in the USA.

P.S. The canned laughter doesn't work at all. The live Studio audience gave the British series an authentic and natural quality
