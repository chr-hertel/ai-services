Historical inaccuracy? Check. Badly misjudged 'modern' youth speak dialogue? Check. Basically the same story every week? Check. The worst baddie in British television history? Check. A total lack of wit, drama, humanity or fun? Check. Dreadful dreary writing full of clich√©? Check. A great English myth defiled and debased for the 21st Century? Check. Makes even Kevin Costner look competent? Yikes but, er, check. Loved the nation over by 7 year olds? Checkity check.

The big difference between this and Dr Who (which occupies the same slot on BBC1) is this: Dr Who is family entertainment, because it doesn't treat the audience like idiots and thus adults can watch too. Anyone over the age of 10 will feel their intelligence is being insulted by this unspeakable dreck. Still, as I say, the kids won't mind, but it's got to go down as a missed opportunity.
