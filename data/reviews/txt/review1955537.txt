what a piece of junk!!... after reading all those reviews that warned me about this horrible movie, I decided to watch a bit for myself. So I have to say that I only wasted 10 minutes of my life... and how I regret it...

don't watch it, is not even worth seeing out of curiosity

It is sad that the director has no sense at all, and on top of that he comes here to say it is the bes movie ever. I think the director should consider getting another career.

do not watch this movie

The director wrote that he reinvented horror genre, yes you did, you invented a whole new category of bad movie making. seriously it was the most stupid movie ever.
