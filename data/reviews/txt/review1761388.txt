this movie is a great for the family. It Has Good Humor, great storyline, It is a fantastic kids movie. So if your looking for a great kids movie watch the hilarious comedy staring jerry Seinfeld Bee Movie. Pros: Graphics, voice-acting, JOkes, Cons: Not Deep in plot, I recommend this movie for any person who wants to see a great family film.
