I could not agree with you more that the raters of the Looney Toons movie just missed the boat, the train, the point, and the punchline! But I think they were looking for more sex, blood, violence, thrill, profanity and nudity. They reflect the times when more people would rather see these things than watch a wholesome family-oriented piece such as this. This movie is rated PG for one reason: Yosemite Sam's mouth. And even there, the worst he says is our old favorite replacement for the F-word, "Fragnabbit." 

So what's wrong with this movie? In a word, it's too family! It's fun for all ages, and cute without being too cutesy. Even Steve Martin plays it to the hilt, and I never was a fan of his character.

So I'm with you 100% that the reviewers who dissed and doused the Looney Toons movie need to get a life and a funny bone transplant... FAST!!

This movie is 92 minutes of side-splitting laughter, and well worth the chest plasters and rib stitches! Most of all, it's a movie the whole family can enjoy without all the politically correct under-rated adult content that makes most of today's PG movies too old for our children. For the young, it's high entertainment that doesn't stoop to too much violence. For the emotionally young, it's worth the stroll down memory lane with our favorite Looney Toons from bygone times. I think every WB character ever created appears in this film at least once, and long enough to be recognized.
