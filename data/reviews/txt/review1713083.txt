In the past film maker Wang Chao has worked as an assistant to famous Chinese director Zhang Yimou.This is why "Orphan of Anyang" has some traces of Yimou's early films.For his debut film Wang Chao has filmed the novel which he wrote.It was easy for him to film this story as he was a part of it in the past and personally knew some of the people whose life he portrayed on screen.From a technical point of view the film is slow and contains many static shots.However this should not bother viewers as the film is very touching and audience will surely sympathize will the main protagonist who has lost his job.Orphan of Anyang presents a new face of China where there is misery,unemployment, gangsters and prostitutes.At Cannes Film Festival 2001 this film was chosen for Directors'fortnight section. It also won the audience prize for the best film at 7th International Film Festival of Kerala 2002.
