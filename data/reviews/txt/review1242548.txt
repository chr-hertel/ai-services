I saw this film in a theatre when it came out and have never forgotten it. It is simple and realistic and presents a situation everyone will identify with. The main character, played by Gassman, lives a contented life with a beautiful wife, friends and a comfortable if boring job as a civil engineer. Then, he happens upon a chance to make a fortune. He has inside information, so it's a sure thing. All he needs to do is raise a good deal of money. First, he borrows from his friends, but doesn't get enough. Then, he borrows from others, getting more and more desperate.

This progression is realistic and believable, so much so that one can feel his panic as this golden opportunity seems to be slipping away. He sinks to lower and lower depths in his borrowing.

I won't tell you how this comes out, but I will tell you it's a powerful film that you will remember as long as you live, as I have.

It's a pity that such a fine film shouldn't be available on VHS or DVD. If you have a chance to see this film, don't miss it. If you know someone in the videotape industry, write to them and urge them to put this film on video. It's a rare film to treasure.
