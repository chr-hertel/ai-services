I found this movie to be quite satisfying. Combining the rich wisdom of the Persia Empire with Norse tradition when most of Europe of ravaged by Barbarian hordes allows for the audience to see the richness of cultures rarely put on screen. Arabians in that era were the keepers of incredible wisdom and this film displays that.

Loosely based on Beowolf, the Norse leader is one of the most intriguing characters I've seen in a long time. Director John McTiernan allows the viewer to see how this man truly is wise and brave.

The ending isn't as good as the rest of the film, but it doesn't destroy the film.
