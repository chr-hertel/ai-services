OK, let's just ignore all the little politically-correct milquetoast losers who are wasting our time obsessing about the "Mel Gibson Racial Controversy" and focus on the movie...thanks. Anyway, I was surprised to find that this film was simply an action-adventure (albeit an amazingly well-produced and beautifully-filmed action-adventure) as opposed to a deep, mystical and revelatory experience with religious overtones. Given the name (Apocalypto) and the featured subjects (the Mayans, who figure so prominently in esoteric thought and New Age mysticism), I expected something completely different. A lot of us seem to be stretching our necks out pretty far to find an underlying theme examining the breakdown and decline of a civilization. Who says that the Mayan civilization only began to engage in human sacrifice as their end began to draw near? I think it is probably more likely that this had been an ongoing part of their spiritual life throughout their history. What shocks and appalls 21st-century audiences could well have been the norm for this culture. Also, I think that most everyone here is greatly overstating the violence and gore factor, I mean, has anyone watched Kill Bill lately...or Reservoir Dogs...or Saving Private Ryan? That being said, I still thoroughly enjoyed this film and it is truly a treasure in this age when the vast majority of our movies are comprised of unnecessary remakes.
