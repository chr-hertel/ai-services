Stanley Kubrick is a great director and Stephen King is a great author! I love all of Kubricks' work especially this one. The Shining is one great movie. The characters' and then makers couldn't have made a better film. When I first saw it I was scared to death. It's one freaky movie with a great story line and action. There was never a dull moment. Surprises' were around every corner in the movie. Kubrick and King provided everything for a awesome movie with a mood that makes you feel scared but yet in some way you fell bad for the people stuck in the hotel. They couldn't have based the movie anywhere else besides where they did or it wouldn't be as good because the surroundings and weather help the story develop. If you even like horror movies, you have got to see this one!
