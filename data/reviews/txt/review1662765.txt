THE APOCALYPSE (theasylum.cc) Starring: Rhett Giles. This film is not the usual cup of herbal tea, My fiend ! Lose the beginning segment, That seems only added for violence as a afterthought. This is a great film,There we said it,It has character& special effects and a story. Most of the time there is a well thought out faith film and then there are amazing effects only seen in some of Hollywood's BEST science fiction.

The basic premise is Â– The world has begun it's end and We should touch base with loved ones and remind them we want to be together in a better place, See we can be subtle. Again this would be a welcome tool to most churches, Sans the dumb five minute little camp-misfire in beginning. So, Think of Left Behind and Armageddon with a dab of original success !
