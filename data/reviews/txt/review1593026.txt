Not all who fight for their country have guns in their hands, some fight with music. Vietnam Symphony is a documentary based on Vietnam war during which the Hanoi school of music was forced to shift to a small village and classes were held underground. People who were students in that time share their experiences while the camera moves between images of color and black and white. One thing that oozes out is the passion of people when they narrate their stories, their pain in suffering, its real, its shocking but at the same time their bravery gives hope and optimism.

A well shot movie with good direction and good narrative. Do watch it if you want to experience how humanity prevails during war time!
