It's odd how you can see a movie twice within, let's say, 5-10 years and totally change opinions of it. When I saw this movie in the theater I really enjoyed it. It was unique and, like a lot of Johnny Depp films, had a bizarre character that was fun to watch. It also was unique to see Marlon Brando in this kind of odd comedy. Both she and Faye Dunaway are very subdued in here. Depp is rarely subdued.

When I saw it again on tape about seven years later, I thought this was so stupid it was an insult. I couldn't believe I liked it the first time. What I was I thinking?

I will say, only Johnny Depp could play a guy who THINKS he's "Don Juan," and convince me he's sincere! He's that wacky, film after film. He is his usual self and keeps this film alive, not Brando or Dunaway who are both very dull. I blame the script for that. Neither of this famous actors was given much to work with in this movie. At least Brando was having fun making the film. That's obvious....and unusual.

By the way, for those who look at ratings, despite the light, fluffy atmosphere of this story, this is yet another PG-13 that should be "R" for all the sexual content. Always beware of the rating PG-13; it's the most misleading rating of them all.
