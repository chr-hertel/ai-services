Five Suspects, one line up, and a puppet master pulling their strings. The Story is told by Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) while being questioned by the police. The Line up is no coincidence, and the usual suspects are all suspicious, and we, the viewers are deeply confused.

The Cast is simply brilliant (Kevin Spacey's first Oscar was well deserved) and no-one's performance is weak. The Direction by Bryan Singer is quite incredible, this is not an easy film to make work, it really is very complicated and the truth is very well guarded.

Despite your enjoyment, you will feel confused for much of the time, puzzling over the various plot elements as they intertwine and twist you around, but its all down to the clever direction, there are not many movies out there, like this one. The good news is this - the ending is totally satisfying, and that alone is a rare thing to witness.

Despite the complexity, this film works, but if you don't give it your full attention, it may just pass you by. And that would be criminal! 9/10
