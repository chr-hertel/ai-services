I sincerely doubt that Mary Shelley would have appreciated this sensationally weird interpretation of her classic story but, unless you're the reincarnation of her spirit, you're guaranteed to enjoy this "Flesh for Frankenstein" a hell of a lot! Released right before the also highly recommended "Bloof for Dracula", but this sick puppy is even more deranged...more outrageous...and more amusing! Paul Morrissey's cult movie is a nearly perfect amalgamation of artsy, typically European exploitation (decorative sets, twisted characters...) and nasty American drive-in cinema (endless amounts of soft core sex and enough gory entrails to pave the roads between Casablanca and Cape Town...). Cult icon Udo Kier is simply superb as the unhinged Baron Frankenstein who wants to create both a male and female monster, so that they can copulate and bring forward a totally new breed of living creatures. Unfortunately (for the Baron, at least) he opts for the wrong male brain donor  the town's real stud is sharing the bed with his wife, the Baroness  and the monster doesn't show any interest for his ravishing 'bride'. The pitch black humor really works and  believe it or not  the original Frankenstein tale is never ridiculed. I do wish Morrissey would at least had attempted to bring some tension, but what the hell... Just the gore will do in this case, I reckon. Some of the gore highlights include an incredibly nasty decapitation, the optimizing of the female monster and  oh yeah  the unequaled finale which colors the TV-screen blood red! "Flesh for Frankenstein" surely isn't for all tastes (it's actually one of those "love-it-or-hate-it" films) but if you dig 70's trash/exploitation cinema, this is a must!
