This is by far the best movie of all time. It has it all...action, a love story (without being a chick-flick), comradary, humor...everything. Not only is it the most quotable movie of all time (i.e. "Negative Ghostrider, the pattern is full" "I feel the need, the need for speed" and "There's no points for second place" to name a few) but it also has one of the greatest soundtracks of all time. You'll be hard pressed to find any boy born after 1978 who didn't, at some point in his childhood, pretend to be Maverick, Goose, Iceman, Slider, Hollywood, Wolfman, Viper or Jester. If you haven't seen this, you're definitely not American, and if you HAVE seen this but didn't like it, you're probably a Communist.
