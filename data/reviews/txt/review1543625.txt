Well, the movie is intentionally bad done. Very campy. Anyways, this movie is so bad that... it's fairly good. Adam West seems to haven't got rusty, and the other lads and lasses, even they don't act bad, they don't do it OK, but their acting gives it the campy feeling. The badly done monsters (done like those from the 50's, at least of low standards for these special effects ridden movies), bad special effects, cheesy storyline, and "terrible" acting makes the movie what it is, and so, it's funny. This is one of the few TV movies that despite the appearance, it's funny. Take the worst movie you have ever seen, multiply it by 10, then divide it by a very funny but fairly lame movie, and you have this movie. Seriously, this movie is good rubbish. Really good rubbish.
