Batman:Begins is the prequel to the blockbuster smash hit Batman. The last Batman movie was Batman and Robin. I thought that was a pretty well done movie. It starred George Clooney in the role of Batman. See thats the thing I like about Batman. There were 4 different people playing him in a different film. If someone else played Peter Parker in Spider Man 3, I probably wouldve never watched it. The four Batman actors were Michael Keaten,Val Kilmer, George Clooney and Christian Bale. Its like you cant tell the difference and you can't notice the character. Batman Begins explains everything in the first hour. How Bruce became what he is: Batman. I liked the way everything was explained. But everyone is talking about Katie Holmes and her love life more than the star of this movie and the movie itself. She doesn't have a big role and doesn't have a small role, but it was alright. The ending has all the action. With the big chase scenes. I thought Batman: Beigns was a pretty decent film. But it doesn't add up to last year's Spider Man 2, but it adds up to be one of the biggest movie of the summer.
