This is a vastly underrated movie. This is a fun, action-packed movie that should be watched with friends. It has elements of a Western, with a shoot-'em-up feel. It has elements of a war movie, with exciting dogfight scenes. It has a new twist on the car chase scenes from crime movies. The main theme is the classic "government gone wrong", with our heroes battling both the government and the evil Reavers to enlighten the citizens. There is a romantic plot line underneath it all, along with some dissent among the crew. But in the end, everyone shows they are ready to give their lives in order to do what their captain feels is right.
