This is a fine animated Disney flick: in the same era as The Aritocats and The Jungle Book (both of which also have Phil Harris voicing a key character) and of similar quality.

The quality of the animation is average for the era; but the storyline is above average: lots of good humor, based on the timeless story.

But I want to draw attention to the Roger Miller songs: "oo-de-lally" and "not in Nottingham": both are fantastic tunes, but never seem to have gained the same fame as famous tunes from other animated movies. Roger Miller, of course, is most famous for his mega-hit "King of the Road".
