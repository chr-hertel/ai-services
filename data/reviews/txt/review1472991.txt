I attended the World Premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival.

Incredibly shot, marvelous acting and a story that will make you think strongly not only about the situation then but of the situation in our current day world. Costa-Gavras' script (co-written with Jean-Claude Grumberg) is tight and stimulating.

I really hope to see this movie in theatres soon for every one to enjoy.

Terrific final cameo with Aznavour!

Congratulations guys.
