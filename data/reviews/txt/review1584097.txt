SMOKIN' ACES doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. It has elements of an action picture, but it also tries to be a murder mystery, comedy, and drama. And on all levels... it fails.

The biggest problem is the ending. The filmmakers set the stage for what could have been one heck of a shoot-out. Instead, it settles for a "twist" ending that REALLY disappoints. Many characters sub-plots are left unresolved. It's one thing to have a consistently bad movie, but having a movie that could have been great and blowing the ending is even worse. I couldn't believe Joe Carnahan (NARC) directed this picture. Save your money and don't even rent this one.
