Returning to this classic 1952 version of Wilde's remarkable comedy of manners, and after viewing the new version with Dame Judy Dench, I was struck by how superior it is in every way to the newer version. Simply in terms of acting style alone, it cannot be faulted. According to the writer Sheridan Morley, Edith Evans' famous interpretation of Lady Bracknell was apparently developed in memory the many grand ladies that had kept her mother's family in domestic service for many years. One can well believe it. And director Anthony Asquith has not made the fatal error committed in many recent film versions of Wilde's plays, of 'inventing' extra material to take away their staginess. Their staginess is part of the way the pieces work. Now, all we need is a proper restoration of the Technicolor original and we'll all be happy.
