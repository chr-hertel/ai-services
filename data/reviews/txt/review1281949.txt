Really, I mean, come on. If an old movie from back in the day doesn't do well, then what makes people think that they can do it better? The only redeeming point is that the sounds are done particularly well. But even that is not enough to uplift this horribly atrocious mockery of a horror movie. The fact that nearly every possible situation was pretty much left open and otherwise unexplained is an amateur move. Cheap scares like the "coat behind the door" technique are shamelessly used. Just terrible.

External point advantage for the hot chick. Oh and the fact that they used an arbitrary excuse to douse her in water while wearing a sufficiently tightened shirt.
