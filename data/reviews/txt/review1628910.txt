You won't see anything new in this movie. If you've seen some thrillers, than you will foresee a few things. Surprisingly enough that doesn't hurt the movie as much as I thought it would. That might be the case, because you've got Morgan Freeman and John Cusack in the movie. They play very good at/off each other. And although, there are a few bumps in the thrill ride, they obtain the high adrenaline level almost every single time.

I had mixed feelings about the ending, but then again some might think it's perfect. Others might not like it at all and it might spoil all the fun they might have had up until that point ...

Anyway, it's a nice little thriller with good acting in it! :o)
