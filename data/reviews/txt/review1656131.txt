This was another very early, perhaps the second, Pink Panther cartoon ever and it featured one main thing the first cartoon had, mainly no backgrounds, just the objects being used highlighted.

So when the Panther suddenly finds a key to a house, the house - or rather, just the door - is the only thing we see. When he enters the house, just the objects like the lamp, the bed or the shower - the objects he uses - are the only ones drawn on the screen. That makes for some pretty wild sight gags, and good ones, too.

We have a homeless, sleepy Pink Panthee who first shuffles into a "flop house" (there is an old term) looking to catch some z's, but he and the "welcome mat" get thrown out immediately. Our hero then finds a key, turns around and - presto! - a door is there, and so he enters and makes himself at home. There are two funny bits, one in the shower and one with an electric tooth brush. 

Soon, the drunken guy who owns the house, comes home and more gags ensue, leading the man to give up the "demon rum."
