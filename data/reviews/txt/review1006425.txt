When my girlfriend rented this movie I thought "hmmm, what excuse should I use this time? I need to get out of here!" As I don't make a habit of renting movies that don't have action, gore, nudity etc, you know, a GUY'S flick! However she put the film on, and I really couldn't be arsed getting out of my chair, and I had a cold beer with me, so how bad could the film be? Not too bad as I found out! It made me laugh and reminisce about how much of a Garfield fan I used to be when I was an 8 year old kid, way back in the 80's. I think I may still have a few of those old books...

But I digress. The film is engaging, funny and heartwarming. Bill Murray does a great job as the voice of Garfield (remember the guy who was the voice of Garfield in the 80's cartoon movies? I always liked that voice), and the human actors do a decent job too. But, it must be hard to play second fiddle to a big fat CGI cat!!
