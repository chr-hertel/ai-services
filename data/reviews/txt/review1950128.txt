More than twenty years after its release "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is something of a cult classic. Simply put, it's the story of one young man's struggle to take it easy.

The title character is played by Matthew Broderick and, for me, that's where the problems start. I'm not a Broderick fan at the best of times and here it's twice as bad since he's playing a character that I find it very difficult to like. I blame John Hughes's script for giving little or no justification of why Ferris is almost universally liked.

Ferris's pal Cameron (Alan Ruck) is a little more engaging but his girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) serves no discernible function other than that of eye-candy. Easily the best effort in the acting department comes from Jeffrey Jones who gives an iconic performance as the dean who's out to get Ferris.

Considering these characters, the story is unsurprisingly slight. The trio basically drive around town in a Ferrari and supposedly live life to its fullest, though in actuality doing little of consequence. Adding just a smidgen of depth to the proceedings is the introduction of a crisis that will force Cameron to decide if he'll finally start standing up to his father.

The direction by John Hughes (who was also the screenwriter) is well handled though not particularly remarkable. The soundtrack is a typical 80's melange, complete with Yello's soon-to-be-clich√© "Oh Yeah". I would say that the production values are solid but they're not going to turn the tide if you can't connect with the characters.

If you have fond memories of this film then I doubt that they'll be dashed by seeing it again but if you didn't see it back in the 80's then I wouldn't really recommend seeing it now.
