I saw the movie here in US last week. The movie is not that great and it's not that bad too.

Hrithik was 'THE' highlight of the movie. His dance, acting everything that included him was awesome. Of course some stunts which were very unnatural but still it's Hrithik.

Seeing Abhishek act and dance after Hrithik's song was very funny. I felt they let Abhishek down in this movie... I mean may be Hrithik outcasted him. Aishwarya is great as always and all others are pretty normal and did what they expected. The movie over all is a timepass to watch.
