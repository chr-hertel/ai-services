A group of college kids goes camping, only to run into a vagrant with a very nasty disease that involves vomiting blood. After killing the bum, and dumping him in the river, things actually get worse: the water supply comes from this very same river.

Writer-Director Eli Roth is like the great American hope when it comes to horror movies. He grew up ingesting 70s and 80s horror (which are undeniably the best decades for horror ever) and is personal friends with director David Lynch and composer Angelo Badalamenti (who made some of the music for this film)... This is the perfect witch's cauldron to brew up the future of horror and save us from the mediocre horse crap that's been coming out the past 15 years.

Cabin Fever is the cure. We have a group of teenagers going to the woods to party, and they end up encountering a monster that's actually believable: a flesh-eating virus. With music that sets the tone, perfect lighting, quality acting and gobs and buckets of blood, gore fans are in for a treat. The clich√© of teenagers drunk in the woods actually makes sense rather than simply being an overdone idea. In an odd turn of events, the alcohol turns out to be their only hope for salvation (but will they find out in time?). 

And a powerful performance by Rider Strong. All the actors were great, and the characters were dead-on. I have seen films where characters aren't developed enough to know them or over-developed (because why should we care if they'll die anyway). I could identify most of the kids in this film with people I've known in real life: Strong as the boy in love with his childhood friend, the guy who will only drink beer... these are real personalities.

Another great thing about this movie is the humor. I found myself laughing out loud a dozen times in the first fifteen minutes. And as the movie gets darker, so does the humor. You have to be truly sick to find some of it funny, but if you're watching horror films you're probably sick enough. Keep an eye on the sign behind the rabid boy when they return to the shop. The reference to "Deliverance" combined with the kung-fu is something you will never forget. And the end of the movie, which I won't reveal here, has one of the strangest "reverse racist" jokes I've ever seen. And the character of Winston, while a bit of an extreme case of caricature, is pretty amusing.

If you're a fan of horror, be sure to watch the making-of documentary. It's only 20 minutes, so you won't get bored as they quickly move from the acting to music to effects. Not too technical, but gives you enough overview to really appreciate the thought that went into every little detail. 

Roger Ebert says, "The movie adds up to a few good ideas and a lot of bad ones, wandering around in search of an organizing principle." I don't agree with Ebert at all, which is sad because I normally would. The film is quite organized and linear, with a central theme and plot. The "few good ideas" permeate the course of the film. Are the "bad ideas" his homages to other films? The use of the theme from "Last House on the Left" was brilliant and subtle.

As I said in the intro, Eli Roth is the man you want making your horror films -- he knows the secret recipe and accepts no substitutions. Highly recommended!
