Child psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe is confronted one night by his former patient Vincent Gray who he failed to help. After Vincent shoots Crowe in the stomach and kills himself, Crowe can't stop thinking about it. A few months later he is hired to help a troubled boy named Cole Sear, who has many of the same problems Vincent had. Crowe sees a chance to redeem himself, but doubts his ability to reach the boy, particularly when Cole claims to see ghosts who don't know they're dead.

Right off, I'll say this is one of the best films ever. It currently ranks #3 for M. Night's films. I love this movie because it's a really good ghost story and has a thought-provoking plot.

Yeah, this film was famous so I already knew the ending before it even happened but that didn't distract me from watching the movie. Throughout the movie is a masterpiece.

The acting by Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, and Toni Collette were all fantastic and some like Olivia Williams and Donnie Wahlberg were all great, too.

If you want an intelligent ghost movie with some scares and twists and turns, this is the movie for you. It's not just a plain old stupid scary movie. It has a story and great acting.
