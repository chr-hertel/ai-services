If I were to sum up Human Nature in three words, I would say: screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malckovich). Three other words? Direcctor Michelle Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind).

Give these two a powerful cast with Patricia Arquette, Tim Robbins and Miranda Otto and you've got yourself a winner. Alas, the real star of the film is Rhys Ifans, who plays the bizarre Puff, a modern-day Tarzan who discovers the human race after decades of wild life. This weird and ironic tale also includes a lonely wolf woman, highly intelligent mice and a man pondering about his life right after his death. Trust me, it doesn't get any better than this.
