I watched this film because i had heard so much about it and it lived up to they hype. The film is totally gripping and Forrest Wittaker is superb as the dictator. I didn't stop watching the film for one second throughout you simply couldn't. Both Whittaker's and the Scottish doctor are very charming characters particularly Whittaker's in the beginning.

Its rare to see such a fantastic film as this which moves at a nice pace pealing away the layer of the dictators true persona and having such a great cast and great acting as well.

Its a pity Gillian Andersons character didn't get more time on screen as shes such a great actress and of course beautiful.

A superb film 9/10
