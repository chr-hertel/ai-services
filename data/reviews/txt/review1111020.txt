Now this movie was far from perfect, but not so far off, to have been bad. Intelligent zombies? I wasn't ready for that. However, I can say it was done well enough. A satire on the rich and the poor (of course the rich all lose and the poor 'prosper'), working class vs. elite, zombie vs. prostitute (I'm surprised it took this long to get to the old fashion lion vs. gladiator theme...). Why is US currency still the dominant trading tool? Why not guns, ammo, food? What do Zombies need human flesh for? This is something I've never understood. In a previous movie they explained zombies don't need to eat, they just do. But why do they walk around till their conked in the head? Do they starve? Do they have a life expectancy? How does their brain operate if they don't breathe or eat? Overall it was an enjoyable movie. The opening credits were well done, but it was followed up with 10 minutes of tedium (even though it was right into the movie with the action). Once the core characters got back to the city the movie never lost steam. The gore. Outstanding. Peeled back nails. Hand down the throat to rip out the insides. Heads hanging from a thread. Hands ripped in half. Tom Savini in a quick cameo as a zombie. The Shaun of the Dead boys as zombies (I can't say I saw them, but I saw their names in the credits) and a co-worker says he saw Duane from Degrassi Junior High (he had AIDS on the show and beat up Joey) as a bettor in the ring scene. If you like zombie flicks, you'll dig this flick.
