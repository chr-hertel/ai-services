you know, had this film starred anyone else, it probably would end up with a rating of about 5 or 6 out of 10

that said, had this film starred anyone else it probably would have been reached the top ten of the box office (it debuted at no.2)or landed this much attention.

what does that say?

That Britney's star power made this film both a success and a failure. People watched it because of her, people talk about it because of her and people judge it far too harshly because of her. 

The film is predictable stuff, but what isn't? The acting is not that bad, Britney is able to squeeze out empathy in one scene and her character is charming, albeit too syrupy. The film itself doesn't tread too harsh a territory but it shouldn't have too. 

Anyone else, and people would possibly praise it, and forgive its unoriginality. But then, had this been anyone else, you wouldn't be reading this.
