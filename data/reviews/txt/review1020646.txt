Billy Wilder at his very best again. Punchy, hard and brutal. You don't like anyone in the film - your're not meant to and it's all the better for it. Kirk Douglas is a loud-mouthed, down at heel has-been reporter who seizes on an opportunity of a man trapped in a mine as his meal ticket back to the big time. He has his town hangers on and nearing the end of the film the whole town and beyond is feverish with the publicity, all making a tidy little profit (hamburger stalls circus's fairgrounds etc..) Kirk's relationship with the waitress, herself wanting a meal ticket passage out of town, is fantastically well read. She's tough, she's always had the bad hand in life but compared to kirk, she's a pussycat. In one scene she retorts to Kirk "I've met a lot of hard-boiled eggs in my time, but you--you're twenty minutes" A must see-film and certainly in the top 100 of all time.
