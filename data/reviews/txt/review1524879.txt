I just thought I would comment on this wonderful film. Not only did it have a wonderful actor like John Hurt but the reality of the film really got to me very much and I have recommended it to anyone I see. I am working in a national DVD shop and recommend it all the time. No words can really describe what went on and also what is going on at the present time. I wish I could help but Im helpless. My prayers and thoughts go out to the people in Darfur at present. The night I watched it I cried a lot and then I bought the film. More films like this should be made to highlight the atrocities that are " allowed " to go on with blind eyes shown.
