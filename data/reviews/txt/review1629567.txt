yentl is one of those movies that sticks to one's head. it has a whole lot of ideas that plant themselves like seeds in the psyche--it opens the eyes, widens the perspective, and can change thought patterns. well, in my case, it changed the way i felt about barbra streisand from lukewarm to gung-ho. and more profoundly, it made the depressed fresh grad that i was feel like she can do anything and be anything. that was just too cool to forget.

the music makes the film, i think. the melodies are moving and are widely appealing, and yet if fits soooo perfectly against the turn of the century, rural Jewish village background of the film. but the lyrics are the ones that make the film truly earth-shaking. there's poetry and there's the punch of emancipating ideas, and there's the beautiful poetry in the way they are expressed.
