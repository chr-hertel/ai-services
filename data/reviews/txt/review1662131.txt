This episode features Optimus Prime first appearance on season 3 since he died in Transformers the movie, making it one of my favorite episodes of season 3(not many i might add)besides that it was informative by taking on right were the movie ended, and unlike other episodes you can see characters from the 3 seasons interacting together. However i have the feeling this episode was a gimmick to try to salvage season 3 due to low ratings.If you notice they portrayed Optimus as sick, disturb,unstable, unreliable, therefore unfit to be the Autobots leader; on the other hand we get to see a very powered Rodimus that is ratified as the new leader by Optimus and receives the matrix, later on Optimus dies again.They also showed fans how the corpses of the fallen Autobots were destroyed in a red sun,eliminating any hope of fans of a comeback(we are reminded of that by Kup by the way).Bottom line, accept season 3 new format. Luckily for fans and viewers, they brought back Optimus definitely on the 2 last episodes of season 3: The Return of Optimus Prime(although this episode was the perfect opportunity for that).
