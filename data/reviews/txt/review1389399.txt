The story is great but if it was the real story of Monica Bedi and the gangster it would have been great. Before Shiny Ahuja other actors were given the role but they backed out: Sanjay Dutt: good thing he said no, too old now. John Abraham: biggest mistake in his career. His movies are good but not many people go see them, Gangster is one movie he should have done. Shoaib Akthar: he cant act so good he said no. Actors should have been given the role:Irfan Khan: great actor but not getting big budget movies with dark stories. (See him in Maqbool great stories)Great music, all the songs in that movie are mostly copied from another music not Bollywood music. the music is still great. gotta give it to Pritam for copying music and still making it better than the original. Anurga Basu should make more movies like this. After murder he rushed into Tumsa Nahin Dekha. I hope he does not do the same mistake again. Take your time Anurag. Emraan Hashmi is one of those actors who always has great music in his movies. i guess the luck comes from his uncle Mahesh Bhatt who always had good music no matter how the movies were.
