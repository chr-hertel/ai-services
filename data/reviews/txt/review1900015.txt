I know a lot of people don't seem to understand M Night Shyamalan. I really enjoy his films and with the exception of 'Signs', I have always found so much to think about and talk about after. This is no exception and I was pleasantly surprised after having read the reviews.

If you liked the mellow side of Sixth Sense, and the un-Hollywood drama of Lady in the Water, then I think you will enjoy this film. I know that it has been said that the characters react in very odd ways  but I would say that this was a lot more true to life. There is a real Hitchcock feel to the whole thing. If he was making films now, this is what I think he would be doing.

I've never seen Mark Wahlberg in a bad film, and this is no exception. From the way he deals with his students at the beginning, to the way his character adapts to the tale as it unfolds  it's all excellent stuff. The reaction of other characters - from their voyeuristic fascination, to their complete non-reaction, was refreshingly realistic.

I haven't enjoyed a film this much since Lord of the Rings. It's not an action movie, - it is more intelligent than that.
