This movie is much ado about nothing. But, then, what could you expect out of Dubuque, Iowa, where nothing ever happened except the filming of F.I.S.T.? The early 1980s was a big beer-drinking time, though, with everyone partying and being an urban cowboy. This movie is basically a chance to see an early version of Bob Chandler's Bigfoot (before he was such a monster) and hear some country music. It's kind of a lighthearted, fun, partying romp. In fact, the writer very well could have written this movie in a state of intoxication. There's a scene where Robert Hays's character is supposed to throw a beer can into a trash can. Duh! Iowa beverage cans had a 5 cent deposit on them. This must have been written by someone from out of state!
