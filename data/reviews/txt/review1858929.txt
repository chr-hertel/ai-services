The return of one movie that changed the minds of the world comedic geniuses, this movie was a great sequel in all aspect, lets start with Kal Penns character, what a great way to add to career, after Namesake and White Castle, this movie easily was amongst his best performances, hes still one of the best comedic people alive, every scene with harold was hilarious, the scene during the plane and getting on was amazing, truly enjoyed the scene with them going on, and lets get to Harolds character, he felt a lot more loose for this movie, his character was more loosely based, and he had a lot of dramatic scenes in this movie then the first one that he did. He is credible in this movie more then Kumar because finding the girl from the first one, the only thing I guess I didn't enjoy was the second half of the movie, first half was very well written but the second half could've been better, and the ending was the whole best part about the movie, I was shocked to see the way the movie ended, I was happy for the way the director added that famous person from the first movie, Forgot his name but still it was a good movie, everyone who is a harold and kumar see this one, you will not be disappointed!
