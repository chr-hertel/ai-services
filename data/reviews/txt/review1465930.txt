Thrill of a Romance Esther Williams Van Johnson

I did not see the movie but my father saw it last night and said it was wonderful and he especially liked the song by Lauritz Melchiore. He wants to find a copy of the recording that Lauritz Melchiore sang in this movie---something about "please don't say no, say maybe...come back in the spring but don't say maybe..." I can download to a disc if I know where to go???? I guess I can order the movie also, but one website said not available.

Anyone know?

Thanks, Lee Ann
