I think Alain Resnais definitively put the shoulder at the wheel for the modern cinema effort with this one. Not that I was deeply touched by the acting or by the plot, but the editing is where everything is tumbling. Resnais literally put up in images some obscure and thick literary movements like James Joyce's own "stream of consciousness".

It's for hardcore cinema addicts, it's interestingly build, and it's totally new(for the era). Resnais strikes me as one of the best(or THE best) director coming out of the french new wave. "Hiroshima Mon amour" it before it's time and should be praised for it's audacity. Alain Resnais is a big step forward for modernity. He's often overshadowed by attention addicts like Godard, but he definitively is(in my opinion) the most impressive director of all the new wave.
