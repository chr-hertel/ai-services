i knew before i saw this movie that danny cannon(judge dredd) had directed it, i knew before i saw this movie that this film wasn't really aimed at me(an 37 year old tottenham hotspurs fan), but what i didn't know before i saw this was that i would waste TWO WHOLE HOURS on one of the worst films i'd ever seen! i haven't checked the crew list, but i would be DEEPLY surprised if the guys who do the editing and music on C.S.I. were not involved. now i have to say, i'm a big fan of C.S.I. and C.S.I. Miami. the stories and production in both those shows, normally involve a lot of imagination and are technically excellent, for a television show.

unfortunately, this is a two hour movie. the story, the acting, the directing, the editing, the music are awful. frankly there are NO redeeming aspects of this film.

my last words on this film are: two hours of your life, you will NEVER, EVER, EVER get back!!! when you're on your deathbed and begging death for more time, to be with your family or to swim with dolphins or just to sit in the park, he's going to ask you one question "did you sit through ALL of goal?" you'll know what answer to give him....
