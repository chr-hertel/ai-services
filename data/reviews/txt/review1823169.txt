Amazing. Fantastic. Classic. Entertaining. Scary. Fun. Everything a great film should be and have, great actors, superb script, amazing director and just an absolute joy to watch over and over and over again. MY personal favourite movie of all time and it was released on the year i was born in 1975. Sad to hear that Roy Scheider has died - he is Chief Martin Brody! Legend! R.I.P. to Roy and also Robert Shaw and Peter Benchley for giving me my all time favourite and truly one of it's kind- JAWS ! 10 outta 10! " You're gonna need a bigger boat!" - what a line! I've gotta add a couple lines in order to submit my comments on Jaws so i have to say that seeing Ben Gardner's head pop out the bottom of the boat was truly terrifying to a 5 year old when i watched it then and nothing has topped that since! Thank You Steven Spielberg and big up to Richard Dreyfuss, Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton for being part of it all. Cheers!
