1st watched 12/15/2006 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Jill Culton, Roger Allers & Anthony Stacchi): OK, Shrek-like story about a couple of animal misfits who link up with the rest of the animal kingdom in the backwoods to fight against the human hunters when it's open season. The story starts off as a pet-like grizzly bear named Boog(voiced by Martin Lawrence) has it easy living in the garage of a kind of circus-like handler of a outdoorsy show for the parks department. Ashton Kutcher is the voice of a deer who arrives mounted on the car of a hunter and Boog lets him go. Boog then gets released by his handler to the wild and the Shrek-like imitation starts with the two trying to be Shrek & Donkey on a trek to get back to Boog's original home. There are some funny scenes with Kutcher being his goofy self in a great role for him and some classic uses of normal objects as weapons in the fight scene against the hunters, but not enough to sustain the full-length movie. The music(another attempt at Shrek-imitation) is also pretty lame. This movie will definitely not last too long or be recognized as much in the annals of animation history, in my opinion.
