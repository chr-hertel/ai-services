"If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything." 

This is a film where anything is possible and what every single person has once dreamt about.....embarking on time travel.

This an enjoyable and satisfying film about a teenage boy (Marty) being forced to go back in time using the iconic flux capacitor invented by Emmet "Doc" Brown. While Marty is back in time he inavertely changes the future which includes him never existing.

Not only is this a nostalgic snapshot of what the 50's used to be like, its also a vivid juxtaposition of time periods (50's and 80's). It has clever and slick references to the differences in the 50's to the 80's and how naive people were.

Is this an epic masterpiece? No, but its a big achievement in cinema because it brings a lot of peoples impossible dreams alive. This is probably one of the greatest comedies ever and is definitely Micheal J fox's best film so far. 9/10 A must see
