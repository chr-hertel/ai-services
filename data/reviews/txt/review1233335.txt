First of all, don't let the NC-17 fool you: this is not a porn flick (in its home country, Italy, it was rated "forbidden under 14 years"), although the sex scenes are a bit explicit; it's a love-letter by Bernardo Bertolucci to French cinema, particularly the New Wave, as well as classics from the Hollywood Golden Age.

Paris, 1968, a few months before the students riots begin. Matthew (Michael Pitt), a young American who's there to study French, spends most of his time at the Cinemathèque Française, where he meets fellow film lover Isabelle (Eva Green) and her twin brother Thèo (Louis Garrel), who let him live with them. Once Isa and Thèo's parents are out of town, the fun begins: games, debates and arguments about movies (from Chaplin to Godard, from Sam Fuller to Howard Hawks). Then the three youngsters decide to bring their relationship to a more, uh, intimate level...

Movie-buffs are gonna love the first half of the movie, where the protagonists' (and the director's) love for classic films is visible in every frame (the debate about the greatest comedian ever - Chaplin or Keaton - is brilliant), while in the second part the sex takes over, though still connected to cinema (the first sex acts are punishments for losing a homemade movie quiz), and it's pretty graphic lovemaking indeed (but what would you expect from the man who gave us Last Tango in Paris?)...

A very interesting and well acted movie, although it's slightly disappointing that Bertolucci doesn't give us more than a glimpse of the riots which should have had a more important role, given the time and place the story is set in. Other than that, The Dreamers doesn't seem to have any significant flaws.
