I recorded that movie on tape from TV because the story is so amazing from a spiritual point of view, playing with Angels and Heaven like Hollywood knew to do it long time ago without taking the thing too seriously. A part of the movie at the end when Cameron get out from the back of the car to save Ewan from the death had retained my attention. In the background, there is a music playing i'm looking for, it sounds like Techno or Dance and i' like to know who's playing as it seems not to be part of the soundtrack. Does Anyone know the name of that music ? It would be so nice to forward it to me. I reviewed lot of comments about this soundtrack and never found what i was searching here.
