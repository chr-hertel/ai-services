I thought this movie was great. It wasn't Oscar-worthy, but it's a light-hearted romance/comedy played out by some great acting and costumes. This is the first time Jack Black made a positive impression on me (although he was fun in High Fidelity--just not a large role). Aside from his cuckoo clock impression, I thought his comedic and dramatic lines were equally enjoyable and convincing. Gwyneth is always sweet and funny and her comedic timing is right on. There are plenty of funny lines. There are also plenty of beautiful, charming actresses here. No nudity, no sex--just plain fun and warmth. And there are some touching moments with unfortunate children. I didn't find this movie offensive to overweight or less-than-appealing people. The people represented in this film are very exaggerated. These characters are also very comfortable with themselves. The message under the laughs is simple and obvious, but that's not what makes it a good film. And the ending is so touching and not entirely predictable. I watch it every time I catch it on the air. I rate it a 7 out of 10.
