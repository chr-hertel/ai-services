It will be a propaganda film, but patriotic talk of a true story, remarkable scenes dynamics, the attacks against the Slavs. And 'some' surreal in some scenes, but ultimately can be fine. I do not understand why we need to criticize the story really happened, fear the reality? I do not know who say, is a film vedibile. Cmq I am tired of reading your stupid opinions, this is a zoo, a caravanserai, here anyone can write what he wants, I bet that you have put Rambo 10 but goes. Write what you want, ultimately each of us is to judge what he wants. Even the most ignorant and illiterate, have made a miserable 7 titanic. Goodbye! I broke boxes.
