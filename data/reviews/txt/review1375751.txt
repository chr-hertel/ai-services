Saw the complete version on Encore West last nite; I was disappointed. Despite the presence of two great stars in Glenn Ford (3:10 from Yuma) and William Holden (Wild Bunch/Stalag 17) the film is far from a classic. It starts out with great potential as a battle fatigued Colonel Owen Devereaux played by Ford massacres a 100 troop Confederate party (they have plainly raised their white flag)just as the Civil War ends. Captain Del Stewart played by Holden - looking more the Hollywood golden boy than a war weary officer, immediately deduces that Ford has massacred the troop. He is a loyal long time friend and keeps his powder (and makeup) dry. After being mustered out (with little time to ketchup with their mutual girlfriend) Ford gets appointed a Federal Judge ( Owen to the lack of any sanity clause in his commission) and Holden is named US Marshal. The first trial he presides over is one of the film's better scenes and shows how following the law doesn't always result in justice.

Ford continues to slip deeper into insanity. He's a hangin judge you don't want to hang with. So what is the film's point? There was no hint of is illness to anyone but Holden before his high appointment so I'm lost as to the film's message. Power can corrupt, but Ford is not corrupt; the war has simply driven him mad. He must kill anyone who threatens him. He is not portrayed as a tragic figure.

Look for Edgar Buchanan on leave from the Shadyrest playing the town doc and Ford's uncle. Perhaps a six month tour of Petticoat Junction would have been all Ford needed. I've enjoyed Holden in lots of flicks, but the guy's just too handsome and cleancut to be one day ex-military. He reminds me of the US interim provost in Iraq- Paul Bremer . The guy's clothes, beard and hair were always perfect while Iraq burned
