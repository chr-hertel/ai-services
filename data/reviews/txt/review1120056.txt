whether you are a purist or not, this film left me running for the door, and not in a good way. movie starts off promising, cool renegades etc etc, but basically every character is shallow and transparent. we have seen these characters in every movie... the tough renegade turned good guy, the good guy who always watches out for his fellow man, the prostitute with a heart of gold, the idiot savant, the evil fat cat at the top... i mean come on. 25 min into the film and i was ready to leave. the gore was laughable and over used, the plot line was not bad, the last bastion of hope being the fortified city was pretty cool but that was about it.

the dawn of the dead remake was 1000x better, better acting, better dialog, better effects. g.a.r. might have invented the zombie flick and i'll give him his props, but lets let it go [ by the way, he owes me $13 for this movie + popcorn lets make it a cool $20 ] if you want to see an original zombie movie check out 28 days later or Shaun of the dead which were both excellent.
