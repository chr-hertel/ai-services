I just came from a special screening of this short film, part of the Sydney Travelling Film festival, where Michael Bates, the director, was in attendance and spoke to the audience before and after the screening.

The Projectionist is somewhat of a confusing film to classify. It uses the technique of pixilation, therefore it straddles live action and animation. Basically, its stop motion but with humans. This gives the picture a very unique look. The film shows the slow walk of a projectionist through the city of Sydney, while his life plays out as projections on the walls around him.

The concept's good and it looks fabulous, but it doesn't do anything. The problem is there is no emotion. You can't connect with the character and therefore are unable to feel anything towards him, leaving you as an observer, and by the end it becomes monotonous.

If you can, see Famed, a previous Michael Bates pixilation work, and a much more emotive and stunning piece.
