Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is the best of all star wars movies. The powerful Jedi-knight Anakin Skywalker leaves The Jedi Council en joins the evil Darth Sidious. He is a sith lord and want to kill all Jedi master, especially his nemesis master Yoda. The only sad thing about the film is that Anakin turns to the dark side. Great film, especially the picture quality. It is the second film, after Star Wars 2 Attack of the Clones that is digitally recorded. I purchased the DVD and the picure quality is stunning. The best thing about the film is that the action is breathtaking. I can recommend this film to any moviefan. It's a shame if you don't find this movie a masterpiece. Praise George Lucas.
