An interesting film; and enough to pass the time. Pre - "Exotica" Mia Kirschner and pre - "Squanto" Adam Beach were definitely the show stealers - however, given the rather subdued acting in much of the film, this is not saying much. What annoyed me most was the tendency to patronize rural Nova Scotia, by filling Ingonish with one - dimensional yokels, whose sole concerns are bagpipes, Ceilidhs, and tea.

If you happen to have an interest in Nova Scotia, I'd suggest "New Waterford Girl"; "Cadillac Girls" barely registers a blip on the interest meter. Nevertheless, I'd recommend it for those whose interest in regional films of Nova Scotia is purely academic.
