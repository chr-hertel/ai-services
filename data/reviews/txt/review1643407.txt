Disturbia Rocks! This is one of the best movies I have seen all year. Its a suspenseful thriller that keeps you on the edge on your seat the whole time.

Its about a young boy who got sentence to house arrest for punching on of his teachers. He starts to watch the neighbors because his mom took away all of his electronics. He starts to notice something strange about his next door neighbor. And he decides to investigate. Since he can't leave his house he has his friends spy on the neighbor for him. But What the boy doesn't know is that his neighbor has been watching him also and knows hes spying on him.
