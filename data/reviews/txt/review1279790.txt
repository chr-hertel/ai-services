James Stewart and Donna Reid at their respective bests. A heartwarming tale of a status we would all aspire, to be loved by many and respected by all. And, to have the ability to realize first hand, the impact our lives had in this world. I've watched this movie literally, hundreds of times and do so, every time it is on television.

Some years ago, I found a copy of this film in the bargain basket at a mall media store. Amazingly, I paid a fee of less than five dollars for a movie worth more than most of what comes out of Hollywood today. Few places can you find a movie that will make you cry as well as making you feel exhilarated and good about yourself as "It's a Wonderful Life". While it is an old clich√©', it applies here that "they don't make 'em like that anymore".
