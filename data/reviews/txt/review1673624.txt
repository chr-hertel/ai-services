I've been watching "Divine Design" for several years and it's truly become my favorite HGTV show. It's true that the intent is not to stimulate the viewers into getting ideas for designing beautifully with low budgets, like the majority of the other design teams in other shows, but I can't argue against her. One of the differences is that she's a gifted professional, with a qualified team, unlike teams like the various ones on "Design on a Dime". I love the sketches that she makes, which clearly demonstrate her organization and competence as an artist. And of course, her humor and her and her team's funny clips where they dress up and do some skits and stuff, which are indispensable in the show.
