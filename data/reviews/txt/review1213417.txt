This movie is one of the best i ever saw along with saving private Ryan the green mile and doctor patch .

the frame line is regulated with clever humor , there are historical facts and most of all truth in it . The context is variated ,it addresses to teenagers to grown ups .

Great one, i'm currently going to look for other films made by this realist .

if you want to find good vibrations , see hope and a guideline to spirit , look at it .

(you really want to see this movie . )
