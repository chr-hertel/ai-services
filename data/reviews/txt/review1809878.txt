You don't have to play a note of music to enjoy 'Note By Note:The Making Of Steinway L1037'. This is a loving Valentine to instrument making & music in general. We get to see the Steinway piano being produced over a one year period, from trees in the forest, to the finished product. The film is rife with interview footage with the workers who poured their life & love into this (and all of the)piano. The film also gets screen time with interviews with figures from the musical world (Harry Connick,Jr.Lang Lang,etc.). This film,like the piano itself is a labour of love & is well worth seeking out. Distribution is a bit limited,due to it's release on video,but will be well received when it is released on DVD.
