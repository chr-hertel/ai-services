Even though I am a ''car guy'', when I first saw the previews I was like, ''Talking cars? Allllrighty then.'' I was very very very wrong. You forget early in the movie that cars can't talk, and the opening scene really grips you. Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy are great in this movie, and pretty much all the other voices are perfect too. AWESOME animation, Pixar's best in my opinion. The jokes are very funny, and there is quite a bit of hidden adult humor that will just go right over the kids heads. Soundtrack is great (along with everything else about this movie), containing a good variety of music. This movie is not just for kids and car lovers, but everybody will enjoy it!
