I thought the movie was excellent. Definitely a THRILL RIDE!!!!! I just have one question. Who had the final decision to run Elvis Presley's song "If I Can Dream" during the final credits? I found that a very interesting to say the least! Thanks I hope someone can give me the answer. I do not recall little if any music during the movie,accept for some bar scenes. Kate Hudson was very convincing as a serious actress contrary to any other role that she has played. Gena Rowlands is such a great actress. Is she in a position now where she can pick a script,because lately,well her last two movies have been excellent. Back to the Skeleton Key, I think it is one of the best movies of the summer. My favorite was Cinderella Man but now I'm not real sure. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone who likes a sit on the edge of your seat thriller and DO NOT go anywhere during the last Forty-five minutes of this movie!!
