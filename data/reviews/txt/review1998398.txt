This is an odd case of the film's style and acting being so good that it made up for huge plot holes in the film. Even those who love this film like I do will usually honestly admit that the murder mystery is muddled and made little sense. However, this doesn't really seem to matter that much since the mood, acting and dialog are so exceptional, this seems to be a film that can even overcome plot problems.

The best part about this film, by far, is Humphrey Bogart. His Phillip Marlowe is terrific--sarcastic, tough and blunt. Hearing him spit out great one-liners is something you just have to see to believe and even some of the minor scenes (such as the one in the book shop) come off wonderfully due to his characterization. It sure helped that he was ably assisted by a great supporting staff (especially Lauren Bacall), but even without them this would have been a first-rate film due to Bogey.

The direction also deserves a lot of credit. Howard Hawkes sure did a good job of setting the Film Noir atmosphere. Exceptional camera work, music, lighting and pacing all made this a sit on the edge of your seat type of film.

As for the story, Marlowe is called in to help a rich old man find a missing friend. However, what happens next and all the twists and turns just don't add up to a lot--especially when you find out who did the crime and why. But don't worry--you can actually look past this!! 

By the way, although I loved Bogart, I also really loved Robert Montgomery's version of this character in THE LADY IN THE LAKE. While not necessarily better or worse than Bogey's version of the character, he was nastier and more sarcastic (while Bogart was a little more self-confident and tough). In fact, I am shocked this other movie isn't just as famous as THE BIG SLEEP--it definitely deserves to be and would make a great double-feature.
