I finally finished Evolution, after falling asleep to it like 5 times. I'm not sure who this film was meant for. It had high school type of science with elementary/junior high humor. I'm not sure yet, but I don't think I liked this movie at all. There were a couple parts I kind of went "hmph" in a laughing matter, but nothing that deserves a 5.8 rating on IMDb. What's with that by the way? I mean I see pretty decent movies on IMDb that are low, I mean like cute little comedies like Mannequin or Simply Irresistible that just make you feel good at the end. But somehow "Evolution" got a 5.8? I'd just like to know how? It's really not that good of a movie. If this was from "X-Files" fans, wow. I really hope it's not, because there are more deserving movies of a higher rating. This has no structure, good acting, or actual comedy to it. Please, just review the film one more time before giving this film any points higher than a 3.
