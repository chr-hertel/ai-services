Though sub-par acting can almost be forgivable, due to its own absolute laugh-ability, when it is coupled with pathetic CGI efforts and an even worse plot line, you have yourself a cancer of the IQ. Sci-fi Channel has produced better made-for-TV movies, including Frankenfish and Lake Placid II. Yeah... I said it.

Watch at your own risk. If you entered into the endeavor moderately intelligent, the stupidity gained as a result of watching this film will be temporary. If you entered into the viewing of this "film" with abject adoration, then I fear your newfound stupidity will stick. In such an instance, I'll be sure to pray for you. Long and hard.
