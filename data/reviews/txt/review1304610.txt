This movie is dopey and pointless. What particularly bothered me was that in the original SWAMP THING, Louis Jourdan was the bad guy. In the end, he was transformed into a hideous monster and ultimately was destroyed by Swamp Thing. However, in this sequel, of sorts, once again Louis Jourdan returns as the bad guy. Now, he might be a really resilient guy but this is ridiculous!! Why couldn't they have at least gotten a different actor so as to maintain some continuity? Regardless, this is just a re-hash of old stuff and offers nothing new of necessary. The original was fresh and mildly interesting--this film is just an old re-tread.
