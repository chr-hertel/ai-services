I was not aware of there being a Jesus Christ Superstar (JCS) film before I read its article on Wikipedia. I am glad that I discovered it.

JSC, if you don't know what it is (and in that case, where have you been?) is a rock musical composed by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber. If you know about Jesus's final hours of life, then you will be familiar with the events in this musical. However, the production team has opted to put a contemporary spin on this much loved composition, so expect to see guns and television sets.

The performances are of high quality. Glenn Carter is excellent as Jesus Christ, Jerome Pradon is outstanding as Judas Iscariot and Renee Castle is lovely as Mary Magdalene. In fact, the ensemble cast is great as well.

Some of the scenes reminded me of other musicals. The second song, "What's the buzz?" is very West Side Story, and if you think of "And all that jazz" from Chicago then you can draw comparisons to of King Herod Song. This is a good thing, because I enjoyed those musicals as much as this one.

The director mentioned in the "Making of JSC" featurette that he wanted this film to appeal to 20 year olds and 30 year olds, not just the people who grew up with the musical. As a 20 year old, I can say he has certainly succeeded.
