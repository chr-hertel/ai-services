When this movie came out, I was kinda happy. I've watched the original and didn't think it was great. So I thought maybe with our technology now a days, this film could be better than the original.

Wow! how I was wrong. The movie was just another example of how Hollywood changes stories to make them more suitable for them to make. This is a true story, how can you change it around? The beginning is suppose to be the scariest part, but in this movie it was just pointless.

They should have spent a little more time on casting, just because, nobody fits their parts. I can't imagine being afraid of Ryan Reynolds and I think the kid that played Billy Lutz was much older than he should have been. I didn't think much of Melissa George as Kathy Lutz, but that could have been because the writing for her was pretty bad.

This is not the movie's fault, but when I went to see it I had this girl behind me was talking about how she was sick and she needed to throw up. That took me out of the movie watching mood. Please people, if you are sick or feel like you're going to be sick stay home or leave the theater silently and go home. Don't announce it.

To my understanding both movies are not what really happened, only certain parts. So I guess neither one of them had it right, maybe I should just read the book.
