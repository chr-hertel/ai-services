I've been watching season 3 so far out of obligation. Week after week the episodes were fairly uninspired and too "kiddy" for the most part. I don't mean that there aren't "adult" situations (most via violence), but I say "kiddy" in the sense of abandoning the logic of internal consistency, and THE WAY PEOPLE BEHAVE. The previous two-parter where The Doctor becomes human was quite good for the most part (but still had the wooden behaviour apparent especially in the villains).

Now comes Blink. Holy mackerel! I wonder why this episode is so radically better than most of the others. Is it a fluke? Or is the team that made this simply unavailable for most of the other episodes?

It's the only one I just had to watch from the beginning immediately after (not because I didn't get it, but because it was so damn good).
