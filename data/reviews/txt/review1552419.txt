I was very curious about this movie since I've seem its trailer. Basically the plot is very weak plus the way the movie develops the result is very far from a good terror movie. Characters are superficial and actors wasn't in their best work. I think the director of this movie wanted to base it with a mix of ghosts special effects and suspense but the last ingredient was just too little for this purpose and the result is just like a 90 minutes so-so episode of Twinlight Zone. I just liked the dark look of this movies, just like you see in "Underworld" or "Gattaca". If you want to watch it I recommend you to wait it being presented on cable TV because you'll spend your money renting/buying the DVD.
