Martin Scorsese's biopic "The Aviator" does a powerful job portraying the eccentric life of Howard Hughes and his love of aviation, his obsession with women and film and his ability to take risks. 

Leonardo Di Caprio is believable as Hughes. We have watched DiCaprio mature before our eyes from "Titanic" to "Gangs of New York" to "Catch Me if You Can" to the young Hughes. He is so good that sooner or later he will win the Oscar. Hopefully it will be this time!

One of the best things about seeing a historical figure on the big screen is we learn things we never knew. Katharine Hepburn falls for the dashing, powerful, handsome and rich Hughes. If bored at a party, Hughes would take his date for a late night plane ride over Hollywood. We can understand Hepburn better after seeing her tumultuous life with Hughes and then falling for Spencer Tracy who was calm and steadying. You must find out what Hughes does to protect his old flame. 

Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn is worth the price of your ticket. She recreates Hepburn from the staccato voice to her aristocratic walk. 

The film accurately shows Hughes's struggle with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder that manifested in his incessant washing of hands, his fear of germs and his withdraw from life in his later years. Today, those suffering can receive treatment, unlike Hughes who did not. 

Not all moviegoers will appreciate the details of building his planes and some will be bored with too much time spent on the scenes of his early film, Hell's Angels. As the owner of TWA, Hughes took on Congress and the powerful Pan Am to hone in on the overseas monopoly. Who knows where aviation would be if not for the vision and daring of Hughes, including a fiery plane crash. This Must See film is at the top of my list for Best Picture and Best Actor.
