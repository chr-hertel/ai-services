It was my father who recommended me to see this film when it premiered on the television. I knew that it was supposed to be marvelous and therefore I had high expectations right for the start. And, thank God, I wasn't disappointed at all!

Julia plays a stalwart, authoritative, somewhat arrogant woman with amazing adroitness. She is so good in this role that you ignore all her cursing and yet love her. Albert Finney too plays his role well though I thought that he could have been better in some shots. Eckhart too does a really good job as a 'maid/lover' of Erin .

What I feel that could have improved was the character development. I felt that nothing changed in the character's traits. Also, some of the sub-plots could have been handled better. Its a monster of a story and that's why probably it wasn't possible to focus on all the characters and give them more attention.

The story is absolutely tremendous with fabulous and witty dialogs. The "It's called b00bs" line is my favorite. The ending is satisfactory. The main punch of this movie is that it never gets dull even though its a bit long. Well, to be frank, I felt that they could have increased the pace in some of the scenes but that didn't make it completely unenlightening.

Overall, I'm going to give this an eight. Don't forget to catch it on the television. If this 15 year old loves it, then I feel that it would be relished by almost anyone.
