I actually missed watching Vendetta in the cinema and saw it recently on DVD....... i was happy i did not miss it the second time.

The movie was dark,gripping, intelligent and littered with wonderful dialogue and performances. Hugo Weaving was awesome as V, while using only his voice and body language to come to grips with his masked character. Rea was good as the detective and i also liked John Hurt and the actor playing Prothero the voice of London.... there's nothing like a cultured British Accent to add gravitas to well written dialogue.

Is it me or is Natalie portman more alluring when she is sprouting lines in a British accent (you might have guessed by now that I like that). Jokes apart.. the two main characters were played wonderfully by Portman and Weaving, there was definite chemistry there.

As for the movie.... good script, great visuals and good direction making it a polished product that should be seen on the big screen to get a feel for the atmospheric vocalization of London.

One of the best movies of 2005.
