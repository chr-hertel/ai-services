I think "Riki-Oh" is a film that crosses barriers. It's part martial arts, part prison drama, part horror....all washed down with over-the-top action and violence, delivered with a comic twist.

The film is based on a Manga comic and tells the tale of the incarcerated Ricky, imprisoned for taking revenge on the killers of his girlfriend. In prison, Ricky fights for survival and justice against a number of unusual enemies. It's a simple enough tale but one that is delivered in a very entertaining way - I watched it with a very big grin! Although it appears to have been made on a shoe-string budget, this Hong Kong produced film is high on originality and is a great beer and popcorn movie. Invite some friends over - this film is best enjoyed with company. It's great fun and well worth a rental. I bought blind and certainly don't regret it.
