This movie is very beautiful. I love the photography, light and colors used along the scenes. It's a very good work that catches the eyes, really.

Story is very interesting although quite boring in some parts. But it's not a problem at all. You'll enjoy it a lot if you like historic movies.

The play of the actors is impressive. Kate Blanchet is perfect in this movie.

I saw this movie before I knew it is a sequel of the another movie, Elizabeth, and I'm looking forward to watch this other one too.
