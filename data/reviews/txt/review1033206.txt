I fully agree with the excellent but mostly negative reviews of many authors on this site.This movie is essentially amoral in the sense that it abuses recent historical facts by an utterly simplistic approach.It is also an apology of the heroics of war at a time many of us are truly concerned with the rising loss of young American lives in Iraq.The theme is an upgraded version of the war epics during the 1940's, when heroes such as Errol Flynn eliminated uncountable Japanese divisions single-handed."The Thin Red Line" for example depicted war as it really is and appealed to so many of us as it made us think."Behind Enemy Lines" uses or abuses a "true story" to reduce it to a child-like representation of violence and death.
