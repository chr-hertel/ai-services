Absorbing documentary about midnight movies--how they started, why they existed and did so well and what killed them. It deals with six key movies--El Topo; Night of the Living Dead; The Harder They Come; Pink Flamingoes; Rocky Horror Picture Show and Eraserhead. They interview the directors and distributors of all six films and they discuss how they got them out and the reactions of critics and audiences. It also explains why these movies were only successful as midnight movies (Rocky Horror was a disaster when it came out as a regular movie).

I'm old enough to remember midnight movies and how much fun they were. They're gone forever but this wonderful documentary brought it all back to me. Also there's a HUGE amount of footage from each film. Highly recommended.
