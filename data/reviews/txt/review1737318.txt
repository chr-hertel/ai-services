i found this documentary amazing! i am an Indigenous Australian and this movie gives a very different approach to discussing the current situations of Indigenous peoples in Australia.

it goes through some historical aspects of Australian settlement and Christian missions and there impacts on Indigenous people lives (wholistically).

i think this documentary gives us a brief look into what future Indigenous leaders will be like with great knowledge and pride in their culture. give it a look and see some reasons why Indigenous people have the issues they have.
