Christmas Vacation is one of the best comedy films i've seen.It has all the attributes of a good comedy,with a fantastic cast playing such good roles.This is a comedy you can watch "time and time" again not just at Chritmas time,i have the "National Lampoons Collection Box Set" which i treasure.Their a type of film that take the stress of work away when you get home.I hope their are many more National Lampoon films to come, many thanks for you work in making these films ,oh Happy Birthday to chevy for October hope you have a great one.I was thinking the other day and i thought that saying you have made Chritmas Vaction why not make "National Lampoon's New Year's Eve Vacation" or something like that,oh well something to dwell on i suppose once again thanks very much bye for now.
