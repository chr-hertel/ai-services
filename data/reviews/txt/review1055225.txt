I use this film in my composition classes because it perfectly tells a compelling story and contains many issues that pertain to everyone: how does one succeed and how does one know it; does one play for the love of something or does one do it for money; what is loyalty and what is friendship; do groups exist for themselves or are they anarchists, and so on. And the music is pure, lovely, driving rock. I would give it a 10, but it is not quite at the level of a Tolstoy short story, but close. James Remar is marvelous in this brief but memorable film. Kudos to the writer and director and actors and production crew. This film brings up an important issue which is the unavailability of Short live subject films. With so much good stuff around each year, why do I have to rely on cable programs that fill dead time slots. They never advertise these items, and it was with luck I caught Session Man.
