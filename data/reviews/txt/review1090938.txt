rocky 2 is one of the best boxing films of ever.

its hard hitting, slip and hock jabbing glued me to my seat! sly's acting is as good as the rest, Carl weathers anger pays off, if u like boxing, this is the film to watch, its also a drama epic. one of sly's greatest and Talia shires acting is shy and effective. it follows up form rocky, who will win the fight? watch and find out!i loved it, a lot of my friends loved it. you have to watch it, rent it buy it steal it if u must just watch the damn film!its blood effects and punching styles are so believable it looks real and realistic!the dilemma sly has, his wife disliking the fact that rocky wants to fight but she is afraid he will get brain damage!
