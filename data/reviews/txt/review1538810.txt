I have to disagree with the "I hated it" reviews from those who will never forgive Woody Allen for the Mia Farrow debacle, but in my opinion, others who claim that "Hollywood Ending" is another Woody Allen tour de force have also strayed from the mark. The movie started out with a great deal of promise, showcasing some of the ephemeral aspects of the movie biz. Tea Leoni was cute, intelligent, and funny as Val Waxman's ex wife, while Treat Williams as Hal Yeager, the studio head, and George Hamilton as his associate seemed well drawn, as well, especially their frank discussions about Val's has-been status. Further, Val's agent (not sure of the actor's name) delivered one of the flick's more notable performances. The movie built steadily through the scene in the restaurant where Val met with Tea after signing the deal and suddenly began berating her for leaving him to live with Hal. Many comedic possibilities that lay ahead remained to be explored when his attack of hysterical blindness sent the picture in an entirely unexpected direction. I didn't care for it at all the first time I saw it, but tolerated it much better upon a second viewing. I've decided that this is a pretty good movie, with some funny lines and situations, although I think the blindness routine took the story down a notch or two.
