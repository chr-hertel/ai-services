A story about a group of kids from the 60's who live pretty carefree days, except for the occasional monster dog, tobacco experimentation and of course...girls! All they love to do more than anything, is play baseball in the Sandlot, they don't keep score, they just play for fun, except for one boy, Benny(Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez), who's the leader and best ball player around. Doesn't star any real big names, except for James Earl Jones as the mysterious..well..you have to watch. And Dennis Leary in a small role as the narrator boys step-dad. But thats fine because its really all about the kids and their great characters.
