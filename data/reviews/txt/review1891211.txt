I remember vaguely having seen this at the end of summer 2004, i think, and i keep the memory of a nice enough entertainment, either conventional as most Romanian movies are. 

If one gets over the Romanian director's incapacity of conveying a clear message in a compelling way, one can at least enjoy some really funny moments with a few of our best comedians and also a bit of eroticism and black humor, in a parody at horror with a precise target. 

Plus, the social content is clear. The guy definitely tries to take a stance about lack of morals and honesty, but he can't find the means to take it to a significant conclusion.

Sadly it all got lost among the other Romanian films in those awful years when the old dinosaurs were on their way to the gutter.
