Stunning! Stunning... Historically accurate.Beautifully composed. Emotionally satisfying. Brilliantly thought out and presented by Mr. Garcia. Cinematography and music perfectly enhance film's theme. Outstanding casting; Outstanding acting by principals and supporting actors. (Even the easily recognizable faces as Dustin Hoffman and Bill Murray do not distract by their immense celebrity; instead the power of their talents adds to the power of the moments in time presented to us. The Lost City played to a packed theater in Chicago, months after the opening -- with the audience unwilling to leave even as credits rolled. The essence of the drama lingers in the soul long after the theater house lights are again on. To miss this film -- is to really lose something!
