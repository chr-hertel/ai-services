I had to use the English subtitles since my American ear didn't catch all the subtitles of the King's English. Aside from that I have enjoyed watching this film at least a dozen times - always catching subtitles I missed before. It was akin to looking at an exquisite painting again and again - gathering more appreciation each time. All performances were excellent but Maggie Smith's reaction to the cup of coffee being dumped into the lap of Weismann's valet was priceless. Best scene: between Helen Mirrin and Eileen Atkins toward end of film, in Mrs. Wilson's bedroom where she confronts the ultimate loss of her son. Helen's performance went right through the ceiling for me - what a treat. Lance Hauser
