The Rounder is an extra on the DVD "To Be or Not to Be". After watching the main feature I decided to see what this extra was about. Jack Benny was out of character as we know him today but as I watched I became drawn in by the very bizarre story line. Jack plays a sophisticated man who has been out late drinking and enters the wrong home in his tipsy state. He encounters a woman who has also just returned from an evening at a club with her boyfriend that ended up in her breaking up with him. The interaction between Jack and the woman is priceless. It has a number of good laughs as well as a somewhat surreal feel to it. Highly recommended.
