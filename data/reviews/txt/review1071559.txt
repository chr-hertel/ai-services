Ever since i saw this movie i couldn't stop thinking about it. Its so powerful and so moving i didn't want it to stop. Brandon Lee delivers an amazing performance. I dread the day where remakes of the nineties becomes popular because i don't think anyone can ever deliver this kind of feeling and emotion. I also would like to recognize the religious similarities. Eric is Christ and he must take up the biblical quote "Vengence is Mine" and sacrifice himself to save all he loves. And finally to recognize how many unfortunate things occurred during the filming, Brandon Lee's death, the man who drove the screwdriver through his hand and the fires, it seems destined to have failed yet it only seems stronger. Incredible
