Four Christmases will not change the world of comedy, it's certainly not among the funniest movies of this year (such as Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Pineapple Express), but it definitely has more than a few laugh out loud moments. This film does seem to follow a typical PG-13 Reese Witherspoon comedy outline, and, not to mention, the third quarter of the film almost completely falls apart. The first three Christmases are each very original and hilarious in their own way, but the fourth is dull and seems to drag on forever. All criticism aside, Four Christmases is much better than most of the Christmas movies we've seen in the past few years, and will probably be one of the better Christmas movies in the next few upcoming years. Most of the family members have their hilarious scenes (most notably Sissy Spacek and her "taboo" scene), so this is overall a completely watchable comedy that is worth the price of an admission ticket.

-3 out of 4 stars
