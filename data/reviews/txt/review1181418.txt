I am actually surprised that more people did not like the film. I know that it was "low-budget", but a lot of good movies are "low-budget" and are still worth watching. I think the storyline was very fresh and rarely seen: Black gay men living in New York and dealing with life after 30 and there is hope, love and even a few laughs to help you make it through. I think also that it showed the diversity that exists even within the black same-gender loving community. The characters were ones that we were familiar with...or so we thought and then now they are presented in a different light, which makes us think about them, and perhaps ourselves, differently. Honestly, as soon as the movie started and I saw the tell-tell "low-budget" look to the set, I wanted to turn it off, but, I am glad that I gave it a chance and it proved itself worthy.
