I went to see HBII because of the high ratings it was receiving and because I like the character. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. Although HB's character is cool and well played, the supporting characters were too mellow in comparison. The villain wasn't particularly evil either and the golden army was really quite childish I thought. But those things aside, the whole story came off as quite cheesy and misplaced. It does not carry the kind of dark tone that the character deserves. I wouldn't recommend this film, despite it's obviously big budget, action sequences, occasional witty line and feigned attempt at greatness. Thumbs down.
