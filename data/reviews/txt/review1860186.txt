Basically, there is *only* two things really wrong about this movie. They are Uwe Boll and Matthew Lillard. With some really talented people in their place this could very well have been a much more enjoyable film.

The acting is par or above. The effects are well done. And while the story isn't anything new, it's still usable for a fantasy movie like this. 

So with different people behind the camera (and at least in one case in front of) this could have been rated 7. As it is now I only give it 5 (barely acceptable and nothing I recommend).
