The film gets to deliver high points of drama and confrontation and is overall fairly watchable; there are some clich√© the director could do without but the good storyline gets them to fit together. Twists and turns guarantee enough suspense in this piece of jigsaw solving, plus there are some elements of a legal thriller, that make the plot a little bit more complex. Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling are really excellent but the whole cast seems to work properly, both in terms of involvement and rhythm. It's a cut above average thrillers and above stories based upon novels or famous trials, thank to the cast and the screenplay.
