Well... all I have to say is that apart from the nods & tributes to the 1st Supes movies, the comics & cartoons... & the fact I really enjoyed it... I was COMpletely stunned when my extras role in the film (shot over 12 months ago at Kurnell near Sydney - the interior hospital shoots) became a 5+ second on-screen feature! I am the skinny white guy who looks quite surprised at the end of Superman Returns after he is wheeled into hospital from throwing the island of New Krypton into Space. I don't want to blow my own horn here, but... well OK i do! Its probably the ONLY time i'll get a shot on the silver screen - & I am very pleased! :) CHEERS FOLKS!
