Sad to see the Larry Talbot character resurrected in such a ridiculous fashion. This gets "Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man" off to a bad start, although the production certainly looks better, more expensive than "The Wolf Man". Patric Knowles returns, but in a different role (which leads to some confusion); Maria Ouspenskaya is also back as the gravely serious gypsy, though she hasn't much to do. Poor Lon Chaney (Jr.) has to sweat this whole thing out again and, although the transformation scenes are much better this time, the flimsy plot is a house of cards. Leading up to the battle between the monsters, the filmmakers waste time on hoary details and fancy talk. And what about Bela Lugosi as the Frankenstein monster? Eesh! Calling Ed Wood... * from ****
