If Buddy was 13 in the 30's (when the majority of the story took place), he would have been in his 50's in the 70's (when the story was supposed to end). The grown up Buddy who appears at the end of the movie was MAYBE in his early to mid 30's. In reality, he'd have actually been about 20 years older. Other than that, cute movie coming from a Southerner. Usually, Im picky about movies taking place in the South. For example, I hated Julia Roberts fake accent in Steel Magnolias. It irritated me because she IS from the South, and STILL found it necessary to over exaggerate a Southern Accent. Overall, cute movie. Didn't even know it existed until I walked in on my mother watching it. Laura and Diane (real life mother & daughter) are cute in it together.
