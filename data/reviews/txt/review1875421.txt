The story of a girl that caused the dead of his mother when she was a child. That will mark her whole life and her relationships. She lives obsessed by death.

"I am Dina" has a powerful and promising beginning, but as the story advances everything turns a little bit confusing. It looks like a second rate Bronte sisters tale, and it gets much worst as the ending approaches.

Not even that red-head beauty called Maria Bonnevie makes the movie a little more attractive. Boring (big time)

*My rate: 4/10
