I have seen 3 versions of Sweeney Todd: the 2007 movie by Tim Burton, the 1979 version with Angie Lansbury, and this. I became a fan of Sweeney after seeing the wonderfully amazing 2007 version (I WILL review that), and this was the 2nd Sweeney I've seen, and I've never been disappointed yet except for the atrocious camera work in the 1979 version.

Now you guys already know the plot, so I won't give anything away. But anyways, here's my breakdown of some of the cast: GEORGE HEARN as SWEENEY TODD: Awesome!!!!! He was much better than Johnny Depp... and Depp's my favorite actor (Depp did an amazing job in the movie though, keep in mind). I couldn't believe my eyes and ears. His singing is perfect, and so is his acting! PATTI LuPONE as LANDLADY MRS. LOVETT: The best Mrs. Lovett I've seen. She did an amazing job. Throughout she kept me captivated, and I loved it.

NEIL PATRICK HARRIS as TOBEY RAGG: Good performance, especially in "Not While I'm around".

DAVIS GAINES as ANTHONY: Great performance! Especially when he sings "I have sailed the world and seen its wonders...", that's when you know he's awesome from the beginning.

VICTORIA CLARK as the BEGGAR: Great!!!!! I felt like they actually used an actual beggar for her role.

I will leave the rest for you to see, but I was amazed by this Sweeney adaptation. Watch it!
