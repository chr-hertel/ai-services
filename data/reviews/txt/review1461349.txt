I have seen it 6 times times and each time i see something that i miss the last time. It is so real and it keeps your attention and wow it was good. Matthew Perry was excellent in it and the children in it just made so real. I like the rules that he had made for the class and the way he stuck to them too. My daughter liked it when he had to drink the chocolate milk but they did learn. I also like it when he did the teaching of the Presidents that he did it to rap. It just is written so well and i know some of my friends that seen can relate to it as they grew up in that area. I hope that it eventually will come out on DVD as i would own it then.
