The poster above me said, "For this fight, the computer used a ton of attributes for Ali and Marciano, and came up with a decision as to who would be the best fighter ever. To film this fight, they did film the two sparring, despite both fighters already being in retirement (Rocky for many more years than Ali)." 

That is false. When Muhammad Ali retired, Marciano was already DEAD for years. Marciano died in 1969 at the young age of 45. Marciano and Ali shot the footage in 1968-early 1969. Aside from that, the DVD was a very good one, and I think as years go on, many, many, many boxing fans will be adding this one to their collection. I give this DVD production 5 out of 5.
