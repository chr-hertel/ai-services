First thing I have to say is, this movie was completely not what I expected. A movie about a universal remote control...must be lame right? WRONG. As always, Adam Sandler is hilarious, but there's much more to this movie then that. The ending completely takes you off guard. You see the trailers and you think you know what's going to happen, you really don't. The movie has many talented actors in it, not just Sandler, such as...Kate Beckingsale (Underworld), Christopher Walken (Wedding crashers, The Stepford Wives), Sean Astin (50 First Dates, The Lord Of The Rings), etc. The cast is amazing and very well chosen. The cinematography is pretty good, but yes, it could have been better. This movie could be looked at as another one of those hilarious Adam Sandler movies, but the main focus should not be on that...it is simply a great comedy with amazing actors. I loved every last bit of it, and even know some people who cried during it. Go see it, rent it, BUY IT!
