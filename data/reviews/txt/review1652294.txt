I rented this flick because the cover looked interesting, Lionsgate film, how bad could it be....Sure it had a good preview at the beginning....however it was really really bad, the worst so-called "cop" acting I have seen in years. 

No good special effects, The script was horrific, the acting was even worse, I have to ask, was the director on acid when he made this, the writer should never work in Hollywood again. Normally I can watch a bad movie all the way through. I could only watch halfway through, yes I choose to do laundry than finish watching this monstrosity. Don't waste your time or money, if you do, ask for it back!
