*exhales* I just finished this film and it blew my mind.

I bought this movie on the strength of the directing of Paprika and I had no idea what this movie was about. I can come up with only one word: Intense.

The basic plot of Perfect Blue is the main character, Mima, is a successful pop singer who chooses to leave her group and become an actress. But soon after discovering a website that tracks her every move in detail followed by landing a role in a violent television drama, strange things begin to happen all around her. She becomes paranoid and hallucinates about an alternate self who is still a pop singer. Soon reality and dreams merge all leading to a very thrilling finale.

I cannot describe this movie in my words but it is the best movie I've seen in a good long time. I very much recommend it to all who can handle scenes of explicit violence and disturbing images.

10/10. A fantastic psychological drama.

As a side note, the upbeat opening song is a real contrast to the movie itself. I catch myself humming it and I can't help but laugh.
