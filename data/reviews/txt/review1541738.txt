Just saw the film and it was a very well executed narrative of a snapshot of pre-Columbian native life and struggle in Mezoamerica, nothing else. Although dealing with a population of rather scant complexity, Mr. Giibson is able to give a meaningful depth to the characters, without loosing the primitivism of their life. I liked that, it cut off any romanticism or imposed modernism for sake of cinematic embellishment.

The plot is simple, predictable and in times tedious, but the abundance of gore, rainforest persecutions and wild attacks (by animals and warriors alike) keeps the film at good pace. The script is very tight, fast and well executed, leaving no loose ends and even a very interesting mixing of events at the end.

I heard many things about the propensity of Mr. Gibson to expose the viewer to grotesque trauma shots with microscopic detail. Such device offers, in this environment, story and times, a unique appeal that will not be repulsive (as in the Passion of the Christ) because here, both enemy and victim belong to the same circle of life, death, survival and dominion, carefully balanced by the director and masterfully played by the actors.

Highly recommended if you are interested in seeing the primitive aspect of beings without antiseptic story-telling.
