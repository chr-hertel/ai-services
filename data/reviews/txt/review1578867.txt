seriously it's that good. 24 is without doubt the best show to ever grace our TV screens, some will argue against this because certain story lines seem unfeasible- it's TV, dammit it's bad enough we have to put up with the boundaries of reality in real life, now what we watch has to be realistic? For those who have seen it you should know what I'm talking about, for those who haven't, do the following- 1) Go and borrow/buy season 1 and watch all the seasons chronologically otherwise some moments in the more recent seasons will have no impact on you whatsoever 2) Go watch it now, stop going on about "oh, Lost is so great, it's all about these people who are lost and they don't know where they are cos they're lost, it's great cos it goes on for ages but never really gets anywhere" because quite frankly Lost is not good enough to kiss Kiefer Sutherland's backside.
