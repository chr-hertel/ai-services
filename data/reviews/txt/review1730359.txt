We had to wait twelve years after the Die Hard Trilogy but once again has a great action trilogy been made. To anyone who doesn't believe this movie deserves it's Top 250 spot, think of it this way: The Bourne Ultimatum is a representative of the whole trilogy and as the best of the trilogy, deserves it's spot. I truly believe it's unique for a third installment to be better then the first or second one. In fact I would go so far as saying the first one is the worst of the series, even though I love it to death. Matt Damon gets his chance to shine once again and I'm really happy he's finally getting recognition. He's a great actor and a lot of his films are worth seeing. The Bourne Ultimatum is a must for action movie fans. It's the year's best ( of the action genre) even though I enjoyed the controversial Die Hard 4.0 too. 300 rates better on CGI but both Die Hard 4.0 and 300 are seriously lacking intelligence compared to TBU. I hope they don't do a fourth, the trilogy is too legendary already to ruin with an uninspired and unnecessary sequel.

The Bourne Ultimatum is Paul Greengrass' best and I really hope it remains in the top 250 even after the hype passes. Overall impression: phenomenal.
