I don't like this movie, though I am willing to accept John Simon's take: "Obnoxios garbage, but made with a certain panache." The endless sequels should pretty much rule out any serious person taking it too seriously. 

My only reason for weighing in here is to note what only one other poster does: the truly ghastly nature of the rape scene, which I found truly upsetting when I viewed this film as an adolescent. I wonder if it would cause anyone to have the same reaction today.

It might have been that this came out right after "Deliverance" and the idea was too see how far one could get away with pushing these things. Still, to this day, it is to my mind still the ugliest ten minutes or so from any major studio release. I can't believe Hope Lang, not an unknown actress; took the part knowing what She was in for or didn't walk off the set. 

Jeff Goldblum, as far as I know, never talks about it; and tends to list his walk on in "California Split" as his first film. SMART MOVE.
