Ladder 49 is not a very good movie.

Pheonix and Travolta are MY FAVOURITE ACTORS but they failed to prove themselves in this movie.

Its not all their fault though, the direction was rubbish.

At times it is a nice movie to watch, but, 90% of the time it isn't.

I have no problem with people who like this movie. I am not against it. Its just not very good.

So, if you wish, rent or buy the movie, but my advice is not to see it.

Anyone agree with me?

Thankyou...
