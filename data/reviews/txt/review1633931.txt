This is one of those movies I will see again and again. Not enough plot? Who cares? Over-the-top acting and speeches? Bring 'em on! Right wing propaganda? Oh give me a break.

The movie is absolute eye candy, and the theater where I saw it erupted into applause on more than one occasion. Gerard Butler is huge as King Leonides; he finally gets the role he's waiting for (remember Atilla the Hun? Timeline? Reign of Fire? Didn't think so.) I admit there are many historical inaccuracies, but if I want a history lesson I'll go to a class or watch the History Channel. When I go to the movies, I expect to be entertained. And boy, was I ever!
