if this isn't one of the best psychological thrillers i don't know what is...It left me gasping for air and wanting more all in one, the ending was so twisted that i didn't even see the clues deeply embedded in the film! Was fantastic to see more the the sadistic Jigsaw, Tobin Bell really made the role his own! I can't wait for Saw 3! This is probably one of the best sequels i've seen, they way it incorporated the original into the movie is brilliant! Rise n Shine everyone....There was enough blood to satisfy even the most hardcore terror/horror film fan! One particular scene left me almost crying in fear and anguish due to it's horrific nature! here's a hint...it involves Amanda and her sordid past!

Rise n Shine people...Jigsaw wants to play a game!
