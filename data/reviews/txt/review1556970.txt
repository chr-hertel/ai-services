I first watched this movie back when it was first released on VHS (I think) as a Christmas gift from my uncle in Japan. I remember liking it but I rewatched it again just a couple of days ago... and wow. I was totally blown away.

There is definitely more than meets the eye in this wonderfully told story. I don't want to give anything away so I won't say much about it, but there is so much depth in this movie and the messages (such as striving for a goal and the difficulties of it) are just so brilliantly told through the characters and events.

Furthermore, the environment completely captured the now decreasing atmosphere of tranquility and peacefulness of suburban Japan back in the 80s to the mid 90s. After the movie was over, I couldn't turn it off and had to watch it through to the credits. I was totally taken back by the wonderful environment created by this movie.

I can't tell you how much I appreciate this movie enough. All I can say is: If you haven't seen this movie, you should DEFINITELY check it out.
