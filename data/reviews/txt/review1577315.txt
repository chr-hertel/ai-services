What a moving experience watching this movie. You get a great idea of the troubles Northern Ireland went through, and how it affected England itself and Northern Ireland as well.

You also get a glimpse of how it affected families of the dead and what they had to go through just to get recognition for these bombings. 

Gerard McSorley was superb in this film. It was almost surreal how good this man was in this film. 

Overall, this had to be the greatest film I have ever seen. And I was only 14 when I saw this film (15 at this moment) and I'm still touched by this movie.

I recommend this movie to everyone not only interested in Northern Ireland and the troubles, but for someone who wants to see a moving, touching, and amazing movie.
