Okay, to start with i saw this movie thrice cause i loved everything about this movie.

This movie rotates around a boy named Ishan,who has a very creative mind, but has a problem in reading and writing ,due to which his parents will send him to a boarding school thinking that he is acting 'brat' knowingly. Later on Ram (Amir Khan), comes as a temporary art teacher and finds that Ishan has got a problem called Dyslexia and helps him to over come it.

And please...this movie is not only for children's. It's an awesome movie.Two thumbs up for Taare Zameen Par
