Steven Spielberg has just scored another triumph following War of the Worlds which was a huge box office smash! Eric Bana is so lucky to work with Steven along with many of the other actors including the always talented Gefforey Rush who was remarkable as the case officer. A true piece of world history brought to life by one of the most influencle filmmakers of all time! It is brilliantly shot with good use of archival footage of the real Munich event. The cast was so into the world around them as if they were actually experiancing it for themselves. The score was chilling. John Williams made a good use of a singer making the score more effective than some of his other works. The film was a fantastic piece of history brought to life!
