Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973) follows the last days of the notorious Billy the Kid (Kris Kristofersen) and his former running buddy Pat Garrett's (James Coburn) attempts to bring him to justice. A film that show's how true friendship and honor can blur the lines of justice. Despite his outlaw status, Billy the Kid was well liked by the common folk whilst Pat Garrett was widely viewed as a traitor and back stabbing turncoat by his peers. Many people don't know that they were once the best of friends until the local and state government made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

To describe the movie would be an injustice. Simply out, Sam Peckinpah poured a lot of himself into this film. Many of his regulars appear in the movie. The studios made him take on Bob Dylan (to bring in the young folks) and to cast Kris Kristofersen in the lead as Billy the Kid (despite being too old for the part). That's the main reason for this film not receiving a ten. But to my surprise Mr. Kristofersen did a decent job in bringing the mythical outlaw to life. If you enjoyed THE WILD BUNCH, you'll love PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID. Unofficially remade as YOUNG GUNS II.

Highly recommended.
