This is a great episode. It starts with a ladies night in the jock, not that there were many ladies in the Jockey for the night, but Fiona notices somebody who she fancies, but wakes up the next morning with a surprise when she sees who's lying next to her. Also Ian realises that he has a different blood group to the rest of the family which means his father may not be who he think it is. Also the Gallagher's get a visit from the social services after Liam has an accident. There are hugely funny scenes in this episode especially the fantastically funny speech from Frank Gallagher (David Threlfall) at the end of the show about Fiona loving here youngest brother Liam. This is a fantastic episode from a fantastic show and i am one of many fans who like this show. This show is one of the most liked shows in the area where i live as the show represents the antics and the lifestyle of the local people, although the Shameless characters take every situation to the extreme and i find it interesting to watch as people who i see as regular doing crazy and wild things.
