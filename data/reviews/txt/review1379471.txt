A fantastic film. Gísli Halldórsson gives a great performance as always and really gives the movie a lot.

It is a very beautiful film where the main contrast is not on spoken word but on what the eye sees and that is what makes this movie work not only in Iceland but worldwide. There is not word spoken for the first 20 minutes of the films and by then the viewer doesn't really care if the film is in Icelandic or in English or what ever other language.

The movie clearly shows that you don't need to be 20 years old to be in love and how some people are simply children of nature

One of the best films i have seen. 10/10
