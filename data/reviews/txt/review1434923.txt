The joint Polish-Soviet film had to be something very funny and fresh. Indeed, the very theme seems to be very promising - 1923, a police informer runs from Chicago to the Soviet city Odessa, that lies at the Black Sea coast, then, the killer is sent to murder him. This hapless killer, played by the great Jerzy Stuhr, is met with the strangling Soviet hospitality, he is mistaken with the famous scientist, he is in the series of the extremely funny gags, and finally he fails to commit his job. The play of the Russian film stars is also great - Nikolay Karachentsov plays a mafia bootlegger, and the untimely demised Viktor Stepanov plays a noisy Ukrainian farmer, also, the small role of Cesare Pazura as a German bicyclist is also great. But in general, the film is far too long, too banal often and the unnecessary nudity scenes and pointless musical interludes make it a half-hearted job.
