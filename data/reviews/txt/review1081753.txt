So much controversy about this movie. Why? All Mel Gibson did was to follow the bible.... and I can't say for all of the movie, but for many of the scenes he actually used the exact words in the bible. 

I am a Christian and I thought this movie was made with a purpose. I think that the so-much-talked-about violence has a purpose. Mel Gibson uses this violence to emphasize just how much Jesus suffered for us, in an attempt to restore our faith in God. Did anybody think of it from this point of view? And Christians are saying they wouldn't take their kids to this movie. But my question is: would they take their kids to another movie about Jesus, where he is betrayed and then ridiculed and killed on a cross, with less violence? Do kids really understand what happened and why it happened? Do they understand that God sent his son to Earth so that he would die in order to redeem mankind? 

I think that in a world like today where more and more people are losing their faith in God, a movie like this helps us to appreciate even more the sacrifice that God made in order to save us, and helps us to wonder whether or not his sacrifice was worth it, whether we appreciate it as much as we should.

It is a powerful movie and I admit, it was very hard to watch, as a Christian. But any other movie where Jesus is beaten and killed would be as equally hard to watch, or at least it would be for me.

I am not saying I like violence in movies, but if you think about it, there is so much violence in movies for absolutely no purpose, but in this movie there is one.
