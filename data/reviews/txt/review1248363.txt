This is a wonderful black exploitation movie written by the mind that brought you such classics as "Moesha" and "Girlfriends" and "Beauty Shop." Just when you thought Norman Vance Jr. could only get into the minds of beautiful black women, he goes and writes a masterpiece like this - a 70s era film about some mixed up jive turkey kids, dealing with some real issues, keeping it real, staying in school, not talking to strangers, and playing Atari.

Their only way to survive? Rollerskating of course! Oh, and I know what you're thinking: "A teen movie? I'll bet it's super-original and not formulaic!" Well dear friends, you're absolutely right! It's really something.

Sure, none of the actors in this movie are famous any more. And YES, most of the dialog makes you sleepy and consists of phrases like "mother sucker" and "out of sight Lite Brite." And NO, the writer doesn't strive to create likable or realistically motivated characters, but who cares? This is the 70s people! Can you dig? AND this thing has got loads of 70s music! Can you believe it! How did they do that? All that music in one movie? They must have killed some fool for all those groovy tunes.

And on top of that WESLEY JONATHAN, the stereotypical, awful actor who played JAMAL GRANT on NBC's wildly unsuccessful, yet terrible Saturday morning teen drama "City Guys" is IN THIS MOVIE!!!! And he's the sweetest guy in the movie. They even call him "The Sweetness" because he's so sweet.

Go see it. You won't regret it or wish you'd fed your eyeballs to your dogs instead.
