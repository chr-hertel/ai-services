It is a great pleasure to watch,to experience a classic thriller with such a good presentation of characters as this movie has.The plot seems simple but is actually generous and Val Kilmer does a great job along with the whole cast.I must say that soon after the movie started,i've noticed a familiar atmosphere,details,sensations that i've met before,like i was one of the characters,which,of course,made it more interesting and thrilling.David Mamet once again proves his ability and talent in creating excellent thrillers by placing strong,interesting characters in classic subjects,speaking in terms of scripts,plots.As i was watching the film i felt like i knew things that were going to happen,but in a good way,not like being bored or so.That was because i liked Heist as much as this one.The movie is very good,the director completed his task successfully and the cast is well chosen.Take this movie at home and enjoy it!
