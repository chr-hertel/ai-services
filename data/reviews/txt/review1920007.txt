I have seen some terrible movies in my time......This is not one of them!!! Mike Mires is a genius he writes, acts, directs and gets his celebrity friends to join in the fun!!!

One thing i especially liked was the fact nobody was afraid to have fun!! everybody who appeared on film enjoyed themselves!!! Okay there was no deep plot or huge drama, but there is not supposed to be!! its a witty smart comedy that is incredibly light hearted in a world that is so serious. 

Mike Mires says if i can take the laugh at myself i can throw caution to the wind and just be funny!! Just take the movie for what it is and let the humor take over.
