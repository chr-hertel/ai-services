Although I wish the movie had been a little more on the art-house side, I was happy to see the era brought to life with such a marvelously charismatic and captivating assortment of actors (Jeffrey Wright was more than solid, but the beautiful Eamonn Walker as Howlin Wolf was my favorite, after the beautiful Brody). Not enough has been said about female director Darnell Martin, who, like Etta James, is a very fair-skinned woman of African descent. It's likely she can appreciate Etta's confused position as a mixed-race woman in the mid-20th century. Martin's foregrounding of the position of the women characters, whose own pain, ambition and insecurity had to take a back seat to the pain, ambition and insecurity of their men, was for me the real core of the picture. Wright and Gabrielle Union, as well as Brody and Beyonce, are at their best when conveying how romantic love is so often frustrated, both by gender and by racial power plays.
