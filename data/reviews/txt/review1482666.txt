In the history of remakes (or at least the few dozens I've seen), this is a rare one that is superior to the original. FYI My (very short) list goes like this:

1. Nosferatu (Herzog, 1979)

2. Manchurian Candidate (Demme, 2004)

3. Three's Company (1977 remake of the British sitcom "Man About the House")

Every other remake I've ever seen has stunk. I watched this film expecting it to stink as well, but I was pleasantly surprised. A lot of loose ends, present in the original, were wrapped up neatly in this version. A lot of the plot made more logical sense. The modern context is much more digestible than the standard "faceless Russian commie threat" of the original. The acting of Denzel Washington is superior to that of Frank Sinatra. And although Meryl Streep's portrayal is not quite as chilling as Angela Lansbury's, it's much more believable and practical.

Unless you enter into this movie with a total fanatical prejudice against remakes (which we all have to a certain degree), you will enjoy this film.
