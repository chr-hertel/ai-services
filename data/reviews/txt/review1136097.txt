Simple murder mystery told in a conventional way. Every actress gets several possibilities to tell her side of the story, information is compared and the story evolves. Of course there is a final twist (as there always is in these movies).

But Fran√ßois Ozon sets this up as a combination of comedy and musical; the mystery element serves only as a vehicle for that. Only Huppert, excellent as ever, is really funny and over-the-top, the rest almost has no clue where Ozon wants the movie to go. So it is all still entertaining, but also very traditional French fare. Ozon's direction is straightforward; no fancy camera-work here. In the beginning there is a flower for every character on the opening credits, telling something about that character. But for the deeper meaning: all beautiful women are lying here, the truth has severe consequences for men. To balance this men-friendly view the lesbian parts and incest are thrown in.

As some actresses have terrible voices and every actress has a musical segment, it is sometimes a bit annoying. Catherine Deneuve seems to particularly like the musical genre, as she already once did Les parapluies de Cherbourg and Les demoiselles de Rochefort, and recently did Dancer in the Dark.

If you want to see a movie, but dislike cinema, this is for you.
