Three sheets is the best show that no one without access to HDTV has ever heard of. Zane Lamprey brings a level of dignity and humor to drunkenness that hasn't been seen since, dare I say it: Dean Martin. The Belgium episode is a must-see for any beer geek (like myself) and every episode provides you with an opportunity to drink, learn, be merry, and root Zane on as he journeys through yet another fascinating locale. He gets sauced, banters, zings, and even disturbs, but damn if he isn't the most likable guy you'll ever see on television. You'll never find a better drinking buddy. So grab a drink, get Steve McKenna'd, and enjoy!
