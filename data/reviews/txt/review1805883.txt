'Children of Men' paints an interesting, detailed, and realistic backdrop. This should be said from the start, because in fact, the film does little else. Having created an reasonably realistic and viable starting scenario, the film contrives, in rather obvious fashion, to drag a small cast over that backdrop, permitting the camera to pick up every detail. The acting of the cast, as it poses with the backdrop, is often, if not universally superb, and if a bit of acting, and that marvelous backdrop are all that you require, the film is a great one. The problem is, that the plot is altogether lacking and incomplete. It is a rare episode in a television show or movie of any sort that does not have more story to it than this film. The lack of plot also reveals a deep and fundamental lack of meaning in the thoughts behind this movie. There is a distilled European angst, a pure and saccharine sentimentality, dribbles of ill conceived piety, and little else.

Rather than using an altered environment to enhance the message, 'Children of Men' uses a novel environment to replace making a considered statement and confronting ideas directly. This puts 'Children of Men' at odds with both Science Fiction, and quality film.
