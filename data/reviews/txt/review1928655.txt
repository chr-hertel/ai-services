If many young girls out there love this show and the star well heres a wake up call for you. In 1998 Disney made the Chinese Folktale into a movie. Basically this is imitating the great film into a modern day drama for tween. Miley Cyrus can't act and has a poor background on the character. The supporting characters have terrible and unsupported feedback to Miley's character. Somehow when Disney Channel thought that this show was good as Even Stevens, Lizzie McGuire, The Jersey, So Weird, and The Famous Jett Jackson they were wrong. Disney Channel makes terrible investments and this will surely backfire as a result of the declining fans the Miley soon will loose in the future. In conclusion don't watch this show if you love Billy Ray Cyrus.
