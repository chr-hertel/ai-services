The French have a great reputation for cop films but this is the best yet.

Fast paced, well scripted, excellent characters and dark deeds all combine to produce an engrossing film. Of course the main thread is the past and current relationship between the two rivals. The latter only hinted at later in the film.

But even apart from the protagonists, it is the diverse range of characters and their interaction that gives the film the depth it so well deserves.

It has just been cinema (Dec 2005) released in Australia and only to those few remaining Art House theaters. Go see it and if it's not showing near you, but it on DVD. It's a keeper.
