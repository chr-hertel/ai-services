I just saw Summer Palace last night in San Francisco and I was blown away. I spent the entire night thinking about the film and significance of the message it sent. I don't want to spoil anything, you just have to see it and be prepared to think about it for a long time. I can't wait for my wife to see it, so we can discuss it. I didn't want to see it at first but after I read the review in the Chronicle saying that it was the greatest film to come out of China, well I guess I felt I had to see it and I am so glad that I did. Some people might find it slow, but that is life right? Sometimes it is slow and sometimes it moves so quickly is passes you by and only later to find the real message the director was trying to deliver. It is as though there are five different stories going on with just one character. I know that doesn't make sense but when you see it, you will understand. I highly recommend it.
