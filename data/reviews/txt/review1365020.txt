I loved this movie! I saw it Summer 2005 at the Gloria Film Festival where it won the audience favorite award. I would love to see it again but it looks like they don't have a distributor yet. Please release this movie in theaters!!!!!!! I would pay to see it again and I'd get my friends to go and they'd get their friends to go and their friends.... Not to mention DVD sales. It's a keeper, if only I could get it.

The real-life testimonials in the movie were awesome. The storyline is funny. The actors do a great job.

See it if you get the chance. It's worth it.
