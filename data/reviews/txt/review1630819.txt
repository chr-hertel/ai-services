The first chapter in the Hannibal Lecter saga, it's also an early indication of Michael Mann's impressive skill as a director. The film is expertly crafted and very stylish, which makes up for the story and acting flaws. And there are quite a few. While I think this is definitely better directed than Red Dragon - not surprising, given the two directors involved - it is not nearly as well-written or as well-acted. William Petersen is the lone bright spot, as he's the only one from the cast better than their Dragon counterpart; he delivers an effective and sympathetic performance. Brian Cox is solid as Lecter (spelled Lecktor in this one) but he's nowhere near Hopkins' iconic character, and Tom Noonan is creepy but underused as Dolarhyde. This one deviates more from the book to take creative license, and that lowers it, in my eyes, though the climax - with "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" - is excellent. A solid addition to the franchise, but it's bested by Red Dragon.
