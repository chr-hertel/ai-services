My 10/10 rating assumes that you're the type who's decided that you like "Teenagers from Outer Space" before watching it. It portrays an alien race coming to earth to let their lobster monsters grow and devour all humans. As an example of what these aliens are like, they have disintegrating guns that can turn you into a skeleton in the time that it takes to blink. But, one of the aliens named Derek (David Love) decides that he doesn't like their plans and escapes. Most of the rest of the movie has another alien looking for Derek while the latter hides out with human Betty Morgan (Dawn Anderson) and her grandfather.

Yeah, it sounds like your average '50s B-movie, but it's still really neat. One of the many movies that truly makes one nostalgic for the era when one could go to the drive-in and see these sorts of flicks, mainly because Betty was kinda hot (well, duh; it seems like all the women in these B-movies were). And I don't think that the aliens were actually teenagers.

Still, I can't quite figure out: why would an alien be named Derek?
