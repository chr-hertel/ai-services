If I never read the book, I suppose I'd grade it a point higher. But I was, for the most part disappointed. The entire mystique of the text is the relationship of Humans with their Daemons. The reason millions continued reading the next 2 books in the series was the human/daemon devotion to one another. It's the heart and soul of the entire trilogy, and it's NOT the central focal point in the movie. It's barely mentioned. The chronology is inexplicably altered in the film as well. Why can't Hollywood co-opt novels in an intelligent way? Did they learn nothing from "Lord Of The Rings"? Any fan of those books will tell you that Peter Jackson's adaptation was so utterly clever in it's adherence to the 'IT' factor of the text. Hollywood truly believes the masses are fools, mouth breathing, move-their- lips- while-they're-reading fools. They must, otherwise 'Compass' might have retained more than a fifth of the novels luster. If you haven't read the book, then my review is lost on you, and all I can suggest to you is to read it, or buy the audiobook on iTunes(my new favorite medium for fantasy novels such as this and the Potter books) Those who HAVE read it I'm sure will agree with me once they've seen the film. Bear fight rocked, but it was too short. Overall, it's just another NICE movie about a little kid with a grand destiny. AND without spoiling anything, The film ended about 30 pages shy of the books ending. Those not in the know have no clue what they are really missing.
