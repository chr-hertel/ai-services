The movie achieved it's goal, at least if you've looked over some of the comments here! The Yanks are furious, they call it a lie and propaganda. They are so brainwashed by they're so called "free media" (read - owned by the rich moguls close to the federal government) that seeing a different aspect of "The Great US Iraq crusade" is making them angry. But - at least - it plants a seed of doubt of their own government's intentions and actions abroad. So the movie has already achieved it's goal - made the people think and doubt the official propaganda that Bush's administration feeds to them.

To say a few words about the movie itself - well, it's definitely NOT a masterpiece of the cinema. But it's provocative and brave - that is more than enough.

Way to go, Turks! 10 points to you!
