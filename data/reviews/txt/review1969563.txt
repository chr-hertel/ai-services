dexter is the best show that i enjoy watching all the time, its great that the they decided to do season 3 which so far is awesome i cant wait to find out what happens and i hope (as long as he doesn't get caught) that they continue to a season 4 and beyond because it is brilliant. the choice to use M.C.Hall was fantastic as he really plays the character well and is believable instead of using some over paid actor who would not be as good, he really fits the look of the character and plays both roles well in the show as a killer, cop and boyfriend/husband. the show is really well planned and thought through as the story lines follow through and nothing is missed to ensure that the audience doesn't get lost in whats happening and one last thing when dexter talks to him self in his head that is fantastic, when he stares at someone and he saying in his mind that he wan'ts to kill them while engaging in polite conversation, absolutely amazing.
