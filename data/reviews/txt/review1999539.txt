Aamir Khan is alright but the director does not do any justice to him.

Asin is really a sin on this movie. OK at times and irritating during others Jia Khan is unnoticeable.

Songs are just randomly strewn and not good.

Movie is just too long. Typical, steal the idea from Mememto but thrown in enough masala & the occasional international location to make it a commercial bollywood flick.

It's a Hindi movie but has a very over-acting South Indian touch which again is coming from the director A nice story was wasted with the usual bollywood drama and horrible direction.
