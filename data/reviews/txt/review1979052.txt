I'm sitting here reading these posted reviews for this movie and thinking to myself either all these reviewers are over 80 years old or they are wound so tight they squeak when they walk....or both. The movie is FUN...it's STUPID COMEDY...just because every movie isn't Ben Hur or The Godfather doesn't make it total junk. If someone is going to read the reviews of this movie, then odds are they know what this movie is about. And they don't need to hear what a bunch of square eggs say about it, either. It would be tantamount to asking a bunch of 18-year-olds writing a review on the silent film "The Birth of a Nation". In my opinion, any review giving a movie less than 5 stars must've been written by someone not appreciating what the movie is all about (and should be discarded). In other words, people who shouldn't have watched the movie in the first place. Maybe every movie theater should ALWAYS have Driving Miss Daisy available to these people just in case they may be "forced" to watch something different. That being said, I loved Date Movie, Superhero Movie, and a whole list of other stupid comedy movies and I don't think this movie was that bad...though not that great, either. If you liked Meet the Spartans, you'll like this one. It is pretty fast-paced and there are some funny parts you'll remember. I really would give this movie a 6 or 7, but I'm upping it to an 8 because I don't think a 1.3 rating is fair AT ALL.

Hope this helps someone.
