"Polo Joe" was a vehicle for Joe E. Brown. This 1936 Warner Bros. comedy has some funny moments and it's always a pleasure to see Mr. Brown in anything. As directed by William McGann, the movie has some funny moments.

Joe Bolton (Joe E. Brown), a wealthy man has just returned from China. He is trying to settle down in a community where the game of polo is the sport to play among the rich people of the area. Joe wants to make Mary Hilton (Carol Hughes) be interested in him. How to go about it? Polo, that's how! The only thing is Bolton is allergic to horses. Any time he is near them he starts sneezing. There is a great sequence that involves Bolton practicing with a little donkey that his valet, Heywood (Charles "Skeets" Gallagher)brings into one of the rooms of Aunt Minnie's mansion. The results are hysterical.

Joe E. Brown proves he was an actor capable to the viewer laugh. The supporting cast is excellent.
