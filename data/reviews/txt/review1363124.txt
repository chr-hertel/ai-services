I have no idea why Zasu 'n' Thelma are listed as "cameos" -- they're the stars of the film! This was their 12th short subject together, released shortly after ALUM AND EVE in late 1932. They're door-to-door salesgirls who are unsuccessful selling to housewives, so they head downtown to sell to their husbands. Inside City Hall, they have several run-ins with a cranky judge and his bodyguard (frequent Three Stooges foils James Morton and Bud Jameson) and Charley Hall. A mediocre entry in the series, but there's some pretty good slapstick, particularly when Zasu (pronounced "ZAY-SOO"; most folks pronounce it incorrectly these days) gets tangled up in a ladder.
