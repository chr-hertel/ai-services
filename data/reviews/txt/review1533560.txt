It is one of the best things I've ever done...seeing this movie changed my being. Since 1/28/2006, the day I walked, for the first time, into that darkened theatre to view this masterfully crafted model of the lives of so many of my glbt family, I've loved harder, laughed louder, cried deeper, and lived fulfilled. - The mourning process overtook me almost immediately, but I was able to wade through the pain. I found my coping mechanism in fan sites and fan fiction, where others, just like me, tortured and wrenched by what was experienced on that mountain, were able to discuss what they felt, how it left them, and what was to come in their lives. Beautifully written stories were crafted using alternate universes, that enabled many to live, in our minds and hearts, what could have been...what should have been. - I am forever grateful to AP, AL, DO, LM, and most especially JG and HL, for bringing the rough, grit, blood, bone, wet, heat and passion to those of us willing to be fed. Simply put...painfully amazing. - KLJ
