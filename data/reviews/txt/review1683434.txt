Considering it's the pilot episode for PLCL the writers don't waste time setting up the Parker Lewis world. Right from the get go you see Parker's jack of all trades tendencies. Parker shows his video editing skills, his technological savvy (his auto-opening locker, compact monitors, buzzer to help Mikey cheat on a test, etc), ticket salesman, and keen ability to weasel his way through any situation. Mikey is a little different in this episode as he normally is suave with the ladies whereas here he requires Parker's assistance. Shelley shows her face as the evil sister out for her brothers destruction and Kubiac threatens to do the destructing of Parker. Milla Jovovich makes an appearance as the love interest (looking faaaantastic at that). I'd definitely recommend that if you're going to watch PLCL for the first time, or if you haven't seen it since the early 90's then you should watch this episode first.
