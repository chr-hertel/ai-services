"Over the Hedge" is surely a very entertaining animation for both - children and adults. I'd say that this is probably one of the best animations from big production companies alongside with Ice Age, Shrek, Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo. They've done a great job animating those animals. The characters are all adorable (very true to like fur and thorns + extremely big blue and emotional eyes). Movie gives a lot of true laughs. Little ones giggled over the cinema. This movie also teaches what truly matters in this life. I also noticed that children liked the musical score. Some of them started to clap their hands silently and hopped on their seats. And I truly liked the voiceovers. Very well and wisely chosen cast. Outstanding performances from Bruce Willis (RJ) and Steve Carell (Hammy). Overall rating - 9/10
