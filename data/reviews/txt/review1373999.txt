The Fog is, at times a very creepy chiller from John Carpenter (Halloween).

The residents of Antonio Bay are preparing to celebrate the town's centenary. But a strange fog comes to town and spoils things. Contained within this fog are the ghostly, seaweed infested corpses of sailors who have come to get revenge concerning events exactly 100 years ago. They kill several people, including some fishermen on a trawler out at sea, a meteorologist and child minder Mrs Kobritz. Other strange things also happen, including a piece of drift wood found by KAB Radio operator's son Andy Wayne. His mum, Stevie broadcasts KAB from a remote lighthouse. She also nearly becomes one of the victims.

The fog is very creepy throughout, especially the situation of the KAB lighthouse and John Carpenter's eerie music.

The excellent cast includes mum and daughter scream queens Janet Leigh (Psycho) and Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween). Also, Adrienne Barbeau as Stevie, John Houseman and Hal Halbrook. With Lee Curtis's Halloween co-stars Nancy Loomis and Charles Cyphers.

For a good scare one evening, watch The Fog. Excellent.

Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
