I mean I guess parts of it were cheesy, but don't go into the movie thinking it's the next best horror flick. It's not. You should however go into it thinking it's going to be an action flick with Samuel Jackson, and some cheesy lines. I mean people who don't like this movie are either immature, or just don't like good movies. I agree with jawschelch there is nothing wrong with this movie at all. Give it a shot, I did and I am not disappointed. Not a 10/10, or a 9/10, but if you don't think this is at least a 5/10 pull your head out of your a@# and get a life. I just think that people lately don't have good taste in movies and need to open up a little.
