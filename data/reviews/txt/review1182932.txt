First of all I think this movie is outstanding from beginning to end. I went to see this movie last night, I never knew anything about it, and I'm glad I didn't since I hate watching trailers, and listening/reading to others opinions on a movie before I see it.

This movie isn't your typical gangster movie, it's more of a psychological movie. Great storyline. Some of you might predict what happens, but personally I force myself not to think what could happen in the movie, I think it ruins the whole experience.

The acting is excellent. Probably the best acting I've seen from Jason Stratham yet. And the performances by Ray Liotta, Andre Benjamin and Vincent Pastore were superb, as were the rest of the actors.

Overall the movie is brilliant, I'd definitely recommend this movie to anyone, if you get the chance it's worth a watch!
