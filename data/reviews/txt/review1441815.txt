I just saw this movie last night for the 2nd time. 

I only subjected myself to watching it again was for my husband who just read the book.

I have read a lot of the reviews and it seems that not many have read the book. Don't let this awful movie keep you from reading a detailed, organized, really good sci-fi book!

The only thing this movie has in common with the book is:

1. Some of the names. 2. The fact a kid leaves his village and gets caught by some aliens.

I am tired of people making movies-from-books and totally screwing them up - and BE has to be the worst of all time.

If you read the book you can gag while you watch, and if you haven't... well maybe you can sit through the whole thing.
