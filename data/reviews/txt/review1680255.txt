The demon worms are gross, the female characters are annoying and obnoxious, and the movie is very clich√©d, but it is a masterpiece, and it's hard to say otherwise.

The environmental message is very powerful!

They did a great job of getting their message across without it being too overbearing. They also made it engaging while at the same time teaching a lesson about humans and nature living in harmony. People who don't like the Anime genre, will still find this a worthwhile movie to watch. I think this film can appeal to children and adults since it holds elements for both.
