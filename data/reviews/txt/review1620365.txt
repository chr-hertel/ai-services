Halfway Home is Surprisingly funny. Only in my opinion did i think this show to be a failure. The way the shows on comedy central are pre-introduced before they air actually aggrivates me. very annoying.

The camera work .. i don't like, it would be nice to be more "COPS"ish. Something as in the camera breaking from angle to angle a lot less. Which, possibly the actors on the show do most of the scenes in one take. It doesn't really matter. It would be cool, but thats just me, being very unimportantly picky.

After watching the first episode, i find it very funny, and very much worth my time, and from thinking it was going to be a very bad show, i now insert my foot into my mouth

9/10
