this is absolutely awful. I heard that Carry on Emmanuelle was the worst of the series, but this really is. I bought this and started watching it four times then turned it off...only watched it fully the fifth time around, it's really that bad.

Joan Sims looks bloated and old, Kenneth Connor's not the little bloke with humorous quirks that we know and love him for in the series...there's nothing in here that actually works. There's no gags that are humorous.

There's a hugely embarrassing scene where there's a soldier blinking heavily....and Kenneth Connor asks him 'why he's blinking'. The gag commences for a minute 'why are you blinking?' 'no I'm blinking not' 'yes you blinking are'....That unfortunately is the level of humour used in this awful film.

You can see them trying to go back to Carry on Sergeant...but that's like trying to find Debbie Harry attractive when she's an eighty year old pensioner based on 'how she used to be'. 

Kenneth Connor in his first lead role for the Carry on's deserved better than this. Patrick Mower is not carry on material.

avoid.
