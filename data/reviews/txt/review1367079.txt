"Captain Ron" was shown on cable recently. Not having seen it, and having no clue what was all about, we decided to take a look. The film was targeted for a young age group, and it's obvious that type of viewer will have a great time with the adventures of this family and the inane captain they have hired to bring them from the island of St. Pomme de Terre, in the Caribbean, to Miami, where they intend to sell the relic for an obscene amount of money.

Well, things don't go the way Martin Harvey planned. When he gets to see the old boat he has inherited, he and the family are shocked. They decide to take a chance with a man who calls himself Captain Ron, to take them on the sea voyage back home. Of course, the Harveys got a lot more than what they bargained for.

The film has some funny moments as directed by Thom Eberhardt. By casting Martin Short, as the somewhat straight laced Harvey, goes against type, because he is usually the funny man. Instead, they let that go to Kurt Russell, who as Captain Ron, has some surprises for the family, and for us. Mary Kay Place plays the mother and Benjamin Salisbury and Meadow Sisto are seen as the Harvey children.

Going to the film with no expectations will, perhaps, work better than having preconceived ideas. This is a film that children of all ages will have a good time.
