another silver star production from the Philippines, with Richard Harrison who have no time to act(admitting he can) in this short (less than 80 min)and pitifully "Death Wish" Rip-off,where He must avenge a rape/murder attack on his son and his girlfriend by a bunch of armed thugs.So he put his best red jogging suit(from Lee major bionic time)and kill a lot of people.Simple story with really nothing new in sight.Made by Terry Page and starring also the usual Mike Monty, James Gaines and Ann Milhench. Only Doris Wishman fans could appreciate this one, I'm one of them but it's not funny enough to have great redeeming value.Not worth seeking, but watchable in the good state of mind with few friends if you find it cheap.
