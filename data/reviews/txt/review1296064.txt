With so many award shows around now you'd be forgiven for wondering why there isn't a 'British Award Show Awards'. It would be more fun than 'The British Soap Awards', an annual nightmare in which the worst programmes on British television battle it out for trophies which, rather appropriately, are made of plastic. The problem is that the soaps look and sound alike, with wobbly sets, lousy scripts, bad music and acting that makes the cast of 'Thunderbirds' look good. They have one storyline between them, which they flog to death, namely the adulterous affair. Have you noticed how nobody ever dies of old age in these shows? What criteria do the judges use to pick the winners? Does someone put on a blindfold and stick a pin in a list of the nominees? How nice it would be if one of the winners used his/her acceptance speech to denounce the genre as 'utter crap'! Whatever next? 'The British Dustbin Awards'?
