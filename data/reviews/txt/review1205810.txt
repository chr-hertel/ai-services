We watched this film with my college here in leicester at the phoenix theatre, it wasn't a surprise to me to discover that Mike Leigh has done it again! after watching secrets and lies by the same director I didn't think there could be a film that was even more depressing and boring I WAS WRONG. Thank you for wasting 2 hours and 5 minutes of my life. I should have learnt my lesson.

There was too much crying and not enough action, at times i wanted to shout "get the hell on with it!" I think the way the director constructs his films is quite unique and commendable (with the actors doing much improvisation) but COME ON! make some happier films because one more like that and i just might jump off a cliff.

Unless your into illegal abortion in the 1950's and a lot of crying and disappointment, give this one a miss.
