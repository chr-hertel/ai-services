The Family Stone features an all-star cast of some of my personal favorites, each of them in a role with a more complicated back story than the last. Observe the role of Meredith Morton (Sarah Jessica Parker), the workaholic, conservative, socially awkward, controlling but sensitive and caring business woman. The character development for all the roles was virtually non-existent, and when development did occur it was only in split-second changes that left the viewer wondering "How'd that happen?" Not only do you come in to this movie feeling like you must have missed the first half, but the multi-plots continue throughout (I kept rewinding it, wondering if I had missed a scene or conversation that would lead into the scene I was watching), making you feel as if you are being bludgeoned with the plot, instead of being swept along with it.

This movie needed to be at least six hours long to properly develop everything that's going on - Maybe they could remake it as a miniseries? - but in only 103 minutes, The Family Stone is doomed to disappoint.
