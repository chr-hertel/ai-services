omg, i totally did not like this movie EVEN ONE BIT it as truly AWFUL, it is so good to go see a movie where you can just turn your b rain off and just laugh but you do not even get that with this terrible movie, my friends and I all HATED it.

The only funny thing was the shark scene but that was just one little piece out of an entire whole movie. But that part was pretty good, but also they gave it away in the preview so you totally knew it was coming so it was not a truly big huge laugh.

Luke Wilson is hot but that is not a good enough reason to spend your money to watch this.

Terrible movie!
