I liked this movie. 

I remember watching this as a little kid with my mom and really believing that it was all real.

It's a real shame this movie isn't played that often anymore. 

It's a light-hearted Christmas movie that serves its purpose, to make children believe in Santa and everything Christmas!

Art Carney was great at playing Santa and the set was adorable!

I loved Jaclyn Smith's character! 

She, as always, looked beautiful.

That woman can't age!
