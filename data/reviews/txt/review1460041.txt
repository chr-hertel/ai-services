When my friends forced me to watch the 1st episode, i was like "damn, lets do something else rather than watching a movie" 

After watching the 1st episode, i was like "put the 2nd one, put the 2nd one, quick.. what are u waiting for?"

Now i wish i wouldn't watch those episodes, so that i could watch them with the excitement of a child...

Once u start to watch a part of any episode, u cant give up watching the rest, until u fall asleep. It's a really thought-provoking movie, that makes u addicted..You cant get your eyes off the screen because action clues are everywhere. and There are so many scenes that u have to watch over and over again to get any idea of the main questions...

Everyday i meet with some of my friends and these days our main issue is "Lost".. We discuss about the details,theories and and characters.

The quality of the movie is also excellent. You can find yourself inside the movie while watching and the director really gives u that feeling. 

Thats the best TV-series that i have ever seen.
