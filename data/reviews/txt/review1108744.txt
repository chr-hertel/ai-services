I like films that have no pretension. Most films today have an 'artificial flavoring' added, but 'Gone's way different. I rented 'Gone' at Blockbuster and was truly impressed with the story.

Yes, the movie is based on the Book of Revelations, but so what? The new CBS series is based on 'Revelations', too. But 'Gone' was first and is definitely the most original of all the last days-type stories.

The acting could definitely be better and it's puzzling why the 'Survivor' guys were cast. The only rational was the type of movie this is which is that the last 'survivor' in the end of the world. Nevertheless, the film was well-directed and written and the locations in Southeast Asia were stellar.

I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who has had a Christian upbringing because it is one searing and emotionally-charged movie that keeps you guessing to the last scene.

Another film I recommend, by the way, is 'Luther' with Joseph Fiennes as the star. I'll write an even lengthier review on that one. Great movie, too.
