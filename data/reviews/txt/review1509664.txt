"Running Scared" is a great film from director/writer Wayne Kramer that shows glimpses of Tony Scott film making and storytelling. The camera work is brilliant and it creates a slick and stylish picture for the movie.

The movie begins with gritty music and comic book credits. The credits may remind you of "The Punisher" or "Hostage," but the premise is entirely different. Joey Gazelle is low on the mob food chain. So when Tommy, his boss's son, kills some corrupt cops, it's up to Joey to dispose of the "hot" weapon.

When young Oleg and Joey's son, Nick, see Joey hiding the gun in the basement, Oleg sneaks the gun home where his depressed mother and his abusive father don't make a quiet home. When shots are heard later, Joey goes to investigate to find that Oleg's father has been shot by the gun that Tommy used to kill the corrupt cop.

Now, with cops, junkies, pimps, the mob, and time running against him, Joey weaves his way through the city to save Oleg's life...and his. This film will not be enjoyed by everybody, but if you enjoy hearing the F-word in every other sentence and don't mind seeing blood and murder, then "Running Scared" is just your movie. With the exception of one scene, this movie is perfect. Elements of Tony Scott are alive and vivid here. Sit back and enjoy the fights.
