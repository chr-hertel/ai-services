Okay. Before I saw this movie, I had read numerous reviews on it. Some said that it was bad. Some said said that it was good. I had to make my own assumption. After seeing it, I can honestly say I loved X-Men The Last Stand. Yes the story was kinda simple and the characters weren't as fleshed out as in the other two X-Men movies, but it was great nonetheless. It did have some other downsides to it. The main one I think was that it didn't follow the comic book closely. But don't be nitpicking the entire movie otherwise you're not going to have a fun time. Just go there and watch the movie. It also left way for maybe a sequel or two (I'm not going to spoil anything. Just watch after the credits). It was a fitting end to this X-men trilogy.
