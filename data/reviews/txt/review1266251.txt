After reading the novel "A Prayer for Owen Meaney" by John Irving, I was wondering why they changed the name of the main character in the film "Simon Birch." After seeing the film the answer was obvious. The author did not want his great novel associated with this mess.

"A Prayer for Owen Meaney" is over 600 pages long and impossible to reduce to a 2 hour movie. This movie is a travesty and an insult to an excellent novel.

The directing and music are strictly television quality. David Strathairn gives a good performance and Ashley Judd lights up the screen in her short role.

Not all great novels can be adapted for the screen. "A Prayer for Owen Meaney" is one of those. This movie does not capture the quality that made the book so special.
