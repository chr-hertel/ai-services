This is an excellent movie. A movie I can actually see with my children and grandchildren without worry. No profanity, no sex scenes. Hollywood take note, great movies are not dependent on shock value. A good story with great acting is what Invincible is all about, and by adding a wonderful moral and lesson of hope makes it an outstanding movie. I would see this movie again. My only complaint is that it ended too soon. Its the best movie of the season. Mark W. played the role of his lifetime, I hope "Oscar" is in his future for this one. It was a punishing role physically, and emotionally it had to be a challenge, and he pulled it off with great success.
