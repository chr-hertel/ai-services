like Paul Cameron i will be also be rushing out to buy this if released on DVD. I've been waxing lyrical about it for years but nobody seems to remember it. I taped it off the TV loaned it to some mate and never saw it again (familiar story !). I Can't add much to Pauls commentary except to reinforce that this film is simply a little gem and its a real shame it's not available. The overlayed stories of the world cup, the rivalry between the two men (football and the lovely lead lady), the coast to coast walk, and Marcos search for the truth about his father make for a really brilliant story. Frankly i would get it just to see the car though - voted most beautiful car of all time apparently. Fingers crossed it may surface again one day- I would love to see it again. steve westwood
