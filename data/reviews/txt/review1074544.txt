For the record, I enjoyed Gladiator. Didn't love, but enjoyed it. This, however, is right up there with Alexander, at times bordering on ridiculous camp. Some of the battle scenes go on and on and I find myself wondering why I am supposed to be invested. Orlando Bloom? Moviestar he ain't. Really. Please. Enough of this waif. A movie like this needs Russell Crowe (the best male lead working today). It's an ambitious quest story and needs an actor of mythical proportions, or at least a very self serious one. Eva Green is pretty, the rest of the cast a waste of screen time even though I enjoyed Jeremy Irons part. Some actors are so great they can even conjure a great part out of nothing. Rent this movie or wait for it to run on TV over and over again.
