THE WEDDING SINGER, in my opinion, is a sweet, charming, hilarious, and heartwarming romantic comedy. If you ask me, the way that Robbie (Adam Sandler) and Julia (Drew Barrymore) met was very romantic. Also, in my opinion, what Linda (Angela Featherstone) did to Robbie on their wedding day was absolutely heartless. In addition, I didn't like Glenn (Matthew Glave) all that much. The music was great, too. Also, watch for a special appearance by Billy Idol near the end of the movie. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, "If you like romantic comedies or movies where people meet by chance, I highly recommend THE WEDDING SINGER!" Now, in conclusion, when you see this sweet, charming, hilarious, and heartwarming romantic comedy, prepare to laugh and be touched.
