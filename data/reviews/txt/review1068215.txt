A jealously possessive husband (Ian Buchanan) finds that his "girl in cotton wool" wife (Jennifer Gatti) is having an affair. He has a contract put out on the mystery boyfriend but the hit is botched and his wife is killed instead. Now he wants both the mystery boyfriend and the hit man deadÂ…but who the "mystery boyfriend" and "hit man" turn out to be....

This film is TV movie quality with a nice twist at the end (50-50 chance you'll guess it). Has some semi graphic sex scenes and a short non-nudity rape sequence.

Ron Perlman has a supporting role as a private investigator with secrets both past and present and he imbues his character with a nice mix of regret and ruthlessness.

Favorite line(s): spoken by the husband to his and his wife's friend: "You would tell me if she were having an affair, wouldn't you?" her reply: "Would I tell her if you were having an affair?"

Worth a rent/buy used.
