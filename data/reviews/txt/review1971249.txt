Batman Begin was and still is the best in the series. I was disappointed in this sequel to begin. The whole movie was pretty dark and depressing. The joker character is kind of weak. I just can't see how batman have such a weak nemesis. It's a movie that tries to provide insight into a mind that is free from the emotional shackle and control of modern society and test the endurance of human character but fell short of what it tried to achieve and in the end felt like the action/plot didn't flow like the previous with numerous boring scenes. I'm not even going to bother providing details as it's disappointing to watch the sequel. Now I have my fingers crossed for the Casino Royale sequel Quantum of Solace. Casino Royale was and is the best Bond yet. I hope Quantum will not disappoint like this one. I am so glad Daniel and Eva are back and I am a fan of Olga who was in the movie Hit-man.
