This is about the bazillionth film I've seen by the Dastoli Brothers lately. It seems this pair have done something rare these days--specialize in making independent shorts. And they have made many--mostly of very good quality. Now it's hard to really review this one very well because the film is only about 2 minutes long! This is short even for one of their films.

The film opens with a guy eating some cereal and he finds a screw in the package. The film then cuts to the factory where it was made and you see that construction is going on all around the place. Later, he's eating a different cereal from a different company, though I won't reveal what happens next.

Entertaining, mildly funny and also mildly gross. It's the sort of film that teens will love and immature adults (like myself) will also get a kick seeing.
