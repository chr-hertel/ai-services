I think that this academy award was one of the best academy awards i have ever seen.The biggest director of all time James Cameron won 3 academy awards for his 11 academy awards winner movie TITANIC and his I'm the king of the world was one of the best memories of the academy awards.god i love that director and all of his movies especially TITANIC.The rest were really good Jack Nichlson.Robin.mat.just great.well i'm sorry LA CONFIDENTAL and GOOD WILL HUNTING for loosing but come on it's TITANIC you were nominated with i don't think you had a chance.congratulations James Horner for receiving the Oscar for best original score and for My Heart Will Go On you are really a great composer you have a great score and my Heart Will Go On was really really really amazing.any way this academy award was really amazing and i think she deserves the nominations and the awards she got
