Finally a movie that shows that there are still some old masters still capable of making great films and living up to their reputation. I watched this film three times in three days before returning it to the DVD rental store. First i watched it alone, then i encouraged my wife to watch it with me and then i watched it again it my brother. Cronenberg's films are so dark and heavy and funny, so trusting him to take on this subject, the Russian mafia in London, wow this is like mixing toxic acids with spirits, there is a reaction. Lovely watching all French Vincent Cassel's performance as Spoiled Russian prat, very convincing. This film goes pretty deep, every corner of it seems well studied. I would encourage one to watch it, not merely as a documentary on this sad subject but just to follow it with a capacity to appreciate the humor in it too. As always Cronenberg is very very graphic.
