Arizona, sizzling sunshine, blazing heat, arid desertÂ… and a lot of darkness. A stranger arrives to a small town that is Superior (in something you're about to identify). 5 years before the 2002 movie 'Eight Legged Freaks' was made, also in Arizona, here you have two-legged freaks near what you could call a Hobbesian state of nature or a psychological 'bellum omnium contra omnes'. But you won't need to speak Latin to decipher what's happening and why. It's all there in human interactions in everyone's life, being not specific to a climate or a geographical location, although here, in the above described Arizona setting, it's present in an extreme form, and is complicated by some no less extreme aberrations of the characters. Apocalyptic plot twists, rhyming with the landscape, in a mixture of Hitchcock and Tarantino. Although you'll find Oliver Stone and Sean Penn together on this team, here there's no political agenda, just subtle, clever, amusing story-telling. The acting is great all around, but I'd give special mention to Billy Bob Thornton. When I realized whom he was playing, I was really astonished. What a transformation from this humanoid chameleon of acting.
