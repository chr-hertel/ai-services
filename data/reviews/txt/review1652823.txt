I have just one simple thing to say.. I hope Chris Nolan directs the fourth one and title it "Spider Man Begins", because this one is plain bad, this said by a guy who loved the 2nd one. Let's not forget that Sam Raimi is the producer and sometimes director of the cheesy series Hercules and Xena, and this one has a little extra cheese.. so much i got sick in the end, maybe the extra cheese makes us forget this and move along. Tobey is also awful, i keep thinking that they sucked on their job on purpose because they didn't want to comeback (alike Keanu in Revolutions). The excess of villains cluttered the whole movie and destroyed what could be an excellent story. I felt no sympathy whatsoever for peter, and after the strange flirting and dancing moves (bad mode) i regret not going to a more expensive restaurant before the session and stay there for 3 hours.. 

Note to director, you got lucky with one rushed sequel (2) .. but another rushed sequel (3), you were asking for it! Go back to Hercules and Xena, and stop putting your unsympathetic brother in your movies..
