Daniel Craig has stepped up to the position with the world waiting to critique him on any small thing that fails to reach Sean Connery's standard...

The world can keep waiting as it was a solid performance with the suave sophistication only a 007 agent could exude.

Firstly, the initial 20 minutes of this Movie is non stop action to the highest standard, probably the best running chase scenes of any bond movie ever.

Unfortunately in contrast to this it does drag for the last 15 minutes and as the action pulls to a stop, then starts, then stops again, its hard to predict how long you are going to be watching for.

The opening credits and witty one liners were true to the history of bond and help get you into the 007 mood.

Bond films are what going to the movies is all about, entertainment. There is no shortage of this here. However lets put this all into context, Nothing beats the brilliance of goldfinger and Dr no. the current rating of 8.2 is unjustly higher then both of them.

Recommended, just alter your high hopes slightly before you see it.
