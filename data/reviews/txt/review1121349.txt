With it's depiction of a boyishly charming, brutally simplistic head of state and fanatics prepared to set aside the protection of law in pursuit of 'the devil', this film is more relevant now than it was when it premiered in the mid-sixties.

Sadly, it's central theme of placing the dictates of conscience above appeals to 'duty' seem almost incomprehensible in post 9/11 America-- even if it's portrayal of ambitious politicians exploiting religion for their own gain is all too very familiar.

'A Man For All Seasons' is a reminder of an all but forgotten era--not Henry VIII's England, but the more thoughtful and less fearful America of a mere forty years ago. It is a fine piece of cinema that has only improved with age.
