Wall E crosses the thin line that most animation movies never dare to approach, & catapults itself into greatness. Yes it is funny in parts, yes it is about the triumph of the underdog, yes kids would love this one 'coz its just heartbreakingly cute. But there's more to Wall E than just that. It is one of the few animation movies that make you think, a thing that the Japanese have long done with their animation, but Hollywood rarely ventured to attempt. Yet it is not a serious ho-hum affair at all, it's sweet, it's endearing & it gives you that same fuzzy feeling that you got after you watched, say Amelie? Watch this one on the big screen, watch this one even if you despise the diabetic cuteness of Hollywood animation films, this is not something you expected.
