I enjoyed Bee Movie, don't get me wrong, but the humor was lacking the "for the whole family" quality it claims to have. Yeah my parents laughed at the pop culture jokes, and my five year old sister laughed at jokes about gas and other bodily functions, but there was little in it for me, I can't completely rag on bee movie though, I loved Chris Rock's cameo as the moose blood loving mosquito, and Jerry Seinfeld was great. Some specific complaints I have other than the humor are that the bee movie universe was a little bit to cartoony, with the leaves shades of purple and pink, if your going to make the movies style like that why do it in CG, why not just go with old fashioned hand drawn? Another thing I held against flick was some of the kiddie jokes, I mean do we really need an old southern lawyer running around in a baby walker in a movie with Jerry Seinfeld? Even with the problems Bee Movie never ceased to entertain, but I still have to say I walked out of the theater a tad bit disappointed.
