Tommy Lee Jones deserves all the accolades that he's getting - he really is the heart and soul of this movie, though it's very much an ensemble. And Josh Brolin is a revelation - he's one to watch. It's a very dark film, but with some clever and frankly charming humor (rather typical of the Coen Brothers). However, despite some great moments, my film-going companions and I agreed that while we liked it, the end was very unsatisfying, and the last 10- 15 minutes almost seemed unnecessary.

Of course critics are raving and predicting Oscars all around, but we agreed that this is exactly the sort of movie that critics swoon for (very arty and important), but that people stay away from in droves. It deserves a viewing, but not many people want to invest in a movie that is so completely lacking in escapism, and has such a dismal view of humanity.
