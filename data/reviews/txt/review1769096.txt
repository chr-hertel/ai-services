37% of the votes for this film are a 1/10 - and that's just atrocious. It makes me sick that people can't appreciate a well-made film that makes an important statement, and would rather write it off as a film that 'hurts the troops.' I watched this earlier and I came on IMDb to rate it, like I do after every film I see - and I was absolutely SHOCKED to see the rating so low. Especially for a newer film - those usually end up between 7 and 8, and if they get mixed reviews, maybe around 6.5 - but a 5.7? SEE this film, it is fascinating - and it will provoke a reaction from you, as great film-making should. It's not flawless, but it has important things to say for all those who aren't plugging their fingers in their ears and humming the entire time.

Bill O'Reilly, I don't mind if you wanna argue with Michael Moore or something - but you stay away from movies, you're out of your element and as usual, you're likely to do more harm than good. I think now would be a good time to remember that he called "Bourne Ultimatum" an 'anti-American' film. Think about that. I can't stress this enough, see this absolutely fantastic film - arguably the best De Palma's made in over a decade.
