I really didn't know what to expect from this film. I've been following it for about a year and the first time I heard about it, like many of you, I was pumped for a reason nobody really knew. It was just Snakes on a Plane.

The movie seemed to be pumped up as kinda a joke film that people wanted to see just because it was Sam J. on a plane with snakes. Well it was just that and it was actually surprisingly great.

It covered nearly every genre in small doses keeping the movie fresh the entire time. The part that surprised me the most was the great script and great acting. As fake as a movie like this might sound, everything felt good enough to be real.

The SFX were deceit enough for me not to complain.. well hell quit reading this and go see the movie. If your into action movies in the least this movie is just for you.

All jokes aside this is the best movie I've seen all year. Definitely a classic.
