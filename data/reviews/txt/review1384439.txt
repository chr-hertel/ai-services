I really don't know anyone who's actually seen all of the Firefly episodes (in the correct order) and wasn't absolutely entertained by them. Firefly is worth bringing back judging from strong DVD sales, even 4 years after it was canceled.

Based on poor decisions by it's network, i.e. choosing to air the episodes out of order, not showing some of the later episodes, failing to properly promote the program and putting it in a less than ideal time-slot ensured low ratings.

Also, as seen by the recent success of the new Battlestar Gallactica, there is a large, growing audience for shows of the genre - a need created by popular shows like Star Trek: The Next Generation and mainstream films like The Matrix.

It makes one wonder whether the content and some of the unconventionally expressed ideas in Firefly was the motivation for it being pulled before it ever caught on.

But come to think of it, the show is very much about an independent spirit, frontier-ism, ingenuity, diversity - ideas that some might consider very typical to the early American doctrine. And, oh yeah, it was pretty funny too. What other show do you recall being able to call itself a sci-fi/western comedic drama? 

To state the obvious, lack of interesting complex shows like Firefly is part of the reason why certain networks are sinking ships, why a growing number of viewers like me opt to turn off their TV sets, TiVo our favorite cable hits it or head straight for the video store instead.

We should demand to have some of the better shows resurrected or have some new ones created that are just as good.

Or were they hoping to clean up in the Nielsen ratings with more seasons of "Stacked"?
