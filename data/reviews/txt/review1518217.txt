A movie that feels like a western with Tracy walking into the wrong town off a high speed train. It's circa 1945 so nobody's packing heat. Walter Breenan is the town vet and mortician, but looking and talking different than I was use to. Marvin & Borgnine play their usual bad guy roles. The film is the first in my memory where a one-armed man beats the crap out of a regular fella (see also Lonely Are the Brave where Bill Raisch- later the one-armed man in the Fugitive gives Kirk Douglas a whooping).

Tracy is excellent as a man on a noble but uncertain mission to learn about the death of a Japanese man he is some how connected to. There's really a lot going on here about responsibility and courage- it seems to me to harken back a bit to High Noon. Robert Ryan preparing to play Wyatt Earp's enemy is good as a calm, normal psycho. Note that John Ericson and Ann Francis were or shortly did marry- not incest. The lesson here is when you travel to a town like Black Rock come by car and have the driver wait.
