What I liked most about this show is that it presented very unique phenomenal situations-- ones you would immediately conclude could not possibly be explained without resorting to supernatural means--and then somehow still manage to give scientific, real-world (even if it was made up) explanations for how the situation came about. 

In other words, it had the intrigue of X-files without the maddening frustrations of explanations never being given, or left hopelessly vague, or story lines simply being left unresolved. Sometimes that's a great thing, but every time and it's just a cop-out. This show never fell into that trap. Sadly, it was probably compared too much to X-files and never developed a following--perhaps simply because former "X-philes" (such as my husband and I) had given up on the predecessor from the very frustrations I mentioned. 

The opening titles were also the best of any show I can remember. Not only would we actually watch them, but sometimes rewind and watch them twice. Wish it were on DVD.
