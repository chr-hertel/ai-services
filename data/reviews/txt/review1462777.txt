If you look in the user ratings and comments, you either hate it or love it. Well I love it. The pace is great, the photography sometimes breathtaking and there is realism in this dark, dark movie. Mann made a new movie and did not look back at the series. I liked the series very much but it never felt realistic to me, just great entertainment. This one does. The lead characters are well played for this kinda movie and Farrell adds something extra here. The other characters are just awesome, casting for this movie was superb picking some relatively unknown actors who play their parts very convincing.

If you look for a revival of the eighties don't go you will be disappointed, if you look for a collateral/HEAT kinda movie don't go either. But if you look for a dark, realistic and tough police flick go and you won't be disappointed.
