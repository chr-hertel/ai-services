In this day and age, we have seemingly come to interpret Tweety Bird as "cute". In his first appearance, he was nothing like that; quite the opposite, he was a bad-ass. In "A Tale of Two Kitties", wandering felines Babbit and Catstello (spoofing Abbott and Costello) find a bird's nest. Grouchy, straight-talking Babbit sends the nervous Catstello up to get the bird, only the tiny avian - whose name isn't actually identified - proves to be the nastiest mother ever. There's naturally an anvil gag.

It's just great to see how the guys behind the Looney Tunes weren't afraid to show anything that they wanted. Definitely one to see.
