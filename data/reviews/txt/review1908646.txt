I have always loved MTV and their fantastic TV shows but this show is just brilliant! Lauren was previously in Laguna Beach which was pretty good but she's come on mountain's. Heidi Montag is her friend who lives in Hollywood but Lauren Conrad had a big fall out with her and is more friendly with Audrina! This show is pure genius and it has proved a huge success at the US ratings! If you love shows with lots of drama and romance and just fun then you'll get a real kick out of "The Hills". It is by far in my opinion the best show MTV has produced ever!!! So the new series of "The Hills" will premiere in fall in Europe and check t out because it is looking unreal!
