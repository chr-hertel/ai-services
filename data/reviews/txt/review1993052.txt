Since it wasn't made by Pixar, Disney, Dreamworks, or Sony, many people will sadly overlook this beautiful film. Yet it is one of the most outstanding movies this year. Hands down. It is amazing.

Despereau is visually magnificent, with interesting and varied character designs, outstanding animation, and an enchanted world which feels more like a storybook than anything before it. The soft lighting and muted color palette give the movie a more serious tone and wondrous atmosphere compared to other recent "brighter" animations such as Bolt or Wall-E. When you watch The Tale of Despereaux, it feels like you are watching an important film with a message.

The voice acting is excellent, with Matthew Broderick and Dustin Hoffman giving heartfelt performances as the main characters. All of the other characters are equally as good, though. William H. Macy and Kevin Kline also give masterful, subtle dialog that really makes their characters come alive. Most importantly, Sigourney Weaver serves as an excellent narrator setting the tone of the movie beautifully. She has a very maternal, calming voice which makes you feels as if you are a kid again, being read to before bedtime.

Despereaux feels like more of a wholesome movie than anything else in recent memory. Unlike Bolt or Wall-E, which both had MAJOR problems structurally, Despereaux delivers a very well crafted story where subplots intertwine, heroes evolve, lessons are learned, and evil is triumphed over. It is unlike any other recent animations, which dumb-down the story and rely on slapstick.

Most importantly it has a message. It is a movie that parents should be proud to take their children to.
