I recently had purchased another film the Goal by this director,when I heard that this film was to screen at a film festival,so I went to see it. It is definitely a very cinema verte style documentary.Usually i don't care for them,but this does reel you in immediately starting with the directors own nephew presenting for a science project,which I thought was very emotional. The film shows what lengths parents go to in order to help their children.Having watched this ,my heart goes out to the families. How brave to make a film about a family member and work to get it before Congress.There should be some special award for these families.All I know is that it made me write to my member of Congress. It was both courageous and educational,with a message of Hope for these families with Dandy Walker.These families even provided some of their own footage.It was real,and raw. Bravo!
