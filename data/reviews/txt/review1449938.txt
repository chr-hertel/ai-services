I watched this movie at the recommendation of a friend this past weekend. I thought it was definitely the MOST disturbing film I have ever seen but at the same time one of the best. I have read the movie begins "mundanely." However, the slow beginning is essential to the plot. There is the repeated metaphor of water throughout the movie: Ben jumping into the pool, Kestie swimming in the ocean. Both of these are symbolic of life giving, opposed to the water Jarrat offers the trio, which ultimately leads to death. And juxtaposed is the freedom, joyful youth at the beginning with the embodiment of human depravity at the end.

I think the most brilliant aspect of this movie is what is not shown. You see how Jarrat'a depravity begins with Cassandra and the final product is also shown. Although there are some graphic scenes, I would not characterize them as gratuitous. What leaves the horrible dread in the audience is what is not seen. The imagination is always worse than the reality (well maybe not in the case of this movie).
