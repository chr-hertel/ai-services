this movies discusses what happens in the back stages of politics....not only that but it also discusses the back stage of human nature...a very deep, very real ,very profound movie.......... how can a governor..a freedom fighter clashes with the "masters"....but he is not innocent though..he uses un noble means to crash his opponents...even if for the right cause!

Jude law played the observer..the link between the rich society and the poor one....he gives u a close look at how some "noble" rich masters are not noble after all ..how life events makes it difficult for some to be honest...so they pay the price.then pretend to be noble again.but at the end ghosts from their past comes eventually and haunt them ! 

how can 3 young persons.with all their life ahead of them..make the wrong decisions and also pay the price.....how can a young son of a well respected and rich father..grows up to be sooo weak soo idealistic...but he also pay the price of being week !!!

a great movie...it's about politics...it's about psychology...it's about.........................Life!
