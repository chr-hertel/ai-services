This film has only one goal and that is to make you wish you had gone to Spring Break in the late 80s/early 90s in Lauderdale. It succeeds admirably. Tim and Dave are two regular guys who find themselves mixed up in a search for a missing heiress. They must find the Delta Pi with the rose-shaped birth mark or lose the prize of 300 million dollars. But what about their new girlfriends? Which will they choose: Money or love? The film isn't Citizen Cane and doesn't try to be. It's full of "hey we're in a movie" jokes and nudity and a soundtrack by a cool band that some how ends up in almost every scene. I also love the fact that when the private eye (the sexy Blake Pickett)tells them who the missing girl's famous father is they recognize his name: Example "She's the daughter of Steven Stratta" "The skate board kid?" "Yes" Everyone in the movie knows that this dude is "the skateboard kid". Anyways, the film has a neat surfer rock soundtrack and tons of T&A and a lot of clubs that are now closed down.
