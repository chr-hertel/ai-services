If you like mystery, sci-fi and horror, you should take a look on "Broken saints" a unique and surreal animated series, being thrilling and emotional at the same time. After I saw the fist episode, I was captivated by the style used by Brooke Burgess: the music,the voices, the atmosphere, the use of colors, everything on "Broken Saints" fits very well with the dark tone of the series. The animation style is quite interesting:Like a comic, characters on the most part remain in static poses and dialogue is indicated by speech balloons. However, rather than exclusively using sequential panels, animated sequences are used to switch scenes and help advance the story, while some music and sound effects are included, lending a more cinematic experience than one would ordinarily achieve with a comic strip alone. And the result of all of this is "Broken Saints", a series that deserves more appreciation that it actually receives.I recommend this tittle to every animation fan.
