In many ways it was the same old, same old as we have seen several times before and seems just an updated version of TCM, but it had more shock and suspense to it somehow.

The bunch of unexpected victims were all played believably by the respective actors and they all managed to portray the "scared but determined to get away" attitude, that we expect from this kind of genre, admirably.

All in all a good movie to watch if you like this kind of genre and you want to be on the edge of your seat and wanting a few jumps and shocks. My only criticism is that because it's a well used subject line there were several scenes I found a little too predictable, although it didn't take way from the appreciation of them.
