Messenger of Death opens with a pair of assassins murdering nine members of a Mormon family, all of them wives and children of Charles Dierkop. This piques the interest of Charles Bronson who is an investigative reporter for the Denver Tribune. He goes out there to the hinterlands of western Colorado to investigate and turns up some interesting information. A Mormon blood feud might not be the reason for the massacre, the motive shall we say might be more commercial.

Bronson's a reporter who carries a licensed weapon. Remember this is Colorado folks, a very red state where they take the right to bear arms seriously. He needs it going out where he's going.

This is some real rural area where some Mormons who never accepted the change regarding polygamy. The law of the land is rather tenuously enforced here, these folks make their own laws. John Ireland and Jeff Corey pay a pair of feuding Mormon brothers, these two have some real hate for each other, they make some of those Appalachin mountain people feuds like the Oxford debating society.

Bronson has two leading ladies with naught a hint of romance with either, in Denver Marilyn Hassett in the boonies, fellow newspaperperson Trish Van Devere. He and Van Devere nearly get themselves killed by some tractor trailers in a nicely staged car chase.

Look for good performances from Daniel Benzali as the ambitious Denver Police Chief and Laurence Luckinbill as the big mover and shaker in Denver politics.

It's a good film with a peek into a world few of the rest of us ever get to see.
