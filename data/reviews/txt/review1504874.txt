Even though the classic western "The Magnificent Seven" is attributed to have been a copy of Japanese epic "The Seven Samurai", I am sure that Producer/Director John Sturges must have been a Cheyenne Bodie fan because everything about "Border Showdown" has elements that Sturges reproduced 5 years later in the Yul Brynner/Steve McQueen blockbuster.

Cheyenne and his sidekick Smitty are on the trail of bank robber Thompson, played by one of the great western bad-guys, Myron Healey.

Thompson has killed one of the townsfolk during the robbery and hightailed it with his gang to a remote Mexican border town where he soon has the inhabitants under his control.

Cheyenne becomes involved because the man that died was an old friend of his and decides to go after Thompson and to bring him back for trial.

When Cheyenne and Smitty arrive....the fun begins!!!
