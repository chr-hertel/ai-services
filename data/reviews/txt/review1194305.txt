A suspense film, that has more in common with "Airport 1975" then any Wes Craven horror movie. An unbelievable plot, characters that seem to have stepped out of a sit-com, and below "TV movie" quality production. Is it my imagination or are most films getting dumber and dumber, I guess Hollywood (or is it Toronto now?) is going for a 10 year old male demographic, or severely retarded adults. But it does have it's laughs (all unintentional). There's a great scene where Rachel's girl in peril character gets head- butted by Cilian's psycho character, and she passes out for a few minutes (funny stuff) and another where they fight, kick and wrestle in the plane's restroom. I guess if I could say one thing positive about "Red Eye" it would be that Rachel McAdams ("Mean Girls","Wedding Crashers") is a total fox.... but she can't act! Cilian Murphy (who fought off zombies in "28 Days Later") gets to play one in this.
