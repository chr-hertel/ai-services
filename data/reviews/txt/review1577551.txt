Some of Beaver's friends are getting carrier pigeons as pets so he talks his dad into buying two of them at the pet store, two that he's had his eye on for a week. Since they are females, he names then "Miss Canfield" and "Miss Landers," his two best female teachers ever. 

Ward brings them home and finds out Beaver was sent home early because he has the chicken pox. He doesn't want the birds to get "Pigeon Pox," so Wally gets stuck taking care of them while the sick and contagious Beaver stays up in his room.

The trouble starts when Larry Mondello - who else? - brings over his two pigeons and asks Wally to keep them for the weekend in the cage with Beaver's pigeons. Larry's family is staying in a hotel for the weekend, so Wally says okay and puts "Nate" and "Al" in with Beaver's birds

Complications arise, first with lice and then with a neighborhood cat killing two of them...but which two, and how to the Cleavers solve this problem without the Beaver getting all upset as he recovers from his illness?

Wally turns out to be the one who handles things diplomatically. 

Was there ever a better brother than Wally Cleaver?
