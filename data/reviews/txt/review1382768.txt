I knew "Squeeze" was too good to end like that. This is not as good as "Squeeze", but most sequels arn't. This is not a bad episode at all, though. Anyway this episode is the triumphant return of Eugene Victor Tooms played by Doug Hutchison (The Green Mile) they also add Paul Ben-Victor (A Civil Action) that plays Dr. Aaron Monte who tries to help Eugene, because he truly believes he is sorry for what he has done.

Mulder can't let this one go, because he knows Tooms will kill again. He is always where Tooms is. It kinda make you feel as annoyed as Eugene must be. You get to see a lot more of what makes him tick and it's a very enjoyable episode. In my opinion Tooms deserved more episodes, but maybe it would get boring. I'll settle for two. It's a great episode, but just don't expect the same as "Squeeze".
