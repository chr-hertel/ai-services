Don't bother wasting money on this pathetic flick. The plot offers definite promise, but the director fails to live up to the promise. The acting is stiff and unbelievable, and 95 percent of the scenes are to dark to see what is going on. The director tries to build suspense, but again falls flat in that every scene is predictable from other films.

I kept watching this cinematic turd in the hope that it would redeem itself, but that never happened. The actors have no idea how real people respond to real situations, and the director doesn't seem to care if his characters have little to no connection with reality. Altogether it makes for a poor trip through fantasy land.

If you can download and watch this crap for free, then you are probably getting your money's worth. If you pay more than 15 cents to view this crap, then you are getting ripped off.
