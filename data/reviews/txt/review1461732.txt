I liked the move ,it was a little short ,but Corey Sosner played a very good punisher ,better than in my opinion ,the last guy ,Tom Jane. The character who played wolverine,Eric Von Sydow , was right on the money ,he's the one that should of been in all the x-men movies. Yea, there was a little prob with some of the voice overs not matching the mouth movements ,but that all quickly went away in the movie. You have to understand ,that this is not a big budget release ,so imagine if they had a a big budget to work with,The results would be incredible. The story line went a little too fast for me. Other than that ,the effects were pretty good ,characters were good.
