The Savages was one of those films that made me feel like I had thrown away two perfectly good hours of my life.

My problems: SO Clich√©d. Was it really supposed to be funny? I LOVE a good black comedy, but smiled only once, and even that was forced. Just plain boring . . . and tedious. 

One star for the movie and one each for the wonderful PS Hoffman and the same good performance, once again, from LLinney.

I guess I'm totally out of step with 99% of the people and critics who find no end to the superlatives with which they are gushing about this can't-forget-it-too-soon movie. Sorry.
