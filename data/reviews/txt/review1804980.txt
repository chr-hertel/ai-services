I've been a huge fan of Johnny Depp, probably longer than Johnny Depp has. I guess I am getting old, since I've been a fan of Tim Burton's for a while as well.

Even though I loved Pee Wee & Big Fish, The best of Tim Brton's films are those that star Johnny Depp. Sweeney Todd might be their best. Not being a fan of musicals had a little affect of what I thought of this movie. The music works, the actors are excellent, & Burton once again takes you to another world, & makes you become a resident for 2 hours. This is what movie making is all about. Leaving the theater, I thought, first I can't wait to see this again on DVD, and second, what will these two do next.
