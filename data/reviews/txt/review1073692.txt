Two college buddies David and Jack go on a cross country trip in the hedgerows of England and are soon attacked by a vicious animal who is subsequently killed by the superstitious villagers. David (David Naughton) survives but Jack (Griffin Dunne) does not and David is taken to a London hospital to recover from his wounds and is treated by a gorgeous British nurse (Jenny Agutter) who likes him a great deal and falls in love with him and invites him to stay with her in her London flat. David is madly in love with her but knows something is terribly wrong with him. David is plagued by nightmares and hallucinations which turn out to be a little more serious than originally supposed. David is turning into something else and he cannot stop it. Or control it. What ensues is a combination of hilarity and tragedy as a result of "Love At First Bite". If you're looking for a happy ending to this doomed little love story then keep looking because you're not gonna find it. The transformation scene is a hallmark of horror and quite a big deal. The special effects are darn good my only comment on them is that the creature looks different the second time as opposed to the first. The first time it looks like an aristocratic dog the second time it looks like a bobcat. Which is cool I guess if you like variety or inconsistency to use a better word. Another point of note is that EVERY SONG played on the soundtrack has to do with the moon. A unique twist on the werewolf genre to be sure.
