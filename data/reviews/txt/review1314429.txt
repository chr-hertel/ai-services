I went to this movie with high expectations, and was completely disappointed. I think the idea was really cool, but just not brought home at all...maybe I just didn't get it, but I would and have recommended to people to not see this movie, I disliked it that much. I found it to be just gratuitous all the way around. And I thought it a really flat performance from Viggo Mortensen who I normally really like and think is an excellent actor. I think he was a good pick for the role, but that the character himself wasn't fleshed out enough. I never really felt like Tom Stall was any kind of real person. I guess the best part was the end- because then the movie was over. If I hadn't paid so much for the ticket, I probably would've walked out of the cinema.
