By hearing lots of controversial reviews about this film i thought to give it a try by watching it. I will frankly admit here that i am not a Big Fan of Mel Gibson movies . Frankly speaking, I was a little hesitant about the film maker Mel Gibson as i am very less familiar with his Acting Skills because i had very few of his work, Maybe one or two that includes Braveheart. But when i watched this movie, I now feel like getting this film in my personal collection which is now a MUST for me.

James Caviezel or Jim Caviezel (Jesus) is arrested and brought in front of the governor. Everyone wants him to be crucified. This is the story that is short but told in the format of a Feature Film. There are some scenes that you have NOT seen in any earlier Jesus Films till date. The scene where the Christ is tortured is an approximately 12 minutes footage that somewhere also gives a Believer a Pain! Performancewise, This film altogether belongs to the protagonist Jim Caviezel (Jesus). He comes up with a brilliant performance. Monica Bellucci was again a good cast in the movie. She hardly had any lines to speak but it was altogether a Performance Oriented part. Maia Morgenstern (Mary) also did her great part with a Brilliance. This kind of acting is sure to give you tears in your eyes. NOTE: The scene where Jesus fells down while carrying the Cross, And Mary runs to him to console. The background score was a plus in this movie. It really scares and makes you emotional at the same time.

As i wrote earlier, I was a little hesitant by the film maker on this movie, But i am very glad to say that the Film Maker proved me wrong here. Mel Gibson (Who is also the Screen writer) handled this script in a very brilliant way. The cinematography and the Special Effects added feather to Mel's cap. I will go ahead and strongly recommend this movie to Christ Film Lover as it stands up to all the expectations!!!
