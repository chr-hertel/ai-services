I really don't enjoy this movie much, just some of the songs like "Mine,Mine,Mine" and "Just Around The Riverbend." But the plot isn't the best out of the other Disney movies. So, I say it's not something that would be a good movie to watch so many times. I saw it in the theater, and didn't enjoy it to much. Only certain parts of the movie are funny. The songs are good, but the plot isn't very good. I saw it a few times, haven't watched in four years, so that tells you something. I just think it's not the best out of the Disney Movies, like Lion King, Toy Story, and other movies. So I give it a 5, it's alright, but not good. That's all I have to say about it.
