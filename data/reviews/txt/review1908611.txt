First off whats wrong with this movie is pure lack of research that Ken Russel and his team must have put into this, rather sensationalises new age concepts and shaman practises. This film is complete utter nonsense and seems to be coming from the mind of a conceited coke head than a new age tripper. 

The main character, far from being introverted as one viewer commented, is purely a selfish self centred, narcissist. There was no regression to caveman to be done because he was already one anyway, about as devolved as this movie. This seems purely like a cynical attempt to cash in on concepts and ideas of the time, badly mixing subcultures and new age ideas. Using a mish mash of ideas being thrown about at the time to create a rather weak horror story. Unfortunaly it seems a lot of folk fell for it.

Fails on so many levels, horror film, sci-fi, drug film, love story (love for himself maybe) 

I watched for the first time in 2008 with someone that watched this when it came out, their memory thought it was kind of crap then, nothings changed and i agree. Years later its easier to see the flaws in this movie but i find it hard to imagine it being good back then.. and i think some of you need to evolve your tastes or take off those rose tinted glasses you all seem to have on.

a waste of time - smoke some DMT instead.
