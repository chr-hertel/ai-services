Wow loved this adaptation on TV and kept me interested all the way through. The plot etc. Loved almost every role that all portrayed. But i missed the very start as i was late viewing this brilliant fun drama. Its a great production in its own rite as "trainspotters and lovers" will find a soft spot for, as "Gus and Natalie" go thru the days, there romance blossoms ... 

Worth seeing if you can get the chance but I've never seen a repeat of this amazing film.... Hope 1 day will come when there's a DVD out soon ... please let me know if there is :-) its "bostin".
