I too, watched this with my daughter! We were living in North Carolina at the time, and it really piqued my interest in Gullah culture, since it was so close by. The show was so positive the kids were real and fun, the parents so smiley and happy, and who didn't love Binyah Binyah polliwog! My daughter loved the bright colors of the set and clothing that the cast wore. I am so happy to see that the Daises are still married. The show had such a good vibe surrounding it that we couldn't help but get caught up in it! Our cable company airs reruns of this wonderful show on a kids channel. Definitely one of the better children's programs of the 1990's. Thanks Ron and Natalie for the great entertainment!
