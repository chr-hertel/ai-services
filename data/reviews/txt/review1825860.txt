Last night I was in the mood for a movie - any movie - and so I popped "Dreamland" out of the unseen stack of my DVD collection.

I did not expect all too much, so I was very pleasantly surprised to find out that it was actually very good.

The first thing I noticed was the beautiful photography. There are some really breathtaking shots, at least if you watch it on a big enough screen.

Secondly the story, while slow paced, is kinda nice and comes in several layers. Sort of a "feelgood-movie", even if all of the characters have their problems throughout the movie.

The acting was pretty good, but especially John Corbett blew me away. No more nice guy like in Sex and the City or the Greek Wedding. Instead he sometimes reminded me of Jeff Bridges in "The Big Lebowski". Which in fact is a big compliment, coming from a guy who watched Lebowski for Idontknow how many times.

Definitely a well-earned eight on my scale!
