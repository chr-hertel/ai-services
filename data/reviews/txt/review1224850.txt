Oh my God ! How it's possible to create a so idiot "movie". But the good side I think, it is a movie to show to people who want create one tell them to never make a thing like that. Story have no sense, music is ugly, and they are any actors/actress inside. The offline is so idiot.

It's pity to see that Carmen Electra use a stand-in just for naked scene. Why not use stand-in for act too? It's clear the only thing this girl have is a nice face (well with make-up all is possible)

This movie is a good example that in our wonderful capitalist world, "be beautiful" is the more important thing after to be rich. Shauna Sand Lamas is a joke too. I find funny that two main guys ("actors" Conrad Bachmann and Tim Bagley) and two girls ("actress" Shauna Sand Lamas and Carmen Electra) have practically same body.

If you like nice face you will love this "movie".

But if for you a movie is not a "face", never buy or rent this c..p.

And to "listen" this so bad things, you need to be a lot courageous. I prefer to advice you.
