I really enjoyed watching this movie, it is a very good parody of Walk the line and I LOVE the music! I really do enjoy the jokes.

But really, this is one of the best film-music I have ever heard. This film is a must if you enjoy good comedy that doesn't go over the line and just become a mess like "Meet the sparans" or "Superhero movie".

I don't really have word for how awesome the music of this movie is good!

Normally I hate musicals, because I think the music is pretty empty and shallow, but the music in this movie has very good rhythm and funny lyrics but still good written.

I give this movie 10/10 because of the music, but the movie is good to.

You have to see this movie!
