"Meet the Robinsons" is just superb in every way - plot, animation, characters, substance, and music. All put together in an astoundingly gorgeous film - easily enjoyed by ALL ages. Clever, clever humor and wit - many things that only adults may understand. Loved the way the story progresses and how it ends.

Love the music. Gorgeous "Little Wonders" by the fantastic Rob Thomas played at the end coordinated with the story ending - beautifully done. And the phenomenal Jamie Cullum doing 2 great songs for Frankie the Frog - 2 bouncy songs, done to perfection by a great artist. Enjoyed Rufus Wainwright's songs - fit in well with the story. And, Danny Elfman's score is wonderful. So, I also highly recommend the soundtrack!!! I really do not have enough superlatives for this movie. It could be my favorite Disney film, (and I've seen them all). I definitely plan on seeing it again in 3-D. But, even in 2-D, it is not to be missed!!
