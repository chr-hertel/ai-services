I have to say, the Burton-Depp combination has proved to be quite enjoyable! Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow. Big Fish and now Charlie and the Chocolate Factory! You all know how the story goes: Willy Wonka(Depp)invites 5 kids (including Charlie( Freddie Highmore) into his factory after remaining closed for a number of years. What happens inside the factory is beyond your imagination! The scenery and graphics were magnificent as well as every kids individual song composed by the great Danny Elfman, who has accompanied Burton through a number of movies. (Big Fish,Sleepy Hollow) From what i have deduced, this movie, in comparison to the 1970's version, is closer to the book, but still has some extra "fluff".

I don't think Burton could have done a better job on having Depp as Wonka. His kookiness and eccentricity made him a very funny character! And his costume! Very detailed!! ( Work of Burton, no doubt!) All in all, there are a few loopholes to be filled, but it deserves a high 9 out of 10!!!!
