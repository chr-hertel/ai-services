Captain Blood was an important picture in its day. It marks the beginning of a cycle of swashbuckling adventures starring Errol Flynn and directed by Michael Curtiz. It was also the first major heroic action movie of the 1930s, and was a key part in the process of cinema getting back on its feet again after the setbacks of the depression era and the coming of sound.

Errol Flynn was basically filling up a void left by Rudolph Valentino and Douglas Fairbanks, and Captain Blood picks up where the silent swashbucklers left off. You have the handsome, dashing hero with brains to boot, the sweet and simple love interest, and sneering, despicable villain. But now the action picture is back with sound, giving the added element of rousing speeches and cutting remarks, razor sharp as the hero's sword. Actually, Errol Flynn's acting isn't quite up to scratch yet in this picture, but he moves well and delivers the sassy dialogue in the perfect tone.

Michael Curtiz gives a certain style to this film, with gritty close-ups, eerie shadows and a prowling camera. It's no surprise when you look at this to recall that Curtiz had spent most of the early 30s making horrors. However it's when the action begins that you really see where his forte lay. Unfortunately, it's forty-five minutes before we get a proper action scene (one of a number of problems with pacing that Captain Blood has), but what incredible action! The editing is fast and punchy, you never see a single shot for longer than is necessary, but each image really stands out with brilliant arrangement of actors and imaginative camera angles. It's often been said that Curtiz was a very versatile director, and this is true, but as far as I'm concerned the only area in which he was a genius was in directing these action sequences.

One of the nastier leftovers from the days of the silent action picture is the role of the love interest. Captain Blood is stronger, more intelligent and even morally superior to Olivia de Havilland's character, and there's something rather creepy about her attraction to him and his domineering acceptance of her. In nearly all these films the female lead was a relative of the villain. This is significant Â– it implies she is a prize to be won from the enemy. It's not a love story that's easy to connect to or feel any sympathy for.

One of the biggest regrets with Captain Blood is its under-use of Basil Rathbone. He is easily the best actor of the bunch, and a far better villain than Lionel Atwill, but here he is only squeezed into a little ten-minute subplot. Even his sword duel with Flynn is not as good as those in later Flynn swashbucklers.

Captain Blood is a long way from being the best Curtiz/Flynn collaboration, but it's not at all bad. The action scenes don't come as often as they should, but they are certainly worth waiting for. Flynn and Curtiz would revisit similar territory in The Sea Hawk, a superior and, incidentally much darker film than the good, wholesome fun of Captain Blood.
