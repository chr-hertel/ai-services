It's extraordinary how something like the nickel can be the subject of a documentary from MGM which ends with statements from four of their stars to write letters overseas to let European know what America is really like.

It begins with a look at the nickel over the years and how it became the most used bit of currency from Americans during the '20s and '30s (and even '40s), buying everything from a haircut to a beer or a visit to a movie house known as "the Nickelodeon".

The rather dry narrative goes on and on extolling the virtues of spreading America's capitalistic system throughout the world by writing letters which can be posted for a nickel to all your European relatives or friends, concluding with the brief statements from Leslie Caron, Ricardo Montalban, Pier Angeli and Zsa Zsa Gabor, all of whom speak in their native languages. Seems to be saying what we all know--the pen is mightier than the sword to spread democracy.
