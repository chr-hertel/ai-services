I vote 8 only because I have seen a lot of films. When I saw this film at Telluride 2005 and when I watched it again tonight, it was a perfect film to me.

I happen to run the independent theatres in Salt Lake City, Utah that showed Brokeback. The ONLY theatres in Salt Lake City, Utah that showed Brokeback. But that's another story.

I feel tonight, like I did that night - if only all of the conservatives, well-bred Mormons, well-bred catholics, southerners, northeasterners, 70 somethings, mid-westerners, surfers, wrestlers, construction workers, Japanese, homo phobics, Golden Retrievers, people with scars, Egyptians, people who hate people with scars, The Swiss, The English, Handi-able people, gay handi-able people, Canadians, trans-gendered handi-able people, and most of all those who call themselves liberal - could have seen this film before all of the hype, it could've done something.

Most of all, I mean the Conservative well-bred Morman woman in Utah. This is who I thought about when I first saw it at Telluride - with no hype or jokes. If they came to our theatre, because they loved Cold Mountain and sat through Brokeback Mountain. I'm sure they would go home questioning their beliefs. And I thought about that again tonight..

What do I do? AB
