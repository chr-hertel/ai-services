This movie was an enjoyable archetypal hero story that used a wholly creative new style of animation that I have not seen before creating a very strong feel to the film. The visuals were absolutely vivid. Fast paced, sometimes to its own detriment, this movie does a great job of keeping the story moving but often short changes some details that could lead to stronger character development. However if this movie in fact is a part of a trilogy as has been proposed, then this is a strong start setting the stage for more complex character development and even greater involvement in this fantasy world that clearly had a lot of thought and depth to it. I liked it. The characters each grew and evolved throughout the film. Even if only slightly, the changes were noticeable. The all-star cast lends charisma and charm to the characters. I felt immersed in their alien world. I felt that the characters were both real and grounded. They didn't consist of airy nothingness like the characters in so many created worlds. It was an interesting story based on political mistrust, fear, diversity, misunderstanding, and love. It was a movie that we can relate to and that can inspire. Go see it. More than anything this movie suffered from a total lack of an advertising campaign. With no advertisement it is no surprise that this movie had such a poor start.
