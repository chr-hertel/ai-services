The series is first rate. It has a terrific script with poems integrated into speeches, etc. When Elizabeth says goodbye to the Duke of Anjou there is her voice-over of a stanza or so from a poem attributed to Elizabeth, "On Monsieur's Departure" a poem by Queen Elizabeth I.

Strangely enough I'll be teaching the poem to my students in the next few weeks, so the video will come in handy for helping them understand the central tension of the poem.

My Freeview box is playing up a little so I'll need to buy the DVD when it comes out - and I'd be glad to do so, too. 

I'm looking forward to the next episode that is scheduled on MORE 4 tomorrow evening.#

US viewers, don't miss this as it one of the best scripted and acted dramas that I've seen all year.
