I found this movie slow in the beginning as it sets up the story, but it quickly became very engrossing. The plot is not overly intricate to the point that the viewers become lost...but complex enough to keep them guessing about the final outcome. It was a wonderful balance of intrigue and mystery.

There were lots of depth to the characters and delightful performances. This is the first time I've seen Justin Timberlake acting and he was surprisingly believable in his role. Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone proved that they are still a strong force on-screen. I was captivated by Ms. Stone's transformation and her dialogue delivery in the interview scene. 

It was a cunning script and plenty of visuals to keep a viewer enticed. This is not normally my type of movie, but I would highly recommend it.
