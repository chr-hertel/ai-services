this film is fantastic and its been along time due. I'm not going to comment on the performances as I'm not fan of either kapoor.

what makes this difference from other comedy movies is dialogue and chosen method on how to deliver. other comedies focus creating a scene where something stupid will happen and then waste 15 minutes or nowadays a whole film around it.

the characters are believable and the situation can actually happen it is not a comedy with complete fiction. the language and tone of this film is vibrant and bubbly. the contrast of language and tone from each of these individuals enhances the scene.

its comedy is based centrally around two different personalities and how they change one another's life even if its a clash.

romantic movie? i don't know i would call it that, but a good comedy with some romantic notion. it kind of reminds me dil hai ke manta nahin...
