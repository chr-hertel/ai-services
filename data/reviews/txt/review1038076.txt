This is a beautiful movie, superbly acted on every account and a powerful story about the basest of human fears/desires. The idea that we should all choose our own death and time of death in crisis is one worthy of debate. However, the film quickly lead me to believe that this was a tribute to a man not a film that is seriously considering euthanasia It left me feeling that the director was at last unwilling to explore the true depths of the sea inside. I feel like it missed a genuine opportunity to forward our discussion of euthanasia by quickly descending into stereotyping and caricatures in juxtaposition to Ramon Sampedro. Without a doubt, this is a must see movie but not a 10 because of the reliance on emotion to ebb it's way in to our social consciousness. A movie that takes itself this seriously needs to be willing to take the leap.
