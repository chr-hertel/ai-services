Actually there isn't much to say about this movie, only that it's a great sex-comedy. There is many dirty jokes, much of them are pretty stupid too and that's what is good about it. It's not all about sex there was whole one minute which wasn't about sex. I'm talking about "there can be only one" scene, which was really funny, funnier than that was only the scene where Seth Rogen's character showed his school-photo. So if you like stupid but at the same time funny jokes, you should watch this film, because there is lots of stupid jokes. The movie is also very well directed and has some great tracks, like Blondie's "Dreaming"
