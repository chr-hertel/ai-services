this movie was better than i expected. very very moving and original. this is the type of movie that can make Spanish, Latinos, and Mexicans proud. I'm showing this movie to everyone i know and i highly recommend it. The visual and audio aspects of the movie were very well done. the only thing i did not like was the techno music they would occasionally play, but that's a small issue that doesn't matter. Whoever the director is, you can be sure that i will follow their career and movies he or she makes in the future. Please, if you see it, rent it or buy it. Another Hispanic/Mexican/Spanish movie i would recommend is "killing words", that is also a great movie.
