I just finished watching Sin City and can honestly say this is the worst movie ever - (that I've seen). The disturbing amount of cheesy one-liners could make this movie laughable, except for the grossly offensive and excessive use of violence. To what theatrical end? Who knows.

I cannot say enough bad things about this movie. There may be someone who likes it and tries to indicate some redeeming value can be derived from it. I am not artsy enough, dark enough or deranged enough to agree. I can liken recommending this movie to a friend - the same way one would encourage a non-smoker to pick up a pack of cigarettes.

There is nothing more to say about this movie except; don't see it.
