This much talked about film has been perhaps one of Gibson's most mysterious projects to date. Unfortunately, like all directors experience eventually, this film is not one of his best. Set in time of the Mayan empire, it focuses on their violent nature and fascination with death. Everyone knows that the native cultures of South and Central America were violent, however this film goes over the top to a ridiculous and distracting degree. It seemed every two minutes someone was being stabbed, maimed, or gutted. The plot was very weak, nor you could not attached yourself to any character to a great degree. In the end all the killing took away from the movie. In this case, less is more.
