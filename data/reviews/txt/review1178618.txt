I have come to expect thrillers like this to be just a tad disappointing. The audience enters the movie just to find out the answer to a question, and this takes away from the actual film. That said, I am glad that Flightplan did not cop-out on an explanation like so many recent thrillers.

Overall, I was somewhat impressed at times by the atmosphere/tone generated to replicate a flight experience, and the acting held up in most places. It was entertaining enough, but cliché, odd slow motion choices, and cheesy dialogue kept me from really getting into this movie.

If you want to see it and don't live in a city, go to a matinée.
