I've bought this movie from one of those London's Erotica events.. I won't say more about it in case the kids reads this.. But I must say, I was lucky enough to meet Jesse Jane there..

Anyway, back to the movie.. This one is all about Jesse Jane playing Heather who witnesses a murder which leads to a vicious crime lord. With two cops on her side, they work together as they try to investigate the whole scenario and conspiracy behind the killing.

With that in mind, you got an action flick blended with so much eroticism. Well, that's basically what you've got there..

Nic Andrews is a type of director who wants to make porn movies close to mainstream stuff.. ..And this is his example.. Anyway, he did a good job. The DVD had a lot of good features on there which I can't mention. Anyway, if you ever see this movie.. Enjoy it, that's all I can say. STRICTLY FOR ADULTS ONLY! 8 out of 10!
