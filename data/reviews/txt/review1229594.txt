I remember seeing the original version with Dolph Rundgreen a long time ago and thinking it was a good film. I was excited to see how this new version would be like and had high expectations since this remake even scored better than the original! I was very annoyed from the first seconds of this film. The film was filmed in such dark places that you hardly could not see anything! Yes even when i did put brightness and contrast to full! It was almost night all time or the scenes were in rooms with no windows. Most of the action sceenes you could not see anything until there was an explosion and you could see something for a second! This made it extremely difficult to follow the plot, since you could not know who was in the scenes because of the darkness. Most of times you just saw some shadows. This is the worst directing i ever seen! The plot was a Darkman ripoff. If you have not seen this film, I suggest you stick with the original instead or go for Darkman! This movie is completely destroyed because of awful directing and production!
