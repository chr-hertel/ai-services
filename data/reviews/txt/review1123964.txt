I stumbled across this movie one boring Sunday afternoon while channel surfing for something to pass the time and an hour and a half later, felt unbelievably stupid for sitting through the whole thing. This is film making at its lowest point, one of the worst abominations ever committed to celluloid I've seen, so why it has so many good reviews on these pages completely eludes me.

The story is a send-up of the famous mission of Lewis & Clark across America, focusing on their two fictitious rivals (played by Perry and Farley) attempting the same trek. Watching the duo's many comic adventures in the American wilderness unfold, it is obvious the director was aiming for a 'stupid but fun' vein of comedy similar to that of the Monty Python team, but it backfires spectacularly. Why? Simple, the acting is utterly appalling. Fed with dozens of terrible lines, Perry and the rest of the cast's performances are played so ridiculously over the top, it removes any potential laughs from the film altogether. You see better acting at sixth form drama students end of year exam pieces.

My advice here then would be to avoid this one. Everything is over the top, the acting, the storyline and any potential for humour is ruined by the sledgehammer like subtlety of the dialogue. If Ed Wood had directed comedies rather than science fiction, this would have been the result.
