Oh My God, i can't believe i wasted $8 bucks on this piece of crap.I mean the some of the jokes were funny but most of them seem like an 8 year old that just learned what sex was would write. Me and my friend felt so ripped off.I mean i liked Date Movie which was rated worse than this, so i thought i would like this. They really need to get the writers from 1 & 2 on this! UHH!! I FEEL RIPPED OFF!!!!!!!!!!! This movie is most likely suited for children under 12 that think poop jokes are funny.1&2 were much more funny but I don't know what they did to this series, they just made it more disgusting and retarded. My advice to you don't spend $8 dollars like me on this and wait for the DVD release.
