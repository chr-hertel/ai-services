Not usually a Tim Burton fan, although I can never really complain. I thought the Big Fish was original and told a warm story that will connect with anyone who has loved a parent as any child does and then lost them.

Big Fish will remain with me for a very long time- a true keeper.

Now, if we could get Follywood to endorse/produce similar art, then perhaps their movie attendance would creep back up.

(Apologies for the soap box)
