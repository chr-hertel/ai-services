It was non-stop action - but that is kind of the problem. Overall, I did not feel cheated. It was entertaining and a good way to spend a Sunday afternoon, however, I never got the same "thrill" as I had in the previous films. Perhaps it is just because it is the third one, and there is little new - particularly in the plot, which is rehashed from the last movie. There is lots of chasing. Chasing in cars, on foot, in buildings, across buildings, in train stations... you get the idea. 

It starts out in Moscow, where Bourne takes out a bunch of Russian Police (which is never really explained), then as he gets snippets of his memory back, he goes on the same spree as before. He spends the movie tracking down answers to his past and showing off lots of CIA uber-agent skills and survives more death encounters than Friday The 13th Jason Voorhees. There is minimal mind engagement and most of the movie is about Bourne's physical prowess. The end was anti-climatic at best. Lastly, The camera movement was maddening. I saw this movie with 7 other friends, and universally that was the chief complaint. One actually said there should be a warning that watching this could cause epileptic seizures. While I understand the intent is to make one feel as though they are in the middle of the action, it really just made me nauseous. Overall: It's OK.
