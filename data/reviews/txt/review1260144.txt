I really like this movie for so many reasons. I love the friendship that lasted so long between Hilary and CC. It's so strong and powerful. But you have to admit that Hilary became quite a bitch after CC became a big star and all. But as we all know, she was just a little jealous. I also love it for the humor and the talent. I love how they both have big dreams in life that they want to achieve. I hate that Hilary had to die when she had a daughter and a best friend she had to leave behind. This is a very moving film for ages. This movie has been out for at least eighteen years and is still a great movie for everyone. Great laughs. Great cries.
