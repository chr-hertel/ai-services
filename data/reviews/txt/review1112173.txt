This very sweet account of at-risk fifth graders becoming involved in a NYC young persons' ballroom competition has all the elements of a sure fire winner --- and scores a bullseye. The filmmaker lets the camera and the children tell the story, and through their guileless conversations and struggles to compete, they win us over and engage our attention in a way professional actors can only dream of. There are some the camera seems to love most, but you will not encounter a personality in the film that does not win you over for the moment that he or she is in the spotlight. The teachers too add to the rich mix (what a selfless group) and the suspense builds as the teams move toward the finals. I am not sure how the filmmaker caught all the spontaneity and relaxed candor captured in the quick moments that make up this bright human montage, but it's all there and only a heart of stone could fail to be moved by accomplishments of these kids and their supporters. Bravo! Bravo!
