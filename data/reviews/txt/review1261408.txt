After seeing some bad reviews about it, being surprised by the way Cannes ignored it, I went to the theater with a little bit fear to see the new Von Trier. 2 hours and a few minutes later, I could see that this incredible director still gives us an incredible source of thoughts and views in his movies, with a highly sophisticated realization matching perfectly the story.

The speech is eloquent, giving a different way to think. With this film, the consensus doesn't matter, it goes straight to the point, but whereas Dogville was a little bit demagogic, this one gives us a lot of different indication, Grace is less one-sided, she fools himself in the trap of slavery, she's less unreachable, being overwhelmed by her sexual desire, and the film become more exciting and complex. Moreover, there are more events and motion and the film is less boring than Dogville was at the first view.

To finish i'll say that Manderlay isn't only a brilliant sequel to Dogville, but an evolution in narration with a completely different topic
