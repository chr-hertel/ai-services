I thought this was the best of the Harry Potter films so far. Quite possibly because I couldn't remember the little details in the book, and it had been years since I read it. The first two movies, although good, didn't seem quite like what I pictured. Because I had little preconceptions, I liked it more overall. I thought it was very easy to follow, and a cute movie. It's nice seeing the main actors older, and acting more like teenagers. Their non-uniform attire also makes it better, in my opinion. The effects were good, and beautiful backgrounds only added. Some construe it as darker than the others, and perhaps it is, but only a little. The characters are growing older, after all. It was a good movie, I really liked it, and I can't wait for the next one.
