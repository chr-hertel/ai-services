Low budget. Good vibe. Great mood. Funny, heartfelt and sincere. Convincing performances, especially by Alberto Rosas. Very good cast and crew work - good production quality for only $30.000. I'd recommend it to everyone who liked "The Broken Hearts Club". The best thing about this movie is that it doesn't pretend to be anything else but itself - low budget film with witty and honest script, good cinematography and solid performances. In the interviews on DVD director says that before he made this movie he watched a lot of "gay" films where gay people were either coming out, or crazy maniacs, or dying some horrible death. Instead of it "Gyspy Boys" takes viewer on a very enjoyable ride with it's charming characters exploring everyday life problems anyone can relate to. P.S.: Also reminded me of sort of low budget "Queer As Folk".
