What an awful conclusion to what was a wonderful franchise. As a fan of the comic books as a child, I was very happy with the first two installments of the x-men. Alas, All good things must come to an end, and they did. I will add another director to my list of those whose movies I will always question before I invest valuable time. In fact, I found myself looking at my watch a couple of times. My movie going parter even thought it was dull - and she liked "Fantastic Four." Go figure. It's not that they didn't try - the cast simply didn't have a good screenplay to work with. Special effects alone do not make the movie. And from the interviews with the cast that I've read, they knew.
