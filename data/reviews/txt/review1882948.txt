I'm not one of those people who like happy endings so this really shocked me when it got to the end scene i won't ruin it by telling you...

Watch this movie! It even gave me nightmares for a while and a film has'nt done that since beetlejuice! (i was young when i watched it) i have'nt read the book but a book would'nt ruin this film that other comment about it is rubbish. It's one of the best newish horror films i've see in many years and it re-newed my phobia of certain bugs. Its a perfect Friday night in film with the mrs but keep hold of the popcorn if shes scared of creepy crawlys!
