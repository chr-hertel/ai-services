No matter what your stance about Global Warming you should see this movie. It provides hard data, then takes time to carefully explain it. This is interspersed with some really funny moments. I loved the scene from Futurama :

Suzie: (in movie) How do we get wid of the gweenhouse grasses?

Narrator: (in movie) Fortunately, our handsomest politicians came up with a cheap, last-minute way to combat global warming. Ever since 2063 we simply drop a giant ice cube into the ocean every now and then.

(The movie cuts to a shot of a aircraft dropping a large ice cube into the ocean and then cuts back to the classroom.)

Suzie: (in movie) Just like Daddy puts in his drink every morning. And then he gets mad.

Narrator: (in movie) Of course, since the greenhouse gases are still building up, it takes more and more ice each time. (There are shots of bigger ice cubes being dropped into the ocean.) Thus solving the problem once and for all.

Suzie: (in movie) But--

Narrator: (angry; in movie.) Once and for all!

(The movie quickly ends with the caption "The End".)
