Why watch this movie if you aren't expecting a super cool dance flick with the moves and shakes that make you zeal for the streets? Of course, u shouldn't be expecting a hearty romance with couples doing a lovely nice ballet on the 'dance floor'!! This movie is about the "Streets", and surely does it stand up to its expectations...

Highly recommended for all movie buffs who want to enjoy a flick that promises the crudeness of streets in the dance fraternity... It shows that dance is not just about winning or losing in a competition, but way more... And the way Andie puts it in the movie...."Its not about what you have ... its about what YOU DO with what you have!" 

I enjoyed this movie to the fullest, and hope you'd like it if you have danced for once in your life... even if it was for the small one that you did on the Disc floor, trying to impress the girl dancing close!!
