I am not an expert about the history of Great Britain, but it is very clear that this film wasn't intended to tell history as it could have been... This film is more about entertainment, but unfortunately the exaggerations are just too many... Yeah, I mean when you put to fight 20... or OK even 30 against 6 or 7 very cool knights, and the knights win... OK I can accept it... 100!! and I'm far away of my limit, but OK... but thousands... c'mon gimme a break. And the woman warrior, OK she is hot, she is a great archer, but also a great swordwoman, she can kill also thousands of Saxon warriors, without even losing the lipstick on her lips? oh my god... too much fantasy. And the Saxons... why are they so bad and stupid? I've lived in Saxony and people there are quiet normal, some of them are really smart actually, and I think they had some worthy warriors in the past, at least they were never really conquered by the Romans or other empires... but in this film they seem to be disabled or idiot people or something like that, I don't know if this is very respectful to history or other cultures (by the way I am not Saxon)... if you want to see good fights between Saxons and Romans better see Gladiator... and if you want to see a good film about King Arthur, then wait for something better, something more serious to come...
