The movie is classified as a thriller, and as the story goes on and develops I started thinking that all happening to Linda was some sort of plan to drive her crazy and allow him to live his love affair. But instead it was not that way. More than a thriller I would have considered it as a drama. Never boring, never exaggerating, never irrealistic or Hollywood like, which would have been the case if Jim would not have died at the end, but saved by her premonitions. Sandra Bullock is simply fantastic in this role. Actually the whole cast is perfect. A great movie that makes you think and that leaves you with something inside. If you love somebody, just let them know. Don't wait.
