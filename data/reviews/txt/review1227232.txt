I know this has been heard many a times, but I am sincerely one of the great and many Johnny Cash Fans! I have been to the same theater six times to see this movie, I just cant get enough of it; please please tell me this will be out on video!! The very second and sixth time I went to see this show, I took this same friend of mine with me. He, and its a crying shame I must say, has never been introduced to Johnny Cash, nor June or any fellow artists in that era. But, he went both times, and each time, he never took his eyes off the screen. He was just as fascinated as I was and has now become more familiar with the one and only, great and historical, Johnny Cash. I thank you kindly for producing this film; if I had one last request before I died, it would be to see this movie just one last time. It would be a crime, and I mean a serious crime to show this film and never put it on the shelves for the many fans to have, hold and cherish the rest of their lives, I cant stress it enough!! Thank You Kindly, Tiffany Fanning.
