Alright, not many people have seen this flick that I know of so I feel obligated to review since it was recently put up. I saw this film through a friend of mine who knew someone involved in the production over a year ago. First off it was the director's first feature so I have taken that into consideration in my review. Let's be honest it's not the best film out today, but it ranks up there if you look back on many director's first feature film attempts. The director was still in high school when the movie was made, but I don't really know if that is true or not. The first thing that pops to mind when I think about this movie is the quality and masterful skill shown in the soundtrack that stayed consistently amazing throughout the whole movie captivating the scenes very well. For the most part the acting was good except in a few scenes where the lead really had to pull the slack in order to save the scene. The directing was good, but certainly lacked in a few scenes. I found the dialog very unusual surrounding the situations the actors were in which added a kind of zing to it. The camera-work was rough, but somehow worked with the movie I remember. The sound was the worst part of the film, but if you can get into the story it seams like an after thought. I saw the film a while ago and still remember it so that counts for something, right.Peace.
