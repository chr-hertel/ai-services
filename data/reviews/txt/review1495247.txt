Jack, Kate and Sawyer are kidnapped by "The Others" and put in different environments. Kate has a shower, gets a dress and is invited to have breakfast on the beach with Henry Gale; Sawyer is locked in a cage for wild animals and without food or water, being "awarded" when he hits a lever as if he were an animal; and Jack is locked in a sort of aquarium, being interrogated and controlled by Juliet, who has a complete report about his life. Meanwhile, Jack recalls his divorce process with Sarah.

The beginning of the Third Season is a weird episode focused in the former life of Jack and disclosing some aspects of the life style of "The Others". After three months without "Lost", I found "A Tale of Two Cities" intriguing, and it seems that the story is going to have a big twist, now finally disclosing "The Others". Henry Gale increased his importance in the series, since he is one of the leaders, and a new Machiavellian character, Juliet, is introduced. What I like most in "Lost" is that I do not guess what may happen in the next episode. My vote is seven.

Title (Brazil): Not Available

Note: On 3 April 2013, I saw this episode again on DVD (divided in two parts).
