this is how i could summarize "Klute" - it has a good cinematography, good acting (Jane Fonda excels) and an effective soundtrack. The film was released in 1971 in a time in which everything was changing fast, so "Klute" doesn't pass judgement or try to deliver any moral message.

Simply told the story runs like this: "A detective, Klute (Donald Sutherland) is engaged to find a man, Tom Gruneman, that disappeared mysteriously. No one knows if he's dead or alive. The only link Klute has is Bree (Jane Fonda), a high class hooker that apparently Tom Gruneman was frequenting before his disappearance. Klute goes to see her. His investigations progress but soon it's clear that someone is after Bree's life." 

I think that in spite of its sophistication, "Klute" falls short. It doesn't work as a thriller and it hasn't really involved me. The film is good, but the detached look that Pakula gives to characters and places, makes the film lose the emotional impact it could have had if it had a more personal touch.

"Klute" seems to be a film that was carefully planned and executed. Pakula is a good director - visually "Klute" is a beautiful film, and it is also an interesting period piece (better anyway than the majority of thrillers made nowadays), and Jane Fonda is very good as Bree - it's thanks to her that "Klute" managed to keep my interest.
