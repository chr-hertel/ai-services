It wasn't the box office success of the millennium - if anything, it grossed barely enough money to get a pickled egg in Netto. But it doesn't matter about how much it made - it is a great film, and shows that Danny Boyle (who normally directs rough adult films - Trainspotting and 28 Days Later are two prime examples) is actually a very adaptable director, who has a calm side to him. It shouldn't be a 12, but it is gripping in parts, and stays very loyal to the book. There are lots of bright colours and fancy visuals in the film - enough to keep the eyes entertained.

Millions deserves to be put in the "Crime" category - the actual robbery that it revolves around must be one of the most cunningly made and written ever. And after that, the film becomes even more fun to watch - with rough and emotional sides to it, it works extremely well. However, it is primarily a heart-warming film - the visions of British schools it displays are far too soft to be real - everybody seems to be friendly with each other. But that is my only minor nag about this film - apart from that, everything about the film works - the script is sharp and well-written - Frank Cottrell Boyce has talent. Danny Boyle is the greatest British director - Ridley Scott was only born here (he uses American money, casts and crews now, and lives and films in America). But Danny Boyle proves that Britain has all the potential to make great films as well, and for that, I praise him. This is another classic under his name.

Millions might be a friendly family film, but it is a sharp and clever one, and one that is so original and enjoyable that you will enjoy watching it again and again. A stunning job! 10/10
