"Write On" was one of my childhood TV staples! TVO always had a knack of incorporating education into really bad story lines & characters. I guess you can say it's one of those classics that 30-somethings will never forget. That and "Math Patrol" or "Hilarious House of Frightenstein". I'm not quite sure if the latter actually taught us anything though.

Funny thing: I was recently watching "Dead Like Me" - episode "The Cook". I noticed that the waitress at Der Wafle Haus looked exactly like Miss Newton from "Write On" (about 30 years older, mind you). The cast list names the actress as "Deanne Henry". Could this really be "Dianne Dewey" of "Write On"???

Does anyone know what ever happened to Dianne Dewey (Miss Newton)?
