My 3 year old girl loves this movie, and I thought it was great too. There are lot's of little subtle things in the movie that you might not notice the first time through (I've seen it twice now, and liked it better the second time).

If you don't like cars or driving, you probably won't enjoy it as much as I did, but it's still a great movie.

For what it's worth, I'm not a NASCAR fan, nor do I follow any of the racing series (and haven't since I was a teenager), but I do enjoy driving, and I did belong to a Sports Car Club in college (and raced in Autocrosses and Road Rallies).
