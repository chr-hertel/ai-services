Oh my god! I love this film! The character Carrey creates is amazingly complex! It's beautiful to watch, poetry of the mind! Sweetly lovable but truly tragic, so many emotions! It's great! It really made me think about myself and I have a different look on life. I advise watching this before anyone tries to entertain with comedy, it's so original. The psychology also is perfectly portrayed, the character will make you think, feel pity, laugh inexplicably and long to be understood, just as Andy needs to be. I couldn't stop watching (as such I handed in some coursework late because for some reason it was on at about 11pm but it was worth it.)

BRILLIANT!!!
