I saw this film 20 years ago on with my friends. It is a wonderful film we still talk about it today with great fondness. This comedy starring John Mills is a credit to both the actors and the extremely talented Director Frank Nesbitt. We always wished to see this film again but although we all remembered this film in great detail as it is such a memorable film, the characters especially, John Mills who played Mr Parker we could not remember the title of the film. After all this time I am so happy I have finally found out the title. Dulcima is one of these masterpieces you should not miss. I will now find this film on D.V.D and I cannot wait to see the delight on my friend faces when it starts to play
