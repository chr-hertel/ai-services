Stewie Griffin: The untold Story was a moderately entertaining movie but it's not worth buying. It has it's moments but it is overall pointless. Family guy is a great show but this movie just does not do the show justice. Basically it was only three episodes of family guy and it ends there. there was no need for this to be a movie. It does not go as far as you might think. it's not inappropriate by the shows standards. in fact the new season of the show has gone farther than this Quoat UnQuoat movie did.

It's OK but it's nothing too special. If your not a fan of the show or have never seen it than just plain avoid this movie.

It could have been a hell of a lot better. I give it a five.
