Just watched the movie today and I have to say that I haven't seen such a good Eygptian movie in a very very long time. The rise of cheap comedy movies in recent years made me almost lose hope that we will ever watch something decent and well done. However, after watching Malkaky Iskendereya tonight, I was so impressed by the excellent direction of Sandra Nashaat and the amazing work by young actors and actresses who have been constantly contained in silly roles that hardly brought out whatever talent they possessed. Nour and Ghada Adel were exceptionally good..I honestly never saw Ghada as a good actress but once she was given a proper role to play, she shined! The photography was so adequate to the movie's plot and setting. Overall, this is a must see movie and a classic! Hoping to see more of these well directed/written/acted movies in the cinemas in the recent future.
