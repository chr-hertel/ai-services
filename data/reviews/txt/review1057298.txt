I am a avid Red Sox fan and I was excite for this movie ever since they were filming during the playoffs last year. This movie was made out to be the biggest blockbuster movie containing the Red Sox ever. In my opinion, IT FLOPPED BADLY. At no point in this movie did I laugh for an extended amount of time and the best part of the movie was watching the game. Jimmy Fallon was far from funny and Drew Barrymore is ..........nevermind. Anyway, I advise you see this if u get free tickets or sneak in free but do not pay. I bought tickets for this movie to try and sneak into Sin City, unfortunately I was caught and I was made to Fever Pitch. I was excited because it was a great back-up movie to see but they did a horrible job and the Farrely Brothers dropped a notch in my book.
