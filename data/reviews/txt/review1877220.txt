How is it possible that the director managed to make such a hash of this? Two of the most iconic sci fi creations to come out of Hollywood and he decides to place them in an episode of the OC. Why should we care about the ridiculous romantic sub plots and and lame teenage drama! I don't give a dam about the human relationships. They have absolutely no bearing on the plot!

The original movies, both Predator and Alien (and following Alien films) derived their tension from claustrophobic environments, and a small cast. It works. Hear that Hollywood? For this reason, among others, Predator 2 was not as good as the original. The first AvP film at least deserves some credit for realising this. In fact it's a masterpiece compared to this. As one reviewer already pointed out, this a business venture, nothing more. Even if they had ripped off the plot from AvP2 the PC game it would have made a far better movie. A movie of this poor quality doesn't deserve much of a review, and other reviewers have already detailed its many failings, pretty much all of which I would agree with.

Until they are prepared to make a no compromise, balls out film, slap an 18 certificate (r)and hand it to a director with a genuine passion for sci fi movies then please don't make any more.
