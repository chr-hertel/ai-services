The Rocky Horror Show (the musical play) debuted in 1973 and two years later, The Rocky Horror Picture was shown to the world. This bizarre cult favorite is one of the best movies I have ever seen (and I have seen MANY movies). My other favs include anything with Cary Grant, Gene Kelly, The Marx Brothers, Charlie Chaplin & other classics. Anyway, RHPS is still popular in this generation and continues to play weekly in many theaters (usually at midnight). Fans often attend viewings dressed as characters from the film and respond ritualistically to certain events by throwing food, using props, yelling jokes, dancing, and cheering. This movie has a lot of memorable songs and moments. IF YOU Haven't SEEN IT, SEE IT. YOU MUST GIVE YOURSELF OVER TO THIS ABSOLUTE PLEASURE!
