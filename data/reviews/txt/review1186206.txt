I watched this movie at home, on my home theater system. I wouldn't say this is the best Danish movie I've seen, but neither the worst. If you are in a lazy mood and just want to relax with a film and some popcorn before you head to bed, this movie might be the one to watch! The essence of the movie is "what to do, if you get a deadly disease and your days are numbered?" The movie is pretty much straight forward, but still makes you think of your own life and treasure it.

I liked this movie, because it is very much down to earth. However it's not a movie that I would watch twice, very mediocre. So as previously stated, if you want a nice film to relax to its pretty good, but if your inviting friends over for a blockbuster, you might want to show something else.
