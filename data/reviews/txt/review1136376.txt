There is a lot going on in this movie, and it requires repeated viewings. Mr. Lucas worked with Broadway playwright Tom Stoppard to add some grist to the dialog here, and it shows. This film is NOT for the younglings. This movie most definitely deserves its PG-13 rating. The content is dark, and violence, while well-edited and contained, is prominent. Having read the novelization, I am eager to see the deleted scenes in the DVD release. The acting, while still not up to its potential, has improved notably from that on display in Episodes 1 and 2. Mr. McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi) and Mr. McDiarmid (Chancellor Palpatine) are (in my opinion) highly worthy of Oscar nominations for their work here. A magnificent and emotionally overwhelming completion to this series. Highly recommended.
