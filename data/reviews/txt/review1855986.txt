I hate all the hype and build up for "monster" movies with all the trailers and promos and by the time I see the product of the babbling, it's too often a let down. And "Juno" was not a "monster" in respect to the scope of Hollywood standards because it was an indie. It wasn't made to dazzle but to tell a story, maybe moralize a little sometimes asking rhetorical questions and finally preaching to us subtlety that both good and bad decisions don't necessarily resolve into the exact dreams or nightmares we expect. Kind of like real-life.

"Juno", fortunately, was not one of those over-hyped let downs by my own standards and I was impressed by the delicate balance of scripting and excellent presentation by all the actors especially Ellen Page. I had previously run across her in "Hard Candy" which is equally as compelling for this young actress as she commands your attention with her delivery and expression and in this vehicle, she is no less engaging with the skill of a seasoned veteran in a role.

It's a story about a teen but is far superior to any teen movie I've ever viewed. I recall "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" from years ago with the very serious undercarriage of moral dilemmas mixed with humor and reality. "Juno" took a good "teen" movie the step further with a slightly more complex tact but just as entertaining.
