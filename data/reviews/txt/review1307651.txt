The acting is good all around, with Matt Dillon being the best in my opinion. However the movie throws too many characters at us expecting us to care about them after a few minutes on screen. The repeated interactions between the same characters in different situations and times in the movie seem forced. It is more a collection of very short stories with characters in common. It was very predictable, for me at least, especially when the characters are "forced" to interact with each other trying to show how they have changed, or not changed for that matter. There were a few interesting developments I did enjoy, but over all I was very disappointed with the movie. That said I am sure many people will like Crash. It just seems like if you say you don't people think of you as a racist.
