Pepper Dennis is the best show I've seen in years! 

The characters are great! And the chance meeting of Pepper and Charlie in the first show is a switch from usual story lines. You have to wait for the 3rd season to see the main characters together!

I just can't say enough good things about this show. I love every character except the new station manager. He's too much of a goof, but I guess he blends in more for the comedy of the show than the old station manager.

Pepper Dennis the serious reporter that always seems to run in to a snag. The cast of her sister, cameraman, make-up woman and the rest of her family all work very well together. Not to mention Charlie!

I hope this show is renewed and is on for a very, very long time!
