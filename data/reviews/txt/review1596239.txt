If you go into this move looking for Anthony Hopkins, you will be disappointed. But, if you go in looking for Hannibal Lechtor, you won't be. You can't compare this movie to any other Hannibal movie. Different time-period, different setting, different actors......

My point is, the actor that played Hannibal did beautifully. It was very effective in scaring the ***** out of me! But, no, you can't compare Anthony Hopkins to Hanibal Rising. Totally different. 

And, yes, it was a total explanation as to why he turned out the way he did. 

I'm waiting for the next one.
