This movie is simple, light-minded amusement that's geared for a young audience (maybe 10-13 year old kids). If you happen to be a snowboarder, there's a lot of early snowboarding material that's sort of amusing to watch.

Basically, the story is about a group of snowboarders trying to get the right to use the slopes at a ski resort. To do this, they have to succeed on two fronts - they must make set up a successful beginner snowboard school and win a race against skiers.

Jim Varney does his normal zany, incompetent and innocent character role and Brigitte Nielsen does a good job in a "bad girl" role. Everyone else is pretty much acting out one-dimensional character roles.

The one mildly redeeming value of this movie is the winter scenery - instead of occasionally seeing some snow and skiing / snowboarding, there's quite a bit of it. The value is 'historical' only: it's the mid-90s and snowboarding is just becoming mainstream - the tricks are nice (not flashy and insane as they are now) and skis are still long and straight. The snow scenes are kind of amusing for those reasons.

However, if that is not of interest and you are not a little child, watch this in the background while you do something else or not at all.
