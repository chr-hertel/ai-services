This is the worst movie I've seen in years. Name the clich√©--this movie has it: Rugged yet cynical and washed-up bad boy pilot who inexplicably gains the admiration of his crew and the affection of the pretty girl... People beating forces of nature through optimism and teamwork... Cloaked barbarians who ride over the ridge just as the courageous Westerners are trying to make an escape... Brainy know-it-all whose lack of empathy threatens to destroy the group...

I feel like I've seen this movie before. It's the distillation of everything Hollywood has done wrong in the last 50 years.

It looks like Dennis Quaid has fallen pretty far in the 20 years since The Right Stuff. He's as washed up as the character he portrays. Still, he must be pretty flattered that this entire movie seems to be built around that character, thin personality and all.
