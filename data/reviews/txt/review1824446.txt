i am a teenager; I'm 15. I'm also a lover of most action/adventure movies. i am however, not accustomed to liking movies that i consider "ancient." the only reason i really watched this movie, was because it was during summer break and my dad would only allow me to get what he considered a "classic" that week. boy was i amazed when i discovered what a classic really was. this movie appeals to just about any fan base; young or old, male or female, because of its engrossing plot line and fantastic acting. the action will keep you on the edge of your seat, while the plot will keep you glued there for fear of missing something. basically, this movie is just amazing
