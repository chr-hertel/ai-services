I just checked out YouTube and found out that one of the sites there I subscribed to had put this Herschell Gordon Lewis flick on there today (or yesterday since it's now a few hours the next day). This is the first time I've seen one of this guy's movies in its entirety. While I did find the gore a little shocking, it was also very obvious how theatrically creative (in other words, a little fake) many of those scenes were. One of those scenes, by the way, I recognized in the movie Juno when that character and the one played by Jason Bateman were watching it on TV. While I recognized how amateurish the acting was, I did like the campy performance of one Ray Sager as the notorious Montag the Magnificent. Many of his line readings made me laugh so much! The leading lady as a TV personality and the leading man as a sportscaster actually weren't bad either. Despite some of the acting, the story was pretty good until the end, when, well, whatever logic you expected was very much thrown out the window and you're left saying huh? With all that said, I was pretty entertained by The Wizard of Gore. I guess now, I've gotta find another HGL flick to satisfy my curiosity. Maybe another one will be posted on YouTube or Google Video soon...
