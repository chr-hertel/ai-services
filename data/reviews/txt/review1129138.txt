This film was a bit too low-key for my taste (that may well just be me).

There was very little that made me laugh out loud, but there were some things that were ongoing comedic touches that were regularly humorous (Cate Blanchett chewing gum comes to mind). 

Very quirky, not a "laugh a minute" comedy (and it doesn't claim to be that). 

Nice music (quirky too), interesting effects. But you have to be in the mood for this one, IMO.

Apparently I have to write more. Interesting to see Owen Wilson playing a different sort of part - I wonder if Jeff Goldblum will ever do that? William Dafoe plays a very uncharacteristic role too - and is funny in that.
