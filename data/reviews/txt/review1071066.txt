Strong well delivered dialog start off this fully realized tapestry of characters and situations.

The cinematographers use of Falls vibrant hues add a nice touch to some creatively framed shots. Small things that might get overlooked like a scene where two actors converse on a bench and the American flag waves proudly in a windows reflection are a delight.

The score is a wonderful compliment to the visuals and really sets the movies tone.

On the fringe is a nice little indie movie that isn't so small. It's amazing how much of the town the film makers must have covered. Lot's of exterior shots that really showoff the small town landscape.
