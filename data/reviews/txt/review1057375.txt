I have had this movie for around a year now, and i didn't really get around to watching it, and one sleepless night I put it on.

I was hooked from around the first 5 minutes of watching it. I fell in love with the character's & the story line, and at the end, I was in tears.

The movie is one of the greatest movie's that has not been publicised as much as any other. I was broken hearted like no other movie had made me feel. I love this movie dearly & i recommend it to ANYONE. I didn't think i would like it by the cover but don't let that deceive you.

This movie is excellent!.
