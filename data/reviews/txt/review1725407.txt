The very talented Jeremy Sisto let his hair grow long in 2003 to play the pleasant but delusional hero of THE MOVIE HERO. Sisto imagines he is constantly performing before an audience that only he can see, and he imagines he is a hero looking for a villain to defeat. He finds his nemesis in the versatile Peter Stormare as an apparent serial killer. Along the way, he also picks up a sidekick (Antoin Thompson). The one problem is, he is an unemployed 20-something whose parents are always hoping for better from him. He eventually ends up in the office of a therapist (Dina Meyer of STARSHIP TROOPERS) whom he imagines is his "love interest." Some of this stuff is very funny, but most of the film is a series of closeups of the actors speaking directly into the camera, and they clearly were working with no budget to speak of. It shows. Worth a look by the cineaste, not the mainstream viewer.
