With this movie, I was very glad to see how the quality of Russian production finally approaches the best world standards. I mean, there always have been geniuses in Russian cinema, but one cannot live on caviar - needs daily bread, too. This action shows a young professional boxer who loses his vision and then must save the world and his love. And blind he does. I would like to invite visitors to see pictures from the movie and watch a detailed trailer at RussArt.com. Those who read Russian can find more materials useful: reviews, actor biographies, articles, etc.
