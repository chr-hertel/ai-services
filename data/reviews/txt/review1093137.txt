Patrick Moug's The Ugly One was a unique and fresh take on a much-used genre. Horror movies can be a dime-a-dozen, but this one combined a creepy vibe as well as an intelligent storyline. The movie had great production values and used varied and interesting locations, creating an atmosphere of a much bigger budget movie. I was impressed by the use of so many outdoor settings without the washed out look that normally comes with these kinds of shots. The night shots must have been very difficult to get as well. The use of digital film enhanced the professional feel of this movie. The plot was surprising and well thought out. The score was professional and well suited to the plot purposes. 

I'm looking forward to seeing what comes next from this talented filmmaker.
