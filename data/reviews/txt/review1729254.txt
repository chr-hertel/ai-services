Anytime there's a movie based on a historical figure, one hopes to gain an insight into the individual or an important event that he/she was involved with. If you know nothing about what happened to Pinochet, you'll learn a little (but very little) from this movie.

Basically, it's about 'retired' Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet's unexpected arrest in England during a vacation. The story covers a brief period of about 2 years.

Unfortunately, there's not much to tell - or learn from this movie except for a little bit of history and some minor characterization. You don't really get to know Pinochet much at all. In 1 1/4 hours of storytelling, not a whole lot happens either.

If you don't know about about Pinochet's arrest and are interested in it, this movie can give you some information about it - but you won't get much else.
