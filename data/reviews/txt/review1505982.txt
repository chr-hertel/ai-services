I've never seen a movie from the Netherlands before ... most Scandinavian movies I've seen have been dark, depressing, full of existential angst ... this movie is quite fun, kind of weird ... extremely well-acted (even with sub-titles) ... a very pleasant surprise.

Actually, I wrote the preceding before the movie turned really dark ... depressing ... full of existential angst ...

they are all the same ... still worth watching though ...

i think they should do an American remake with kevin federline as the man, rosie o'donnell as his wife, and courtney love as the tutor/love interest. is that enough lines?
