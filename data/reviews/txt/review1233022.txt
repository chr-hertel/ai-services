I love this show, it keeps me wanting more............................ After coincidently watching the commercial for this show, i was hooked. The first episode wasn't that bad as i got to now all the characters. Many people say its not correct as its meant to be, and i say sooo.... how many Caeser films or historical films are there in total? if all of them would be the same, how boring would that be. For example how many Cinderella films are there? More than 10 i can tell you. Their not all the same though, or else what would be the point in making a new one. This show is meant to be entertaining not exactly like its history. Besides who knows if the real history of Caeser is actually all real??? No one can really prove that. Lately on the TV there aren't many olden days films or shows, thats why i was surprised and hooked when i saw this show.

Even if people don't like the show as much i reckon all the actors put in their best performance to make the 'empire' a really successful show. I really enjoy having Jonathan Cake as the sexy gladiator. At times the film is a bit difficult to understand, but once you start watching it you get really into it. I've only seen two episodes and i already love it. I was a bit disappointed on the character that plays Octavious (Santiago Cabrera) as he isn't as strong and convincing, but then again I'm sure he will start to grow and develop as the show continuous. We also have to think that he is a teenager or a young adult in the film and at the moment he is a bit confused, but later on he will probably gain confidence and become a good ruler, i doubt that the director would have picked a bad or weak actor to do this show. Maybe its all part of the film.I probably would recommend a bit more romance and a bit more action. but I still think it deserves a 10/10, at least for Jonathan, who is an eye catching actor....
