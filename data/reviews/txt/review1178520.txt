I was extremely disappointed with this version of P&P, the producers really couldn't have picked a worse actress to play the role of Lizzy. Elizabeth Bennett is the most sensible of all the sisters, yet Keira attempted to play her as she does all her other characters - cute and silly, it DID NOT work. Even the costumes seemed out of place on her anorexic frame, could they not at least have given her a wonder-bra, or even some socks?

Darcy came across more as a sulky teenager than an English Gentleman and MacFadyen does not possess the same air of dignity and grace that is Colin Firth. In the true story, Elizabeth's love for Darcy developed so gradually, yet here it progressed too quickly and therefore spoilt the whole general feeling and suspense of the story. The film altogether was rushed through at an alarming pace without the viewer ever really getting to know a character, and the whole 'Lydia saga' seemed to be resolved and forgotten in a matter of hours. 

The language jumped and interchanged from the original script to modern English, even during the same conversations, resulting in a very confusing mess. This was especially apparent in the first proposal from Darcy, which was so cringe-worthy I could barely stop myself from covering my ears and running out of the cinema.

This film was cast, produced and directed so poorly, I beg everyone to read the book or watch the original in order to enjoy this fabulous story and leave this pure Americanised trash where it belongs.
