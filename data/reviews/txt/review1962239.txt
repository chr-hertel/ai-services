Chad (Peter Brown) and Joe (William Smith) trick Reese (Neville Brand) into volunteering for a "special assignment" - cleaning out the stable. Then, Parmalee (Philip Carey) lets Chad and Joe go out on the more desirable task of securing an army payroll. After Chad and Joe lose the payroll to French soldiers, Reese joins them in fighting for its recovery. His fellow Rangers dupe Reese into believing that, following the mission, he is to receive the "Governor's Gold Medal", for bravery... 

This episode is strong on characterization, but sloppily staged.
