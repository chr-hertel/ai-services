Jamie Foxx channels Ray Charles and has him down cold in this high budget biopic that is worth watching for the music alone. Taylor Hackford takes us through Ray Charles life from his early childhood days before he lost his site and periods of his life in the 50's and 60's at the height of his stardom.

Ray's life was all over the map. He suffered all his life from witnessing the death of his brother, he had an ongoing drug habit that almost wrecked his life, and he had numerous infidelities. He had two main constants going for him. His wife Bea and his music. The movie takes us through all those times and sometimes to a fault as it moves a little too slowly at times.

The movie works on two levels. The amazing performance of Jamie Foxx, who put his heart and soul into this role and the music which accompanies the film. For fans of Ray Charles, you have yourself a wonderful soundtrack.

I don't think this movie necessarily deserved an Oscar nomination for best picture but it is very entertaining and you'll certainly enjoy it. (***1/2)
