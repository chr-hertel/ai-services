My wife loved the book and told me about the outrageousness of the X's and the jabs that the observant narrator made about their empty lives. The film is a huge disappointment - a retread Mary Poppins with a "Let's go fly a kite" happy ending. The talent is completely wasted - Giamatti and Linney are very good and could have done much more with the characters had they been allowed to. Johannsen is miscast - the narrator is way too milquetoast and passive for her. It seemed like she had to grit her teeth to say her lines.

My only explanation is that the people who made this movie were like the X's - completely oblivious. If only people would follow family values, work hard so their kids get a proper education so they could marry above their station - the world would be a better place. That's what Mrs X and her book club would have gotten out of the book (after extensive introspective analysis) and apparently so did their filmmaker friends...
