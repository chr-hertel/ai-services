In reference to Elentari's query about why this film appeared on TV in B&W - it was a common practice for early TV to have prints that were in B&W even if it was originally a color theatrical release - usually in the era before color TV - it would have been cheaper to produce B&W film prints. These were generally 16mm prints released to the TV studios in B&W. Some of these "TV Prints" still survive in collector's hands today. African Queen was made in the Technicolor process and all theatrical screenings would have been in color. Generally speaking it is possible to tell which (originally b&w prints) have been "colorised". They have an un-natural appearance about them, and there is a general repetition of the same color - example hats, coats, cars, all seem to the one shade of brown, or all vegetation seems to be the one shade of green. In artificial colorization prints there is not the subtle tonings of different shades of color associated with natural (original) color productions.
