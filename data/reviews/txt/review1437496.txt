"Pop Rocks" tells us the story of Dagger, the lead singer of a death metal band Rock Toxin that disbanded twenty years ago, who's living a normal family life after that. But former bandmates pursue him for a reunion gig, but he must keep it secret from his family that he was actually 'Dagger'. Thus the comedy begins.

I actually liked the basic plot quite much. It has got an unusual premise with enough scopes for funny moments. There are actually some quite entertaining situations. But then the film started preaching family values too much and got down to that average TV-movie standard. Another potential for a really unusual film wasted. I agree that some idealism has to be shown in a family drama but this is quite blatant and thats's why the screenplay also suffered from a lot of cheesy material.
