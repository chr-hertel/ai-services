Jackie Chan (Rush Hour) and Jet Li (Hero) team up in Rob Minkoff's fantasy adventure about a teenager who is brought to a kingdom to return a magical staff to an ancient warrior to restore peace and harmony.

In the run up to this film, there was the much anticipated pairing of two of Chinese cinemas finest actors in Chan and Li and neither disappointed in a good fantasy adventure.

Though the plot runs on a few clichés, it is exciting, tense and intriguing viewing with usual Chinese cinema style fighting, very fast and flowing, chases and amazing effects to conform to the genre, and also a bit of humour as well. There were moments when you may feel yourself turning away as a cliché becomes unbelievably corny and predictable but the fights and plot will have your eyes glued to the screen for almost 2 hours of running time.

The direction by Minkoff is good, bizarre but intriguing in justifying the character's actions and reactions. I've personally never been a big fan of CGI, but when used here is used to maximum effect making it a spectacle of bright lights and magic.

I wondered after watching; whether the film would have been better in Chinese with subtitles, just to add a bit more intensity and surprise to certain scenes, just an after thought really. But still good in English, all actors did well, though Angarano plays a complete teenage stereotype I found it embarrassing to watch at some points.

Though critics have said the plot does follow an American young hero who must save the day and defeat the odds etc, there is still magic and interest to the tale, plus the choreography and visual effects add to the intensity of the situations and if you look past all the clichés then it is an enjoyable fighting fantasy film.
