We have 4 children between 5 and 11 and it is difficult to find a movie that we all enjoy. Duma did the tick and we spent a wonderful evening together.

The characters are deep enough to make them credible and stimulating some thoughts: is Ripkuna good or bad? why does the buy run away from him? why does the boy fight with his mother?

It has beautiful images, a great story, leaves a strong message (growing, changing and leaving is part of life)...in short a wonderful movie.

I am surprised that I had not heard of it at all before "stumbling" into it at the local DVD rental shop.
