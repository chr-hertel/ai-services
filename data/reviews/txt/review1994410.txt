when i first saw kingdom of heaven, i saw the original version, and i was quite disappointed. i would rate it 6/10. then i found an extended edition, and i read a review that said it was better. so yesterday i turned it on, and my expectations wasn't exactly high. the extended version is an epic masterpiece of a movie. there is so many other characters you get to know, and many other stories about the characters. the extended version lasts about an hour longer, so there is quite a lot of new material you get to see. if you are a fan of medieval movies, they i strongly advice you to watch this movie. it is absolutely stunning.
