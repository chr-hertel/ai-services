A truly brilliant story, filmed in a truly brilliant fashion with truly brilliant acting by esp. Russell Crowe & Jennifer Connelly :) Very hard to top this movie for those fans who consider themselves to be(semi)intellectuals :) The complex subject of schizophrenia is explained in a way I have never seen before. Around this central theme, another very moving story evolves of true love by an incredibly courageous & wise partner as played very convincingly by Jennifer Connelly. The special traditions and customs of a typical upper class University add yet another fine flavor to this superb movie. Well deserved awards, but too few as Russell Crowe is simply magnificent :)
