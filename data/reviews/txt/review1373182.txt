I found this movie to be outstanding. Maybe it was because my expectations were very low - but I was so pleasantly surprised. I thought Hanks pulled off Robert Langdon - even if it wasn't one of his most memorable roles. I thought the supporting cast was outstanding, and the movie was surprisingly true to the book.

My wife, who had never read the book, thought it was great as well. She was very intrigued by the story line, and like most people who read the book, she came home and started researching some of the basis of the movie to see how much was factual and how much was just entertainment. 

I read an article that talked about the term "Faction" - a mixture of facts and fiction that make a novel more appealing. I think Mr. Brown has discovered the magic recipe for faction and will continue to thrill readers for many years.

Film critics do not seem to represent the American public in any way and therefor serve no purpose.
