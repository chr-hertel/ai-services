This may be the most realistic movie I've ever seen. The acting and cinematography make it seem like it was filmed while it the actual events occurred. Pontecorvo couldn't have made a better film. Forget Spielberg and Scorsese. Forget Hollywood. This is real cinema.

It's a documentary style movie, and it will teach you something. Beyond that, it will make you FEEL something. That's what movies are supposed to do, right? Pontecorvo knows the answer to that. At the end of this film, you'll say to yourself 'Wow! Now that's how a movie should be made.' 

Colonialism and oppression have a tremendous affect on people. Watching this movie, you will see exactly how.
