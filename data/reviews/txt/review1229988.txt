This documentary presents the life and death of Lampião, his wife Maria Bonita and his group of hit men called "Cangaceiros", with footages, pictures and testimonies of persons that have had some sort of contact with him, including the man who killed Lampião.

Paulo Gil Soares released this short using footages from "Lampião, o Rei do Cangaço"of Benjamin Abrahão. The intention of Benjamin was to make a documentary about Lampião, as a symbol of a problem in the Brazilian society and a challenge to the State. He followed Lampião and his group, but when the 100 minutes running time movie was ready (1936), the D.I.P.  censorship of the Brazilian Estado Novo (New State)  destroyed the film. However, many negatives survived. In the 50s, a former employee of D.I.P. sold these negatives to the production of "Comendo de Colher"(1959). Paulo Gil Soares retrieved these negatives and prepared a 10 minutes cut about Lampião. My vote is seven.

Title (Brazil): "Memória do Cangaço" ("Memories of the Cangaço")
