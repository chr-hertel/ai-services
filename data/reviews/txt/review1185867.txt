Man, does this guy know how to write or what? In this film, Joss Whedon shows us a real future. It's not sanitized like Star Trek -- there's no warp drive, no aliens. It's just us humans. Serenity escapes a rut that a lot of sci-fi television has gotten into. By discarding many stereotypical sci-fi elements, Joss has gotten to the heart of any good story: the characters. Serenity's ensemble cast is truly spectacular. The actors must have been born for these roles. When Serenity is over, you won't want to leave. You will be left wanting more, and this film is rare in that the fans have had such an important part in its creation. If Serenity does well in the box office, reaching $80 million, the sequels will get green-lighted. Take a chance and see this wonderful movie, it does not disappoint!
