I loved this movie. This is second best Disney movie in my history. It's beautiful and reflect how sweet or bitter friendship in your life. Remy as a mouse trying to break rule to be success in different way like other mouses, A young man search for self confidence by accidentally met Remy who taught him lessons to gain it. But life itself somehow become complicated and you have to choose. With jazzy upbeat music score and song, this movie is entertaining. It's better than the Incredible with more personality and funnier. Director Brad Bird once again bring the true honest and beautiful meaning of memorable cartoon character. Recommended for all ages for make you laugh till cry.
