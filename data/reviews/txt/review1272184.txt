A group of friends on their way to a wedding get lost in the vast Midwest,and are forced to stop for the night in the quiet little town of Lovelock.The friendly innkeeper,Mr.Wise(David Carradine),shows them their rooms then promptly drops dead the next day,forcing the group to stay in town during the investigation.But while the local sheriff does his work,a mysterious force sweeps the town,turning its residents into murderous zombies."Dead and Breakfast" is a vastly entertaining zombie flick filled with amusing jokes and gore.The make-up effects are some of the best I have ever seen,especially when Erik Palladino is dancing around with a chainsaw grinding into his neck,or when the top half of a zombie's head is removed.The combination of humour,gore,and good old fashioned zombie horror gloss make "Dead & Breakfast" one of the finest horror films of 2004.The cast is okay and the action is never dull.If you enjoyed "Evil Dead 2" or "Braindead" give this film a chance.7 out of 10.
