Eve's Bayou is a skillful combination of exquisite melodrama and character study, superbly written and directed by Kasi Lemmons, who was only a first time director in 1997 when this film was released. The story builds beautifully from character and incident, and some may argue with Lemmons' sense of pace but any time saved there would jeopardize the extremely intricate set of relationships and story possibilities. Each character is a point on this massive web that she has spun, and each scene gives us another small piece of this painting. To her great credit, Lemmons handles the material with great subtlety, ensuring that only the right kind of sensationalism appears on screen Â– the kind that that we decode ourselves through the pain-racked faces and tear-filled eyes of her characters.

It's a superb cast and they all stretch a bit to go places of great inner pain. But if this makes the film sound a heavy, desperate affair, it isn't meant to. They are intoxicating performances that touch us on every level. Wonderful production design and cinematography, and Lemmons' touch extends to the music(scored by Terrance Blanchard). Enthralling from start to finish, Eve's Bayou holds many secrets and leaves much to be digested.
