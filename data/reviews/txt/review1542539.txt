Holy crap!!!!!!!! This movie is amazing!!!!!!!!!!! It has a lot of action......... a lot of action, a great story that is true to the comic book, and great acting. Frank Castle is an FBI agent. During an undercover operation, a mob boss's son is killed. The mob boss seeks revenge and kills Castle's entire family at a reunion. Frank Castle barely survives and seeks to punish the mob boss for what he did. He gets an apartment and tracks down the mob boss to punish him. This movie is so good!!!! I think Thomas Jane was perfect for Frank Castle. And John Travolta made a very good Howard Saint (mob boss) I cannot wait for The Punisher 2: War Zone!!!

Amazing movie!!!!!!!!!! especially the extended director's cut. It adds to the story more and gets more in depth with Frank Castle.

definitely recommend it!!!!
