So I've seen all 12 episodes now and all I can say is after I saw the last episode I left the living room with a big smile.

I'd never thought a show like this could possibly be this good. It was pretty hard to being obsessed after the first episodes but after about episode five you just can't wait for more. I really enjoyed Dexter. The last episode I was all "How is this going to end?" and keep asking myself of how this thing is going to be ended in fifty minutes.

I'm not gonna spoil anything but Dexter is a really great show and I really wished there were more episodes in the first season and Michael Hall is a great actor and Dexter is a great character and the way he manages to make up great lies.

Anyway, this deserves so many Golden Globes you couldn't even imagine. A really great TV-show! =D
