In one of the many Looney Tunes WWII-themed cartoons, a cat invades a house inhabited by mice and gets them to appease him. But when it becomes clear that he has no desire other than to eat them, they see it as their patriotic duty to defend themselves.

What I mean by associating "The Fifth-Column Mouse" with "Animal House" is that not only is the house inhabited by non-human fauna, but that dog-looking tank was sort of like the Deathmobile from which John Belushi emerged dressed as a pirate.

I'm probably the only person who would think that. Heck, I'm apparently the first person reviewing this cartoon. Do I like it? Well, I consider the cartoon worth seeing. It's an OK, not great cartoon. Featured in "Bugs and Daffy: The Wartime Cartoons".
