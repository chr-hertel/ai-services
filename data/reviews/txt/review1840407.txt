You can have the Will Smith version, but this is the original based upon Richard Matheson's novel I am legend, and with his screenplay.

Starring the master of terror, Vincent Price, trying to stay alive and kill as many vampires as he can before they kill him.

He even finds a dog, but it is infected. he finds a woman (Franca Bettoia), and she is infected, but has a serum.

It is a bleak and depressing story as should be for someone living alone and lost in memories of what was, and getting up to do the same things every single day.

A Price classic!
