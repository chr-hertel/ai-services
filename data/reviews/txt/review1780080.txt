Now this is the one Adam Sandler movie I do not get the rating off I mean if people like stuff like chuck and Larry and Happy Gilmore then why the hell do they not like this. Anyway the movie centers around Nicky a very geeky devils son who is sent on a mission to get his evil brother back for his Daddy Satan. The film is a must watch for Adam Sandler fans and just goes to show that people take movies too seriously now days like Adam Sandler movies are meant to be watched and after you watch them you are meant to say "man that was a no brain comedy". Overall watch this movie for a laugh and not particularly for anything else. I rate this film a fair 73% for making me laugh.
