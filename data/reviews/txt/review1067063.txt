my last review was about a movie i viewed at age ten (that one, mondo cane, 1962) affected my life "quite a bit". here, at age twenty, my horizons are all aglow with lust for life; and one little slide into an economy cambridge, massachusetts movie theatre during a 1972 midday special brought me upon the magus. the interesting setting mixed with an odd tension unlike i've ever experienced in any movie before (and i am an old movie buff: 1935 to 1975 being my strength) made me short of breath, my heart pounding hard as the depths drawn upon by these too quite favorite (not quite most-favorite, but favorites, none-the-less) actors thrust me into an experience that unbeknownst to me was perhaps two weeks away from presenting itself to me! so i drank thirstily from the cup, completely unaware that the lesson it would introduce to my mind could actually come in handy. i still look back at the odd role-reversing theories it employed, and utilize the intended juxtapositional ideology as an everyday tool/ instrument/ weapon/ defense... oh, heck: simply put, it's more like "you thought you had me! well, now i have you, and i surrender, so now you have me only because i agree to empower you!"...mmm, yeah, i'd say that could about sum it up.
