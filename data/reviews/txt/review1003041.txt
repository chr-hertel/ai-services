I saw the movie on DVD...I have no good comments for the movie in general. Especially, the scene of the brutal, horrific, terrible murder in the gay club was unbelievable. I haven't seen such a scene on a movie. Logically, this movie should not be allowed to people under the age of 18...Nothing more than sex, drugs and extreme violence. I can't understand how the director put such a brutal and nasty scene(death in gay club) on the movie...it was a real shock for me. The only good of the movie was..Monica Bellucci who is really beautiful...However, the whole film(classical French crap) is about rapes, sexual language and brutality.
