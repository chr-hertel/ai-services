All of the major characters had extreme depth to them (even some of the minor characters had amazing depth). Some of the best acting I've ever seen in a movie. Heath Ledgers joker easily matches Jack Nicholson's performance in The Shining (1980) and quite possibly surpasses it.

Great storyline and lots of twists and turns, completely unpredictable ones too. The whole movie is action packed. There's quite a good comedic element to the movie as well.

All in all one of the best movies ever (maybe not as good as The Godfather but is very close) and it will be making you want to watch it again and again just to catch all of those minor details you might have missed the first, second, or third time you saw it.
