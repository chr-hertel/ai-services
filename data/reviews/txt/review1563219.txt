This German film was very well done. Kudos to it's young Director Marco Kreuzpaintner for making a film with an emotionally serious underlying message and wrapping it all up in a cute entertaining well crafted package. Summer Storm is about THE summer that champion rower Tobi (Robert Stadlober) comes to the terms with his homosexuality and the temporary upheaval that it creates for him and all those around him. The metaphor of the Summer Storm that swoops in and turns everything upside down was a smart idea. Summer Storm reminded me a lot of the French film Wild Reeds Directed by Andre Techine which is more like a Summer Hurricane but hey to each his own. For some people the experience is a storm, for others a hurricane and for some maybe even a super nova.
