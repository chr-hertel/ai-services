left me speechless at the end of the movie.

overall, in my opinion, the movie gets 5 out of 10. 1 because i'm a Korean. plus 1 because i want Korean movies to succeed overseas. plus 1 because the CG is not too bad. plus 1 because it's little better than the previous movie by Shim. last plus 1 is added because i'm a Korean.

now about the movie.. storyline interruptions and inconsistency between the scenes are not really noticeable due to bad actings. also i've never seen director's comments(documentary) in the ending credits. only good part about the movie are the in-city fighting scenes.

since i consider myself to be a patriot, i refuse to comment more in detail about the movie.

only warn others to not have high expectations before going to see the movie.
