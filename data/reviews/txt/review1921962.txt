Ed Edd n Eddy has got to be one of my favorite and the most funniest cartoon ever. It was one of the originals or Cartoon Cartoons. I loved every episode and just couldn't get enough of it. It made you laugh til you fell off a chair or something. I used to laugh hard on this show and little did I know that I would be obsessed with it. I also liked watching the marathons also like Ed-dependence Day back in July 2001 or The best day Edder. I really liked it a lot. Today I wish Cartoon Network would re-air the old and new episodes again. I got Season 2 and 3 on my computer and it still makes me laugh.

I feel sorry for kids these days who haven't watched this state-of-the-art funniest show on television.

10/10 and still laughing...
