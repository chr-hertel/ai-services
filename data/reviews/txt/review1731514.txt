I've seen the pilot and have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. It's true that the writing could be better, but I'm sure that will improve as everyone on the show limbers up for the job. I'm glad that NBC did the show instead of SciFi - the effects are good, the cast has some budget behind it (which makes a huge difference in terms of quality), and if you're a fan of BSG you'll get to see some of your favorite character actors from that show as well.

I'm a fan of this kind of show (Buffy, Dark Angel, Nikita, etc.) and think that the pilot promises that the new Bionic Woman will easily be just as good as Dark Angel, Nikita, and Alias (and probably better than all three). It would need a radical overhaul of the writing staff to be as good as Buffy, and some Jaime-allies to round out the ensemble.

Overall, I highly recommend that you tune in for at least the first three episodes - I think this might be really good.
