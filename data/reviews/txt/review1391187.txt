I saw this movie at the Waterfront Film Festival, and I loved it! The story is set in 1995, with an incredible soundtrack from all the "alternative rock" bands of that year, and the characters are well-developed and believable. The story centers around three friends who are brought together to attend the funeral of a friend from high school. Kip Pardue and Eddie Kaye Thomas are both very good, but the surprise performance for me was given by Josh Cooke. He gives an amazing performance as a self-destructive rebel in this film, and I hope to see more of his performances in the future. See this movie as soon as possible.
