Now I may seem rude or even out of my mind to say that this movie isn't scary! I find it hard to even consider a so called "jumper" movie, but then again I saw teenagers in the theaters jumping out of their seats and spilling pop corn on the floor. But maybe I'm the only person who remembers that Sutherland and Spacek are part of horror movie alumni. Sissy Spacek's unforgettable turn as Carrie in the 1972 film and Sutherland in the remake of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers". If you want to see something scary, then go to a video store and rent some vintage heart pounding movies.

Now kudos to last years "Exorcism of Emily Rose" and both "Exorcist Beginning"'s, ghost and exorcism are all the rage. But not like anyone really wanting to see this filth has taken the time to look at Friedkin's SCARY (gasp) "Exorcist" where it all began. But the story focuses on a few people where creepy things and ghastly specters run amok leading to a death. 

A overdone story line with the same old tricks, if anything a laugh out loud spook-fest. Skip this at all costs
