We saw this movie at an IMAX. It was amazing to say the least. Whoever calls it "brainwashing" obviously didn't understand the real message, being that the Colorado River must be protected. If not for anything else, this movie is worth your time for the funky Dave Matthews tunes and the stunning scenic cinematography. Whether you get the chance to see this film at an IMAX (preferably), or at a conventional theater, you will, considering you have an open mind and a love for nature and all its amazing wonders like the Grand Canyon, certainly not be disappointed. These film makers are not trying to brainwash anybody. They have a passion for protecting our environment and have expressed that brilliantly through this film. I highly recommend it!
