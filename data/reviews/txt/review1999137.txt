What can I say about this film? There are certainly many stars in this one. Jack Black, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, and Angelina Jolie just to name a few. But that doesn't always been a good movie. It has to have a good plot and this one actually does.

Looking for the "Dragon Warrior" (yes, very clich√©), a furry animal warrior is sought. And Jack Black's overweight panda is found. With no kung fu experience, he is looked down upon by others. But yet a miracle takes place.

This actually is somewhat of a fun movie. I know many CGI films that just bust, but this not only had star power but a good plot as well.

So overall, its good. "B"
