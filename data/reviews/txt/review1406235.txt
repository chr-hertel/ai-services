Obviously the affects are better and keeping the original soundtrack was a true blessing that saved the movie from being a complete lackluster.

Bryan Singer avoided quite a few of the clich√©s of the first Richard Donner Superman...but his avoiding of the created a drone-like performance.

Missing was the colorful Perry White, played by a going-thru-the motions Frank Langella...

Who ever thought of casting Kate Bosworth...who by the way is FREASKISHLY too thin.

Spacey's performance was uninspired and he was severely underused.

Parker Posey as is half witted partner in crime was just completely miscast...she just was not right for the role.

Just bad...what helped this movie was that it tried to keep a lot of elements of the original 1978 movie...otherwise this film could not possibly stand on it's own.

Save your money...wait for the DVD and hope the sequel is not as bad.
