I was impressed with this movie for many reasons: The talent was brilliant, taking this film from good to great. The story was unique and entertaining, while remaining unpredictable. The filming was very well done. I enjoyed traveling along with the characters and watching the scenery. 

The female lead plays a mistreated woman who's ready to take over the power in this twisted relationship. I think there is a lot of truth to her situation and most will find it very relatable. Thank you to the makers of this film, I really enjoyed watching it.
