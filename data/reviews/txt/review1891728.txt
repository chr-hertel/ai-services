This is one of those films that really gets you thinking for weeks, think Donnie Darko, think Donnie Darko.

It also seemed to build an inner confidence i never knew i had.

After the final shot where the Panda wins the bet and walks off with the hottie i set out to buy myself a giant wood-lice costume from www.youwilllookatwat.co.uk and got into character as soon as i got home.

I then spend the rest of my evening chewing the mdf backing on my wifes wardrobe which seemed to turn her on.

The rest of the evening was a blur and she is no longer talking to me but what i am trying to say is that dressing as a strange animal can have some very beneficial effects.

Love it.
