For me a good comedy is one which makes me laugh, a good drama one which makes me weep or at least feel a lump in my throat, a message movie one which makes me feel the message and agree with it and a horror movie one which scares me indeed. Well this movie scared me enough though not too much. Its slow rhythm keeps us waiting for the climax all the time playing on our nerves and when it comes it doesn't disappoint us. That means that the movie is well balanced in terms of images and suggestions. Are we before a man which is insane beyond any limits and has got almost superhuman powers or are we before a creature which is human only in appearance and is indeed an evil supernatural being in human shape? The movie never explains it fully which adds to its terrifying power. A few flaws here and there are mere details and don't spoil much the logic of the plot. We can ask for instance why the plate number of the car stolen by the murderer isn't communicated to all authorities in which case he would have been quickly caught. But maybe it was and doesn't need to be mentioned in the movie because everything happened so quickly and the murderer went to a small town where that information would perhaps not get quickly enough. Well anyway if the murderer was caught too soon the story could not be told and the movie could not be made. Summing it up we can call this movie goodish after all.
