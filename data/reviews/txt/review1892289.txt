Comparable to the best zombie flicks, but not a zombie flick.

In many ways, it could be seen as an alternative variation on 28 Days Later or even the premier sci-fi zombie thriller Resident Evil. But again, it takes a different angle.

If this gets compared to the Saw films, it's only because they are both gruesome with brutal violence. Both are smart, but this adds a science fiction element to horror.

If it has a clear strength that the Saw films don't have, it's the acting. You don't feel like you're watching TV or B-movie actors. Nor does it rely on one central character as much as 28 or Resident Evil do.
