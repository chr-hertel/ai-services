I like Jessica Alba. Really, I do. But I walked out of this flick after the fourth gratuitous shot of her super-flat tummy writhing under water. I even sat through the underwater wedgies (and believe me, there's enough to please even the most hardened critic).

No idea how the plot unfolded or whether or not they all lived whatever was supposedly chasing them; I couldn't stomach more than twenty minutes of this movie. We know she's hot. We know Paul Walker was carved out of marble in some back-alley Italian studio. Could we please all move on now? The best part of this whole 'film' was my cinnamon soft pretzel, and even then I couldn't enjoy it, knowing that the stars of this movie probably haven't seen such carbs in YEARS.

So my twenty-minute review: nice abs, Jess. Walker, great tan. Writers - uh, HELLO? (I guess that's what their target audience cares about anyway, but they could have at least pretended to be building an actual story.) Anxious to see what others say who were able to sit through the whole thing.
