I have already commented on Richard Lester's "Superman II." While that film is very good on its own, it's not a complete experience without this Donner-directed revamp.

Marlon Brando was removed from the original version so the studio could save some money. He was replaced by Susannah York as Superman's mother in an "artistic" decision that made absolutely no sense and destroyed the whole father-son element of the story, which gets a moment to shine in this cut.

Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) actually has a purpose here beyond "damsel in distress." Once again, she is actually a part of the movie (it's refreshing to see her not screaming). On a related note, the entire Paris terrorist sequence is removed from the movie along with the subplot, making the film a more cohesive whole.

Gene Hackman and Valerie Perrine are, as usual, hilarious together (watch Miss Teschmacher's extended quest to find the bathroom at the Fortress of Solitude), and Christopher Reeve still makes us believe he can fly, in the air and in space. But somehow it wasn't the same without Richard Donner's name in front.

P.S.: Watch the opening credits... it's that amazing laser effect again!
