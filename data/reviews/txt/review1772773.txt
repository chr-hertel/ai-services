You might as well stay home, poop in a bucket, and watch it mold. The special effects in "Tremors" were twice as good as this movie. Classic Stephen King bad acting... I can't believe the dude from Punisher did this movie. I bet he fired his agent after the screening. I was so excited, because "Stand by Me", "The Green Mile" and "Shawshank" are 3 of my fav all time movies... another flop from King! Get it together King! You haven't had a decent movie since Green Mile. Remember its all about "quality" not "quantity"!! Not even worth watching if your friend rented it on DVD. Super disappointed to say the least. I watched half the crowd walk out 20mins into it, as I sat there saying to myself "maybe, just maybe"... boy was I the sucker.
