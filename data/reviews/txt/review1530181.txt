"Bobby" features an all-star cast that play out the lives of ordinary folk intertwined with that fateful time at The Ambassador. I thought that such a familiar set of actors would interfere with the authenticity but it doesn't at all! Their vignettes are all well-portrayed and add to the many moods of the film. These subplots play a perfect backdrop to the main event.The vintage clips are riveting as well as the many now-prophetic words of Bobby Kennedy that pepper the film.

Be prepared to feel many different emotions, almost as if it were 1968 all over again (aided, in part, by a glorious 60s soundtrack). Bobby, like the man it's about, is a winner. If only we had the man instead of the myth today, what a better country and people we would be.
