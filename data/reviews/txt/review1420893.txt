The Descent has one thing working against itself.. A faulty script. It tries to be a lot more than is obvious that the makers of it can handle. There are a number of different approaches brought out but none of them lead anywhere. A watchful eye will sense the effort but the enactment of the movie as a whole really leaves you in the dark. The effects are what you would expect from a 2005 not-so-low-budget movie, the acting is satisfactory to say the least and the ideas for a horror movie aren't all that shabby. Problem is, it all doesn't add up to a whole. The plot is vague starting from a certain cue and then violently turns its back on everything that has just been and starts off as a completely different one. Also, there are a bit too many stupid anti-logic mistakes for a viewer to oversee.

All this adds up to a score of 4/10

The Descent is not a waste of time if you're in to horror movies (the overall quality of them has been rather low since The Ring and 28 Days Later to be honest) but only, if you're in to horror movies.
