"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT," in my opinion, is an absolute FOX classic! I haven't seen every episode, but I still enjoy it. It's hard to say which episode is my favorite. However, I think it's always funny when a mishap occurs. I always laugh at that. It's nice that every main character has stayed with the show throughout its entire run so far. It seems that no one stays with a show throughout its entire run. Everyone always gives a good performance, the setting is spectacular, everything about the characters is well-done, and the writing is always very strong. In conclusion, I hope this show will always live on in syndication once it finishes its run on FOX.
