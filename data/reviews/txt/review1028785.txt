M. Night is losing it, as far as making movies goes. I was really impressed with Sixth Sense, so as with most his fans. His movies are slowing degrading in his story lines. I think he is running out of 'material'.

The behind the scenes, DVD, show all that was involved in making "The Village". I was particularly interested in how much work and training the Joquen Pheonix did to prepare for his role. I think his total amount of dialoge was about 2 minutes for the whole movie.

At the last check, the movie has grossed well under the approximate budget.

I will certainly think twice before I spent any more money on his movies.
