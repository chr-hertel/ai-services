So I had heard of this remake of the 1978 original series, mostly from commercials for it on TV, and had little to no interest in seeing it. I had seen a few of the original episodes and found them to be rather lame and uninteresting. Then one night when I could find nothing on I ended up watching an episode of the new series on Sci Fi and found it to be a bit confusing but enjoyable none-the-less. With my interest piqued I rented the mini-series the next time I was at the video store and I watched the whole 3+ hours that night.

I have to say that this is a really well put together story and while it's obviously not original (being a remake) it is something new and fresh in the world of sci-fi.

I am a fan of the sci-fi/fantasy genre and I have to say this mini-series along with the first two seasons of the show (I've seen em all in the month since I watched the mini) are on the top of my favorites list. This show looks and feels like a theatrical release sci-fi movie.
