I am sorry but this movie was horrible compared to the other two. The director did a horrible job. There were not even any creative and well thought out camera shots or anything like that. X3 was all seriousness, all drama, all emotional, all the time. Barely any action and during the "final battle", the mutants that magneto so aptly named "pawns" ran out to fight they did not even use powers. It was pretty much a bunch of guys running at soldiers with crappy looking weaponry with the cure. No one but the main characters actually used their powers. I could have done the final battle in my backyard. This new director really dropped the bomb and it is really disappointing to see this once awesome franchise turn into a money making scheme, just like so many good vg franchise and movie franchises have done in the past.
