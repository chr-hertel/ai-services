Harper Lee created a classic in her novel. This film adaptation is probably the best novel to film ever. It stars Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch in his Oscar winning role. Mary Badham plays the unforgettable Scout. One of the main reasons that I purchased the film was to see Ruth White in her performance as miserable Mrs. Dubose. Sadly she had a much bigger role in the novel but for everybody involved in this film classic, it was worth any minute of time. Alice Ghostley is also in the film as one of the mother and neighbor. Rosemary Murphy plays Maudie Atkinson. The film is first rate and classic which should never be remade even for today's audiences. It stands on it's own much Godfather and Citizen Kane. Please don't remake this film with today's stars.
