Sometimes actors and directors work with a white hot passion that the screen almost melts in response. That's what "Thérèse Raquin", an extraordinary mini series aired in the US around 1980 or 81, has. The two leads sexual appetites are so openly displayed and animal like that everything that follows seems absolutely correct and plausible. There's such a carnality in their sex that it's breathless. When the plot thickens and murder enters the scene, it's with a sickened heart that you know all are doomed.

This is not for the faint hearted or easily offended. Yep, it's a "Masterpiece Theater" presentation but DO NOT expect the normally stuffy, stiff upper lipped Brit presented. This is more akin to "Body Heat" or "The Postman Always Rings Twice".

See it. You will not forget it.
