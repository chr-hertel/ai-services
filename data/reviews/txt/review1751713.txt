I don't even know where to begin with this movie. There is not one redeeming quality about it, I kept thinking maybe I should just leave. But it was like a train wreck, I couldn't stop watching.

The film was obviously low-budget. Which might have been okay but even an low-budget film needs to reach a critical mass of quality - like being able to understand the actors. Whenever I could understand the actors, I wished that I couldn't as the dialog was unbelievable.

The characters were flat. The only two that were developed were Mason and Darren. The others might as well have been cardboard cut-outs for all the impact that they had. Mason and Darren weren't likable and I didn't sympathize with anything that they went through.

In the end, I wish I had thrown a fit and gotten my money back. I could have had twelve tacos with that money.
