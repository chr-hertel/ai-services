My boyfriend and I went to see this movie after the theater we went to had informed us that the original movie we went to see - Shoot 'Em Up - was down for the day due to problems with the projector.

What a mistake! This movie is, by far, the worst movie I've ever seen. I saw Balls of Fury last week and even though it was SUPPOSED to be a stupid movie, it was NOT AS STUPID AS THIS ONE! There is no coherent plot, there is no coherent story line, there are no coherent actors (I'm pretty sure they had to be on something to be in this flick and think what they were doing was acting), and the CGI was almost worse than the old school use of claymation.

The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it gave my boyfriend and I a lot to laugh about - first off at ourselves for being lame enough to see this movie, second after reading a lot of yahoo user reviews and reviews on here (one man said he'd shoot himself in the knee cap if anyone asked him to see this movie again) we felt highly entertained (though one could just read those reviews and avoid the movie and be fine), and third at how we could not name ONE MOVIE we've ever seen that was worse than this one.

So if you LIKE terrible movies, like REALLY terrible, then this is for you. If you like things that won't give you a headache at how RETARDED they are, don't see this.
