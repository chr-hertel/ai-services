I can not understand why critics and audiences in the theaters did not give this movie the credit it deserved. My history teacher said of this movie "You really have to be a civil war lover to really love this movie", well i am a Civil War lover and i thought this movie was great. Robert Duvall's Robert E. Lee was without a doubt the best ever. Stephan Lang was also great as was Jeff Daniels. The battles of First Manassas, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville was also done with accuracy and brilliant detail. For the people that hate movies today because they are not accurate, they sure were hypocritical of this movie, because the stereotypes of the Confederates as "savage rebels" was replaced with the South as southern gentleman, Was slavery wrong, Yes absolutely, the highest crime against humanity is to enslave an entire people, but Gods and Generals was a movie about Stonewall Jackson in his most famous battles and if you are not a Civil War enthusiast, then of course you wont like it. I loved this movie, I loved Bob Dylan's singing at the ending credits, I loved the accuracy of the movie. I am just sorry that more people didn't.
