This was one of the best of the entire run, which for this show means it was funnier than maybe four or five episodes. Even for a show this uniformly excellent, "The Killer Shrews" was merciless above and beyond with a rapid-fire silliness that becomes surreal.

The movie itself is silly enough to be entertaining on its own. Unleash Joel and the Bots on it and the experience is sublime. This is one of the few times I would recommend seeing the film without the commentary first. It helps you appreciate more what the boys bring to the table. I wish I could quote specific jokes from the presentation. Out of context they would come off flat. Okay, just one. Synchronized drinking. If you've seen this, you know what I mean.
