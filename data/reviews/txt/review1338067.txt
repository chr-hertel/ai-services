This one is from the finest movies i've ever seen because gentlemen r history now. Their love was so strong i wanna have 1 like it in the future. I've also read the novel and it's so good. I mean Jane Austen in this novel is a genius. Can any 1 tell me if there still any gentlemen left on earth (I DON'T THINK SO) because they're gone with the wind. I never met a gentlemen in my whole life.

Pride and Prejudice is a movie u must see. U can't but 2 love it. What i love the most is when Mr. Bingley made a ball and Darcy was so cold and then he changed 180 degree. I also love when he told her how could he make amends after all what he had done to her but it's still isn't enough for him.
