Eager to tell a story certain aspects of the plot and characters can take a back seat to a film's desire to push the plot.

The film was successful, however, I feel like proper pacing and better character development would have helped.

The political rhetoric, name and fact dropping get old after a while mostly because their analysis is only surface deep. A desire for more thought provoking facts could have helped validate the hero's desire.

Overall acting felt tense and awkward which made the craft more noticeable and made it difficult to let go of the actor's fame.

It's a unique film in it's story and arguably would have been better in a more independent circuit or with less known actors. An overall style or unique artifact was desired and severely missed.
