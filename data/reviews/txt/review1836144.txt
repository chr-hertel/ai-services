The photography was fantastic (who doesn't love drooling over islands and crystal clear blue water?!) and Kate and Matthew made a cute, charismatic couple. The plot was a bit contrived and predictable, but we knew going into it it wasn't going to be super cerebral! But, the addition of Alexis Dziema as Gemma, Donald Sutherland's daughter, was HORRIBLE!! A little bit of her would have sufficed; a lot of her was simply irritating beyond belief! I thought she was a 13 yr old child, with her squeaky, annoying voice! Her character got far too much attention, making me wonder WHY?? since it seemed awkward and forced! And, then, the writers/directors/producers decide to add in the lovely part about the sword landing between bikini-clad, spread-eagled legs that I felt was rude, crude, and something only 12 yr old boys would find humorous and entertaining!! When 'Gemma' entered the scene, the movie was ruined for me!
