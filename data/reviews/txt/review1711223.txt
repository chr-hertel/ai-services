I appreciated this movie very much. I enjoyed how they showed how much everyone had changed from the season. First they showed what they looked like in the series then what they looked like after the series. I was pleasantly surprised to see how much John Walton had changed since the series. He had such white hair and I think takes after his father Zeb Walton. I didn't know he made a mistake when he said "oh Pa. It's been 15 years and I miss you like it was yesterday." Then he says " I remember you once told me there's no pain like the one your kids can give you." I really took that to heart. I have to say I put my self in his place and could see where he was coming from. The mother look like she was getting tired of doing her role as Olivia Walton. Anyways, I really do hope they do a reunion movie again real soon. Thank you.
