When I saw the trailers on TV I started to jump and sing. After seeing the shows with interviews I got anxious to see the movie. 

Now that I've seen it... I can't stop singing the musics and remembering the scenes. 

A word to Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Julie Walters and Colin Firth they were tremendously good in the movie.

They are no professional singers but they really surprised me. Specially Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan. 

So I just can say, and using a word from another great movie, Mamma Mia just is: Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

I've seen it twice already, and going for a third view or more.
