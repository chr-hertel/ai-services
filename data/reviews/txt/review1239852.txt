"If Only" is simply one of these movies you just can't stop watching. any of us can relate to these characters. after all, they're only two people struggling to love each other, no matter what tomorrow may bring. it makes you wonder whether you're just too busy to remember _ or even to notice _ those simple little things that made you fall in love in the first place. and what better way to re-discover what your love is all about than to get a second chance? the question is, if there are no second chances, what shall we do? well, after watching "If Only", the thought of being aware of the shortness of our time makes us want to live it to the fullest... what if tomorrow never comes? what would be left unsaid?...
