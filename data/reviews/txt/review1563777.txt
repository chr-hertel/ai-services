I love Roald Dahl and this is a good adaptation. Danny Devito directed it well and kept the feeling throughout. He was also brilliant as the crass, crooked father. Matilda is a little girl with extraordinary gifts, but neglected and derided by her family. She reads and reads and wants to go to school and finally as a punishment her dad sends her. She has the sweetest teacher, and a violent, hateful principal. One of Roald Dahl's tricks is to make everyone into caricatures to enforce the meaning. The parents and principal are constantly telling the kids "I'm big, you're little. I'm right, you're wrong." He makes the kids the hero in a battle with adults and empowers the children in a cartoonish setting. Matilda learns that she has the powers of telekinesis and uses them to teach Ms. Trunchbull a lesson and vindicate Miss Honey. A enjoyable ride for children and adults alike.

This movie is like Tang, the drink of the astronauts. It is sweet (sometimes too much so), and fortified with vitamins. Mix those neon crystals with water, stir and enjoy. Kids love it, can't get enough of it in fact, and adults secretly love it as well, unless they've become big and right and full of themselves. 7/10
