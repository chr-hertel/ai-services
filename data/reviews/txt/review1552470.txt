I am now leery what Zhang will do to the Beijing Olympic's show. He is getting worse in the art of telling stories with film material. Curse of the Golden Flower is a joke. There is no believable emotions in any of the actors, and the action is fake. The color is ridiculous and the story is illogical. I hope this movie will not represent China because this does not even match up to Kung Fu Hustle of 2005. Zhang should return to make movies of small budget, like Not One Less, Road Home etc. Even Hero is not as good as his first historical drama:The Great Conqueror's Concubine.At least, Zhang is not pretending he is making another martial arts movie. In the epic fighting scene of Lords of the Ring ,part 1, it is believable. But Zhang rather copies from Matrix, part III, his special CG doesn't know how to generate random motion, and therefore everything is happening predictable and fake.He also copies from The Fall Of The Roman Empire in creating the last battle.The only good acting is the Liu, who plays Prince Wen.
