The story in the games is far better than this story. The film flat-out isn't scary. It's not creepy. It just walks you from locale to locale and trots out monsters from the games, but doesn't at all deliver on the feel. And the entire ending is just terrible. Where was all the subtlety and downright horror of the games? It's been replaced with just gore and unnecessary CGI, such as the unnecessary bugs. Plus, apart from Cybil shooting one monster, no one fights back in the entire movie. Especially disappointing was Brookhaven Hospital, which could and should have been terrifying but turned out to be just another place. If they do make a sequel, let's hope someone else writes and directs it.
