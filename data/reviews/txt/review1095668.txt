Joseph Gordon-Levitt performance was awesome! He is truly a great actor. The story just kept me entertained through out. I highly recommend this movie to all. I enjoyed this movie like none I have in a long time. I am a very hard person to please and when I enjoy a movie it is usually a good one. If you like the work of Joseph Gordon-Levitt in other movies and his work on 3rd Rock from the Sun you will love it in this movie. Don't hesitate to see the movie and when you have seen the movie order the book from Amazon.com and read it as well. A AAA++++ movie and like the Ebert and Roper I give it two thumbs up as well. Well done Joseph Gordon-Levitt you are truly a star and one that I feel will be a super star soon.
