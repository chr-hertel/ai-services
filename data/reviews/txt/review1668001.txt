At about 1954 or so, MGM decided to cut costs so they began using cheaply drawn backgrounds as well as simpler animation in their cartoons. While the cartoons were still decent, they were noticeably worse that the great MGM cartoons of the mid to late 1940s. Despite this, PET PEEVE is still a very good cartoon, as it is everything a person usually wants in a Tom and Jerry cartoon--violent.

Spike, Tom and Jerry all live in the same home. The home owners are pretty awful people because they decide that the best way to deal with mounting bills is to get rid or Spike or Tom...but which one? Well, this problem is taken firmly in hand by Spike and Tom who spend most of the film beating the crap out of each other to win their owners' love! Funny and action-packed--this one's a keeper.
