This movie is a must sea. this movie is hilarious from start finish i could watch it over and over again, and still could not get bored over it. Not only is this film funny but it is also a true romance like the 'Girl Next Door' but much funnier and entertaining. When i walked into the cinema to see it i was expecting a lot from it because it said it was done by the makers of American pie which was also a great film. The film was not too long to bore you like a lot of recent films have been like, but isn't too short too to leave you walking out disappointed, personally i think the timing/length of the film was perfect. I highly recommend this film if you want to see a true comedy or have laugh. i think its the best film out at the cinema today.
