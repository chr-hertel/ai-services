This movie is self indulgent in a way I would expect a self funded film to be. For example, assuming the audience is going to sit through a painfully slow opening in order to 'see what happens' is a mistake of many first time directors. Lazing on 'beautiful' camera angles, longing 'deep' looks by the actors, and a score that rambles, the film never really gets going and worst of all, doesn't wrap up - leaving many open ended questions and a feeling one has just wasted the afternoon.

Adding insult to injury is the endless prattle by the director about non-substantive silliness in her director's commentary track. It doesn't matter that the acting was 'amazing' or that the look was deep, where's the story? What's the point? The director forgot her audience or assumed they cared about her, and went on some trek to find herself! And while in places there are admirable qualities to the film making, overall isn't the idea to make money and boost the careers for everyone involved by making a good, sale-able product? 

I never heard of this film when it came out. If I had invested in it I would be more than a little annoyed. I can only assume her studios (there were three) have money to burn for (very) expensive therapy. 

She must have a fantastic agent.
