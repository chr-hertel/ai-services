Quite simply, it's some REALLY funny stuff...

I don't really think Season Two slacked off at the start...and I didn't notice the cleaned up language...

It's REALLY funny...And it's in short "Skits" too...

It's got some pretty good satire, and some REALLY funny crazy stuff, and it can be watched for...well...2 hours in one sitting...then for a LONG time...

Heck, my DAD likes it! (And he's over 50...) I haven't shown it to my mom, but she doesn't like cussing...

I recommend this to everyone...
