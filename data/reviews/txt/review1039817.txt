I watched this mini series when it was first aired on UK TV and I'm amazed it's never been released either on video or latterly on DVD. Robert Vaughn is superb in his role as a sinister 'background' character to the downward spiralling president.

Jason Robards, in one of his better acted roles, is also very believable as the president who is initially tarnished, then eventually dethroned by corruption.

I think the time has come for another generation to enjoy this excellent production - I can't imagine why it's never even been aired again by any of the major TV companies.

So therefore - please somebody - get it out on DVD!!!
