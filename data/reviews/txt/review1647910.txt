I think Robert Ryan is one of the greatest actors of his time and its a shame that he seems to be forgotten in todays movie society, This is am excellent example of Ryans acting prowess and shows how the will to live is so strong despite being betrayed and abandoned in a place with out hope. I would say this is a must see for people interested in Robert Ryans acting and his excellent ability to make it all seem so real. I like the fact that he never gives up despite all the odds thrown against him when adultery alone makes most people lose the will to carry on. I have seen this movie twice now and have been riveted to the TV both times. Years ago having seen Robert Ryan in a few movies I thought he was OK but this movie proves he was much more than that and I look forward to discovering him in his other movies I have yet to see.
