Dunmore's costume drama/demented medieval film which is kind of reminiscent of a more impressive Quills from 2000 starring Geoffrey Rush, is a decent effort, but although Depp's performance was first-rate as always, this film didn't impress me much. It achieved one thing which was being a gross picture which created an account of a unlikeable person like the Earl Of Rochester, and most of this was due to Depps performance. Stephen Jeffreys screenplay from his play is solid although all the ideas don't work in this picture and at times it is boring and slow. The performances are good as JOhn Malkovich and Samantha Morton were very good in their roles in the film. IMDb rating: 6.8, my rating: 7/10
