What a brilliant comedy duo they were; these two were to Hollywood what Morcambe and Wise were to British TV. Always one of my film favourites, Wilder was at his comedy best when twinned with Pryor, and vice versa; they just seem to bounce off each other and this film is the perfect medium for them to do that. It is one of their best, one of THE best. My favourite moment..?

Wilder to Pryor: I would tell you how I feel about you, but at the moment I'm overwhelmed by the stink of the 7,000 tonnes of garbage you just drove us into!!! Pryor to Wilder: Is that what it is??? I thought you let one go, that's why I didn't say anything! Wilder to Pryor: That was KIND of you...
