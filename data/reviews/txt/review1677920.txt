Although made three years earlier than John Wayne's inane Jet Pilot (1957), this film is superior in plot (it is a Michener after all), aerial combat staging, photography, acting and in everything else. Carrier operations are shown in much detail making those familiar with them realize that little has changed in running those floating military airports. The catapult launching, the recovery using tailhooks and nets, use of the "tilly," a kind of gantry on wheels to move disabled planes --- all these remain essentially the same. The flagman signaling to the incoming pilot as to his position in relation to the deck, however, is today a rare sight. With the development of avionics, the pilot nowadays is electronically hooked on to the carrier's sensors telling him how the deck is inclined (it's a ship pitching on the waves, remember) so he could approach it at the correct angle for a safe landing.

Although made with the US navy's and presumably the Department of Defense's cooperation, the film does try to balance between the jingoistic rant of "cold warriors" prevalent at that time and the peace lovers. The intervention in Korea is justified by the Admiral (portrayed by Frederic March) so that they wouldn't have to fight the enemy on American soil. Commander Brubaker (William Holden), however, feels that he is "in the wrong war, in the wrong place." 

The bombing run scenes are magnificent in their scope and the superb flying of the pilots in the smart looking Panthers are memorable.

Compare with The Hunters, another film about the Korean war starring Robert Mitchum and Bob Wagner as Air Force pilots.
