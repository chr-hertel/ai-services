Recently was given season one of Monk to watch on DVD while I was on holiday and loved every minute of it. Watched the complete season in one day, found I was unable to stop watching it! Then had to search the net for more. Thankfully I was able to find seasons one & two on an auction site. Have since managed to find seasons three and four. Loved seasons two - four just as much as season one. I have to admit I was a bit worried when I saw that Monk's first assistant Sharona was being replaced half way through season three, but found that by the end of the episode that Natalie was introduced I really like her character. She seems to be a bit more patient and understanding with Monk than Sharona was. Some times Sharona seemed to get rather short with him. Have just ordered season five from the States as it has not come out here in New Zealand yet and don't think it will be long before I do the same with season six. My thanks to everyone who helps to provide such entertaining viewing. Long may it continue!!!!
