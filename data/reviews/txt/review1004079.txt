A brief opening scene of his childhood offers a somewhat implausible explanation of why the brilliant Howard Hughes became the broken wreck he is likely to be better known as by todays generation.

DeCaprio does a first class job of portraying Hughes both as the aggressive tycoon and as the pathetic recluse he eventually became.This film is a cameo of the years when Hughes was at his peak and for me at least made me want to know much more about this complex man.

Kate Blanchett's performance as Kathleen Hepburn is one of her best recently, and although there have been some adverse comments about the length of the film I have to agree with one patron who said to me as I was leaving:- "I could have watched it all night".
