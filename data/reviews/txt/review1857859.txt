Lena Headey, Thomas Dekker and Summer Glau is like trinity reflecting the modern family, mother, child and the so called "holy spirit". You know there is too much violence here towards good people just like bad attitudes towards the good actors but i also want to say some things i like about these series, good play of Lena Headey and Thomas Dekker reflecting the misunderstanding between parents and teens, two different generations and one more thing i just cant help sharing personally i think Lena Headey and Summer Glau are really very sexy and beautiful women, one of them is clever and the other one is very strong :) good wishes!
