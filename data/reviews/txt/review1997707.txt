This documentary complete blew me away with it's coverage on it's subjects. At first, I thought this was going to be about how Gustavo Dudamel rose to conduct the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra at the Beethovenfest, but this documentary focuses on the kids. The way the kids were filmed, the stories they told, and their journeys are unforgettable.

This is a film EVERY musician should see due to the amount of dedication these children put in to become as great as they are. Your jaw will drop when you see the rehearsals. I could never imagined such a quantity of musicians in one room, let alone believe it. I may sound like I'm over impressed, but I can't think of anything the describes how amazed I am on what I saw. Do yourself a favor and buy it.
