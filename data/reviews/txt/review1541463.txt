Words fail me. I do not possess the proper powers of verbiage to fully communicate just how terrible this tripe is. If there are any saving attributes, they are masked by the thoroughly inane entirety of this mess.

There is little, if anything, that has the humor of the original cartoon. The casting of Fred and Barney is, at best, awful. I suppose the actors portraying Betty and Wilma are somewhat grace-saving and Dino, well, what can you say about Dino that hasn't been said before.

Thankfully, Pebbles and Bam-Bam were not yet around to have to endure this.
