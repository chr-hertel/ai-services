Spielberg is undeniably a great director but this film is so awful that almost any film by any director would look good in comparison. The plot crosses the line from good yarn into fantasy, the mistakes they make whilst revealing their lack of knowledge about South Asia would horrify anyone less geographically challenged, & the naive way they make a Shanghai street urchin (whose language would make him more at home in Hong Kong) so devoted to American culture. barely acceptable in a kids picture but in a film whose rating makes it unviewable to most kids, no. The fact that Kate Capshaw had to beat over 100 other actresses to get this role makes me dread to think what the others were like! (I still remember her fake-fluent Japanese in 'Black Rain'!) However, even the best of directors have their weaknesses; Clint Eastwood had Sandra Locke & this film 'introdcuced us to the future Mrs Spielberg. I read that she had to learn how to scream for this film, but as she does very little else, what did she do for her screen test -- or maybe I don't want to know! If it's this or a film about paint drying, toss a coin!
