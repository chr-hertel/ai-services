I wasn't blown away by this last film by Lucas. I seen it a while back, and now I am finally getting around to post my thoughts about it. I was listening to all the hype like "Oh, it explains everything, and that everything will come full circle and you'll understand it all." Well, yeah it summed up everything. But, I personally think that Lucas is far more imaginative than having Vader burned up in a lava flow. It could have been better. Lucas is a genius, and I expected SO much more. So much more of the love between anakin and padme, more examples of what lured anakin to the dark side, and more problematic incidences tearing him and padme apart. Anyway, I'm bummed, I don't hate it, but I don't like it either. :0| Neutral :0|
