What happens when a positive story with humor and an optimistic message is retold as a depressing melodrama riddled with pessimism, disease and negativity? A masterpiece? No, of course not. The result is something so absurdly different from the original that there's simply no reason to acknowledge any connection between the two. Just think of Seisohen as something else. A different story with different characters.

We know that Kenshin wants to redeem himself for the blood he spilled during the revolution, but who knows why, in Seisohen he decides to go to China to kill even more people. The impression is given that Kenshin's lust for blood is so strong that he goes sneaking out at night killing people... because he can't escape his cruel destiny of a killer. The whole story behind the Reverse blade sword is lost. The motive of redemption through helping people is lost. 

If you've seen the original series, watching Seisohen will probably give you the feeling that all the main characters are on drugs, terminally ill or suicidal. You might ask: "What the hell happened to everyone?" or "Is the Ghost of Christmas future showing me this?" No, you're simply watching a different show. Something as absurd as a melodrama based on "South Park" or a comedy based on "Schindler's list". Just imagine.

The ending of Rurouni Kenshin is Episode 95: "End of Wanderings". That's it. Only watch Seisohen if you haven't seen the original, otherwise you'll be sorry.

An objective 2 stars out of 10 because the plagiarism and melodramatism negate anything achieved by the animation.
