During the early 1930's in America "Frankenstein" 1931 and "Dracula" were big hits for screen goers and the European Film Makers decided to make their first film a Dracula film without Bela Lugosi.

The director of this picture did not pick famous actors for his characters, he chose ordinary people he knew or met without any acting abilities. In this picture there were only two professional actors hired to play certain key roles. This film has a very dark and deeply spiritual tale with antiques furnished in a very old French castle that was in ruined conditions and neglected, which made a perfect location. This is a very creepy slow moving film, but excellent for the year 1932.
