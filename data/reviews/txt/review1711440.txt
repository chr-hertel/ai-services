If you're going to be crude, and-or outrageous, you better be funny.

I know the guy's dead but I'm sorry: I don't what the attraction ever was for actor Chris Farley. He and the movies he was in, generally speaking, were trash, I mean absolute garbage. He was a huge, slobby guy and not funny. You can be a big slob and still be a real likable actor, like John Candy. But, this guy was no John Candy. David Spade, his comedic partner in this film, isn't exactly the Bob Hope of comedians for this age, either.

This is a typically crude PG-13 comedy of today that does have it's funny moments but overall is low class. In this film, believe me, most of the skits were not funny and they are the usual sex jokes. Hollywood is obsessed with sex in its comedy movies. Hey, I can laugh at dumb humor with the best of 'em, and I'll laugh at good sex joke, too, but I couldn't find that many good sketches in here. That's the film really is, one sketch after another featuring Farley and/or Spade. This guys did better in "Tommy Boy," but not much better. 

It's these kind of films that give today's comedy films a bad name.
