I know nothing about German WWII ships, Allied sub missions, and the recovery of Nazi encoding thing-a-magiggers. Call me naive, call me stupid, just don't call me ignorant when it comes to knowing a good action film when I see it. Forget about history, if I wanted a historical documentary, I would have watched one. This movie is about action, explosions, and submarine warfare. And I got plenty of it. I'm bothered at how many reviews bash this film for it's historical inaccuracy. I really didn't care. If your looking for action, adventure, and GREAT surround sound, watch this film. There are LOTS of films that don't depict history accurately, that are great films. You don't see five hundred bad reviews for Braveheart because thats not historically accurate. I have yet to read a review about Saving Private Ryan that argues the fact that there was no Private Ryan to actually save. And I'm pretty sure nobody ever complained that The Perfect Storm couldn't possibly be accurate, considering the entire crew died. This movie is good, no matter how you look at it. Enjoy it for what it's worth, and then go to you local library and learn all about U boats. Watch this movie with the volume LOUD, turn your sub UP, and watch the windows rattle at the depth charges. This movie will blow you out of your seat!
