I love, love, love, love this movie! I have probably watched it beginning to end 25 times and never tire of it. Probably the only other comedy I have seen as many times is Blazing Saddles.

Dreyfuss, Garr and Johansen and especially Tilly are great. I couldn't think of anyone else playing these parts.

This is the type of movie that gets lost on the shelves of your local video store. The actors are solid, but not stars, and the movie is not geared to the "moron" crowd. But it constantly delivers belly laugh after belly laugh.

And to think it's just a little story about a guy at the track that is "having a very good day"!
