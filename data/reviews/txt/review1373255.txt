Poseidon is a MUST SEE movie for everyone of all ages. Two hours after seeing the movie I still felt like I had just left the ship. It was a crazy wild ride with anticipation around every corner. This movie far exceeded my expectations. I was hoping that it would keep true to the original. It paralleled the original in a unique way but also had so many differences that every corner had an unexpected twist. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. I want to see it again right now! I would recommend this movie to everyone-especially those who remember and love the original. I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in years. A+++ My faith is restored in Hollywood!!!! Kudo's Warner Brother's! Great Job! :)
