Very good...at least as good as I expected, if not better.

There was one small continuity error that should have been caught but wasn't.

You'll see it easily enough...

This film does a good job at showing the violent things and at the same time letting your imagination do its thing.

The acting was pretty good -- I mean, I have never been jigsawed or know anyone who has, so I do not know exactly how one would act in those situations.

I am glad, however, that your average serial killer is not that clever.
