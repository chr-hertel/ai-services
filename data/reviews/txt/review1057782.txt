i was unsure of how this would work, i had read the books and wasn't sure if it would translate. i was surprised with how faithful it was, and i couldn't be happier. i particularly love the first story, mickey Rourke is very good as Marv. all of the complaining i've heard of the violence and degradation of women are way off. as far as violence, i've seen far worse. and i believe the women in the stories have the power over men. Rodriguez does all three of these stories justice, they're all dark and very intense. i do wish the stories would have come together a little better in the end, but i am satisfied with the payoff. best movies so far this year, but episode 3 and batman are right over the horizon.
