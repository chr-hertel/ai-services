Summary: Probably the most enjoyable film of the summer season (OK, OK, it's fall now, but bear with me). Action packed without being gratuitous, characters with flaws and shades that aren't trowelled on, a plot that take you to unexpected places, good acting, great dialogue (Mr Lucas, can you hear me?) and a breathless finale that really makes for a worthy pay-off.

It's a high rating, I know, but it's the first film I've seen this year that made me really care about what was happening. The characters were much better rounded than I'd expected, given the large lead cast not everybody was going to get enough screen-time to be fleshed out completely, but what there was was good, with the centre-stage cast doing a great job, Fillon and Glau being outstanding.

However, the film isn't flawless, sometimes due to the relatively small budget (some of the cg is >slightly< plastic), sometimes due to some strange editing and camera use that feels more at home on the small screen - especially in the first half. Then there is the plot, which rattles so fast that there's no opportunity to take a bathroom break or loose attention. Sometimes it a case of blink and you miss it.

The biggest weakness, however, is also the film's greatest strength. It doesn't FEEL like a Hollywood job. Characters face the consequences of their actions nd choices to be where they are, and the price is sometimes very high indeed.

Finally, did anybody else spot the new Battlestar Galactica in one shot?
