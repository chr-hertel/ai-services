OMG...This movie had it all. The Effects. The Plot. The Action. The predictable cameo from Stan Lee (look for it).Note to self:cameos are cool and I should be in all of my films.What else can I say about a film that has raked in 200 Million over the last 5 days (according to the radio station that I showered to this morning) and thats darn impressive! I remember getting a text message saying stay till after the credits and I am happy I did and for those who are probably reading this-you know why. Robert Downey Jr.-No relation to Morton Downey Jr. has really delivered as opposed to Mr. Pacino (in 88 Minutes). His Stark is believable-Jeff Bridge's character is also believable.
