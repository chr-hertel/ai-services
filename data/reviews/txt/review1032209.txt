Minor British pictures quite often turn out to be little gems and here's another contribution to that fine tradition.

Simon Pegg turns in an assured performance as the hapless Shaun, a loser in a dead-end job who knows how to hang on to useless friends, like Ed (nauseatingly well played by Nick Frost), but can't keep his attractive girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) because he can't manage a simple thing like reserving a restaurant table. Then he really finds himself as London is subjected to a plague of zombies.

Difficult to fault any of the performances in this film and the soundtrack is well judged, but the main pleasures are in the visual gags and some superb one liners. My favorite among the former were the early scenes showing the deadening nature of Shaun's everyday life and a later scene where Shaun's party, seeking to find refuge at a local pub, encounter a party led by his ex-girlfriend. The groups are mirror images and greet each other as if they were at a vicarage tea party!

The ending works well, though some may find it tasteless. It is at least consistent with the rest.

Recommended, unless you're put off by gore or strong language. Rating: 7/10.
