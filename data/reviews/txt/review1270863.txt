The movie is done very well, and the animation makes the characters more believable, the songs are great to dance and sing to.

This movie is great for all ages, because it shows that the old saying is true, that Love conquers all! Mini-Spoiler: For example when most of the Pound Puppies (except for Cooler and the Purries) are turned mean coursty of Mcnasty's Mean Machine, it takes one Colette's puplings to say to her that they love her just as she growling and about to hurt them to change her back, so Cooler notices this, say's it to her friend Reflex and then by the ringing of a bell, has Reflex saying to all the Pound Puppies by hugging and kissing them.

So if you want a good family film without the volenice to enjoy. Get this one.
