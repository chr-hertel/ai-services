COAST TO COAST is an obscure big studio film few have seen or even heard of. It stars two actors who are short, jittery and have lotsa hair. In other words, it stars two Ewoks. OK, enough with the silliness. COAST TO COAST stars Robert Conrad and Dyan Cannon, who do look like Ewoks. Dyan does her usual nervous Blond ditz who talks a mile a minute, while Robert plays it light (for once) but is rarely convincing playing cute. Usually built like a Pit Bull, Conrad here looks chubby. His ultra tight jeans don't help dispel the weight gain.

The story is about a trucker who...stop it there. A trucker? Oh it's one of those road movies made during the CB trend of the 1970s. It's a trend that truly belongs in the 70s and will most likely never resurface again until the end of time. The film itself is harmless enough so there's no point of really trashing it but needless to say, it's not really good. The story is obvious, never convincing and the two stars are not interesting enough to carry an entire film, as lightweight as it is. The film is not on DVD yet. I watched on video. I doubt it'll ever make it on DVD in the near future.
