I guess not everyone will like this movie as it contains some disturbing scenes and some might not appreciate its almost free-form storytelling. However, I feel that the sheer lack of explanation and the way it lets you understand it in your own way - or the way you succeed in preparing yourself to understand it - clears our usual presumptuous minds and makes room for greater self awareness, finally leading to extremely powerful catharsis. I won't go into details of the story. If you're still interested in finding your darkest self and come out laughing, are not afraid to not understand everything and don't mind occasional subtitles then you should see this movie. Hint: Stay in your seat for the credits, you won't regret it!
