The first time I heard about this movie was, as I found a trailer on the Shrek DVD. Unless that these Shrek DVD was for Europe, the trailer showed the time of first release (in USA!). So I waited, and waited, and waited - and then they announced Madagascar for Europe. I could see this movie, some weeks later I could buy the DVD, because you can enjoy the movie more than one time. It's funny. The style is a bit unusual, when I compare with Shrek, Jimmy Neutron, Monsters inc. etc. but it works and gives to the movie a special charm. I guess, the makers of "Madagascar" are a little inspired by the french cartoon series "Wild instinct", because some similarities. It's a movie I can recommend at all, it can impress in cinema and on DVD (and this is not always granted, some movies disappoint outside cinemas).
