The story is set to take place as Bond reaches his 00-status. This would logically be the early 60s since the first Bond movie to place in the early 60s. At the same time the story takes place in modern time, cellphones, the cold war has been over for some time and other modern electronical gadgets is used in the film.

Trying to make a at least somewhat believable story in these circumstances is awful. It's like making a film about world war II, only it takes place now, in modern time. Also M is played by Judi Dench who have played M in a few Bond movies back, but, if you recall the original M was a man and not a woman.

I wonder if the producers of this film have the brain of a two year old?
