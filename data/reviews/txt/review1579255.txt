Wow...Probably the most overrated movie in the entire IMDb!!

This is by far the stupidest movie of the 21st century!!

I couldn't care less about each and every single member of the highly unlikely psychotic family, especially the mom for her intelligence.

Just Trust me. Try to watch the movie again and focus on what she does throughout the movie. She's just everywhere without doing anything and contributing nothing.

I bet she himself doesn't know what she's talking about at times. The whole movie was such a mess and I don't know how this movie got such a high rating in IMDb. 

Don't even watch it on DVD. It's a complete waste of time.

AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!
