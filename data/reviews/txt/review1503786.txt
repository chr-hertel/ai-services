I used to be a Rowan Atkinson unconditional fan until I saw the unexpectedly mediocre Bean film (which actually had its funny moments, no matter how poor the script was). The disappointment was already tremendous at that time, but I did not want to admit then that Atkinson's career was on the wrong track. This "Johnny English" made definitely obvious that my worst fears had become true: Atkinson's ability to make me laugh has vanished. I don't know if I must blame the actor, but one can only say how unconvincing he is now in his usual "so-stupid-would-be-spy-that-no-matter-what he-does-ends-up-as-a-catastrophe" act. Every single gag is foreseen 3 minutes before it happens. The embarrassment was huge when I watched this lame parody. John Malkovich doesn't help either. His unbearable overacting made me sick. Sorry if I am too honest about it. But I sincerely disliked this film. Bought it second-handed at low price and deeply regret my money.
