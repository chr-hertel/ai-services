Notice what I said in my summary, THE perfect film. Not A perfect film, THE perfect film. How can you get any better than The Master, Alfred Hitchcock, and arguably two of the greatest actors of all time, Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman? The result is a chemistry that cannot be resisted by anyone, even the most hardest of critics. 

Bergman, and her gripping performance as a sad, confused, and war-torn soul looking for love is simply stunning. I have to admit, as great of a star as Ms. Bergman is, before Notorious, I had never seen her in a film before. I was blown away by Notorious. If Ms. Bergman's performance in this film does not suck you into this film, maybe Cary Grant's will. What can I say? Mr. Grant is, in my opinion, one of the greatest actors of film's history. His work in Hitchcock's Notorious is no exception. As great as Ms. Bergman and Mr. Grant are, we cannot forget, shall we say, the real star of this perfect film? Alfred Hitchock. Mr. Hitchcock and his camera are superb. The way he uses the lens to capture images that tell the story is an inspiration to every director as the way to use the visual medium of film. But his amazing direction does not stop with the camera. You can see his masterful work in every aspect of the film, through his actors, through the story, through the writing and dialog, and through his trademark suspense. 

What more can I say? If the combination of Bergman, Grant, and Hitchcock doesn't stir you enough to want to go and rent this movie as fast as you possibly can, then I don't know what to say! See it and be transfixed, thrilled, and amazed by the perfect film.
