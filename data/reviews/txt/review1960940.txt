Football Under Cover is about the trip by a German women football team from Berlin to Iran to play the Iranian women national team; the first ever visit by a foreign ladies team to Iran. The "under cover" in the title refers to the requirement of women, including football players, to wear a head scarf in Iran. This also applied to the German ladies. This highly entertaining film covers the event from inception of the idea to the match itself. It's full of both poignant and hilarious moments. The most poignant moments concern one of the Iranian women players who, just before the all important game, is omitted from the Iranian team. The reasons for this are never explained, either by the Iranian authorities or the movie.

The film's main focus is on the difficulties and restrictions experienced by women in Iran. They are not admitted to stadiums to watch soccer matches, unless it's a ladies game for which no men spectators are allowed. The women spectators make loud protests during the game but what comes through clearly is the passion of the Iranian women for football and the power of this game to unite people from different cultures. According to the film's director this movie has not been given clearance to be shown in Iran. However its pirate DVD's are bound to surface there soon. Catch it if you can!
