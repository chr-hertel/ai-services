Michael Clayton is to G Clooney what K pak was to K Spacey, an exercise on self indulgency. But the viewer is at falut here. We know that actors producing, starring and influencing their own movies are bound to demand being in every scene, long deep unnecessary close ups, long speeches, and whatever it takes them to get an Oscar nomination. All that was missing was clooney having sex or half naked...or maybe he was, but i was too busy yawning and clearing my eyes as to not fall asleep and make sure i got my $15 worth. This is a pointless movie about evil business written by people who don't understand businesses acted by people who have never hold a position of management in their lifes. Please don't waste your time.
