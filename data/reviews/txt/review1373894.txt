Having read and thoroughly enjoyed the book i went to see the movie expecting the worst, a big budget, soulless cash in. This, sadly is partly true.

The movie begins slowly and for someone who has read the book it was obviously predictable, it followed the book religiously (no pun intended), but for people who haven't read the book its well worth a watch. However, this is where the good points end.

Audrey Tautou seems bored throughout and Tom Hanks appears to be going through the motions and nothing else. Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing is impressive but is let down somewhat by the rest of the cast.

The brief moments of action in the movie seem rushed and haphazard, almost cheap. The whole film seems rushed and the story moves at an incredible pace, yet somehow, it seems overlong. 

Overall, anyone that hasn't read the book will be carried along blissfully by the story but for the rest of us it will be a disappointment and nothing more.
