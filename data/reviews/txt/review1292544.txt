The Shipping News may be Lasse Hallstr√∂m's most underrated movie. It isn't "The Cider House Rules" but it is an enjoyable movie that is worth watching.

He couldn't have asked for a better cast of actors for the roles of Quoyle, Agnes, Wavey and Petal. Kevin Spacey becomes Quoyle in yet another spectacular performance. Judi Dench is the only person who could have pulled off Agnes so well. Julianne Moore does a brilliant job as Wavey even capturing the Newfoundland accent so that it seems she has spoke that way all her life. Cate Blanchett makes a small role memorable as it has to be in this movie because of Quoyle's relationship to Petal. And other than some bad accents you can't fault the supporting cast either.

The cinematography in this movie is spectacular and the choice to actually go up to Newfoundland proves to be right one with some amazing sights shown on the screen for the first time.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and will happily watch it again and again.

8/10
