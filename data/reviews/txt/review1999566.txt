It appears as though the makers of this movie were striving for something akin to Clerks. Unfortunately the writers had nothing clever, interesting, or even colorfully profane to entertain the audience with.

Ultimately, this movie misses the mark of entertaining with bland dialog being forced out by bad actors.

The only remotely interesting part is how much the person playing the character of Alex is reminiscent of Ben Affleck in his early films. 

If you're a timid would-be filmmaker this movie is kind of inspiring from a perspective that even if your movie sucks it might end up in the DVD section of BestBuy one day. Other than that, stay away.
