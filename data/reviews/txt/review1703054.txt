This movie is extremely gripping, I found myself lost in it and it made me very emotional. The relationship between bother and sister is portrayed in a beautiful and moving way here, you can't help but fall in love with this movie. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates good anime. I'm usually really picky with movies as I watch loads however this movie met my high standards and thats why I've given it a 10/10. Its as good as 'Spirited away' which is also fantastic and if you enjoy this movie I recommend you watch that next. I'll be surprised if this movie does not make you cry :]

watch it :]!
