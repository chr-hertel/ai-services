My Take: Although dated in some areas, this is an enjoyable old-fashioned war adventure. 

"The Guns of Navarone" was considered by many as a classic WWII adventure. Considering a strong amount of talent, special effects and timely subject, it is. But time has not been real kind to it. To be fair to its many admirers, GUNS OF NAVARONE is exactly as entertaining as I expected it to be. The action was fairly strong as are the stellar performances. Still, it is bogged down by a slow paced first hour. Several moments of drama are injected as well in several elements that fail to withstand the test of time. But as pure WWII adventure, GUNSD OF NAVARONE is a strong trinket of war movie cinema. Well-acted, well-directed and rather enjoyable and exciting if it could be. 

The performances were great, especially by the leads, Gregory Peck, David Niven and Anthony Quinn. The direction by J. Lee Thompson is crackling, a superior job before he hit became a hack in the 80's. The entire film is well-done, although pretty dated to some. The Oscar-winning special effects are still effective, especially during the time-ticking climax. A flawed movie, but has emerged as a genre classic nonetheless. 

Rating: **** out of 5.
