First, let me tell you that I'm crazy. Why? Because I watched this movie three times. Let me tell you about those times, so you can form your own conclusions before I do.

The first time, I saw this movie alone. I was shocked by the horror we don't see (that's the best creep effect, if you ask me). I really believed this was the best film France ever made (actually, I forgot movie milestones like 'La Cage des Folles', 'Les Parapluies de Cherbourgh and many other titles). I said to myself everybody should see this movie to make the world a better place without hate.

The second time, I saw this movie together with my family. Yes, I know you're thinking right now I must be crazy. Perhaps... Who knows? You? Well, maybe I am a film freak, but I have a tender heart. That's the reason why I told my family they had to watch this to become more happy with the little problems we know. The past is over and done. Now we should be happy. Espascially thanks to this picture. But I had second thoughts about the value of the movie, because I saw it the second time.

Now, the third time, I saw this picture together with my friends, and though they adored it just as much as I did the first time I saw it, now I became tired of seeing the same picture for the third time.

So let's conclude this tale of love and misery with friends and family. I believe this movie has great value in movie history, but the story by itself doesn't have an important message.
