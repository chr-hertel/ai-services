EVERYONE said this was good, and I mean everyone. So I went and saw it (luckily with a free ticket). Needless to say, I was so disappointed I had to write this review.

Firstly, Ledger is amazing. Every time he spoke the screen captured my attention. I completely underestimated his ability throughout the film.

Secondly, the plot has many MANY **MANY** (read that: MANY) plot holes. Its like swiss cheese. I don't wish to write any spoilers, but suffice to say that nearly every scene, while they do contain transitions, is just barely connected to the previous. Dent's makeup was a bit over the top as well I felt.

The REAL problem with Dark Knight is the film itself. The plot, for how grainy it is, is still connected and very dark; yet the film is always BRIGHT. In most scenes everything is well lit, whites are shining, etc. This is easier to see while watching the film, but it felt as if no manner of actual camera-work was done to set the mood. A simple filter over the shots, or the lighting moved to the background would have gone a long way...but nothing in any shot showed any real emotion - colors are just all very bland, and often inappropriate.
