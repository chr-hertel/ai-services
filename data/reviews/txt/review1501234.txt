THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE is quite simply one of the BEST ever in the history of horror. Sure it's a little dated (it was made in 1974 and shot on 16mm film), but it's got the heart of a lion. The reason this film is considered an absolute classic is because regardless of the story not being 100% true, it FEELS so real. It's VERY believable that something like that can actually happen in real life. The fact that it's virtually bloodless/goreless, contradictory to what so many people have claimed over the years, shows just how much of an effect it has on the viewer. Also, notice there is NO musical score in the entire movie. Just odd sounds, screaming and a chainsaw buzzing, which only helps to create a terrifying atmosphere that seems so real. All of this and more is the reason why the slickly produced soul-less Hollywood remake can't touch the original. THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE belongs in EVERY horror fans collection.
