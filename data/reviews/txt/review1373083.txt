I saw the movie yesterday, and I was very satisfied with it. Don't listen to the critics! The movie was true to the book, and Ron Howard did a great job maintaining the integrity of the story and the characters. If you enjoyed reading the book, you'll appreciate the job that was done on this film. The dream-like sequences portraying the events leading up to the Templar Treasure and Robert Langdon's use of his "almost" eidetic memory to cipher out the clues were pure genius. Even though I knew how it would all turn out, I found myself enjoying the "ride" to the conclusion and felt the movie was definitely worth the price of a ticket. In fact, I plan to add it to my collection as soon as it is released on DVD.
