I was not expecting such a mediocre work from Gautam Ghosh, the director of "Paar". The film is extremely boring and slow. Nana Patekar and Rekha both are unbearable. This is so called meaningful cinema at worst.. in which u keep on finding some meaning and end up wasting two hours. Rekha as Lajwanti looks old and exhausted. One reason i decided to watch this movie was Khayyam's music but again the magic of Umrao Jaan and Bazaar was missing. The director in his pursuit of looking super intellectualism ends up putting some surrealistic nonsense. Nana Patekar for most part keeps on drinking again and again. Deepti Naval looks wasted. The problem is that the movie lacks a proper story or plot... or the story or plot is so complex that only Oscar Academy or Gautam Ghosh can understand that.
