Having recently watched the original version of "Don" with Amitabh on TV for eighteenth time, I was a bit sceptical about Shah Rukh Khan playing this role as well as the movie, although knowing that it was based on the original by Salim - Javed. But having seen this, I can say that I was totally glued to the screen and not only just with Shah Rukh "King" Khan's performance but also with performance by Priyanka Chopra as "Roma" and Boman Irani as "DCP DeSilva" as well as OM Puri. It was also nice to see Chunky Pandey after a long time, even though it was only at the beginning. The fight sequences as well as the computer visual effects are worthwhile to watch.

Sunidhi Chauhan has also done a magnificent job of the re-mix of "Yeh Mere Dil, Yaar Ke Deewana," which was originally sung by the evergreen Asha Bhonsle for Helen in the original. Farhan Akhtar has done an excellent job of this as have the musicians - Shankar Ehsan Loy.

The ending of this movie is different to the original and so since, Shah "King" Khan had said that if this "Don" is successful, then and only then a sequel would be considered. So watch out for the sequel of this.

Something of as a matter of interest here: Salim Khan of "Salim - Javed" is the father of actor Salman Khan, whose step mother is Helen(she's married to Salim Khan). Farhan Akhtar's father is Javed Akhtar of "Salim - Javed" - the duo who wrote the original "Don."
