A good concert will generate heat like a fire. And sometimes you feel you'll just melt away. So it was for me watching this brilliant film. Mick Jagger and the boys have traveled straight into history. It's as if they'd got hold of something that's eluded us all and, for me at least, they've left no doubt which band is the greatest, Beatles or Stones.

I originally didn't want to sit through a long concert. But I was wrong. There's nothing dull or repetitious in this movie and, in fact, there are some surprises including a gem of a Keith Richard rendition and a revealing duet between Mick and Jack White. The film is like a compilation of a thousand lucky catches. Mick's energy, musicality and playfulness come through loud and clear, and I began to wonder just how influential this band's been over the years.

As a guy, I know I always wanted to take notice and listen whenever they came up on somebody's playlist. The Beatles always seemed to be a more acceptable choice, even when it was a Stones' song that kept going through my mind. But after all these years, I've concluded that it was the Stones who had the stronger grasp on my generation's psyche. In some ways they seem more honest than the Beatles. Certainly they've had more fun over the years. I just heard someone list iconic British things to include Big Ben and the Beatles. I winced because I realized, if I were British, it would have been the Stones I would have mentioned. There's something miraculous about them that I can't help admiring.
