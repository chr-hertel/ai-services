I was the producer of this one hour film made for a British TV company but budgeted on a sale to ABC in America. It was based on a five page original story by Le Carre for which we paid an unreasonably large fee and scripted by Stanley Mann, a Canadian writer. It was directed by Ted Kotchef who went on to create the character RAMBO with Sylvester Stallone.

It was quite good and might stand up to a TV showing even now - but, of course, the Cold War background is very dated.
