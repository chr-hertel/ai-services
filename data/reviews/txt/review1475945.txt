This is a poorly shot and badly edited documentary on male (yes!) and female groupies from the US who spend all their time trying to bed visiting British musicians. Those wanting to see everything, will be disappointed, although there is some occasional nudity, albeit brief. The group are followed from gig to gig, and we get to see the girls putting on their makeup and best clothes, while reminiscing about previous successes. One tells how she started with The Four Tops! The women always seem to be drunk, or stoned, or both. As an Australian I found the male groupies bizarre, beyond belief. If nothing else it's a great time capsule of a bygone era. The musicians featured are Ten Years After, Joe Cocker, Terry Reid and Spooky Tooth. Their inclusion has earned an extra star. Frankly I'd rather have had more music and less of the groupies.
