Robert Redford is in excellent form as a lawyer and idealist persuaded to join campaign for the US Senate on the Democratic ticket as an automatic underdog; however, his off-the-cuff appeal manages to reach a great many more voters than first anticipated. Fascinating glimpse into the election process, with fashionably quizzical "what now?" finale. Acerbic direction from Michael Ritchie, who sees the appeal in the material and never clutters up the scenario. Ritchie also gets fine supporting performances from Melvyn Douglas, Peter Boyle and Don Porter. Jeremy Larner's solid original screenplay won an Oscar, though Ritchie and his editors spike the narrative a great deal with their prickly handling. Two Oscars nominations in all, including Best Sound; Larner also won the WGA award for Best Drama Written for the Screen. **1/2 from ****
