Similar to his other critically acclaimed epic MILLION DOLLAR BABY, Haggis seems to think, the easier, the simpler, the less complex a film the better for audiences. Similar to what he does with MDB, Haggis simplifies the story until it's down to basically broth but complicates the actual execution, a dozen or so characters careening around in LA "crashing" into each other with racism as a focal point.

The film focuses mostly on Graham (Cheadle) a detective within the LAPD (a great performance!) and his navigating a corrupt organization. There are side stories, including solid performances by Matt Dillion and Terrence Howard, but all in all the scenes are so contrived the meaning is laughable.
