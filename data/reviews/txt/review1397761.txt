Being a resident of the Twin Cities, I had to see this movie, as it was filmed just down the street in St. Paul. The movie wastes no time in getting right to the thick of things, and it took me a while to realize there wasn't going to be a big storyline to this movie. It simply was a look behind the scenes at the final showing of Prairie Home Companion's radio show.

After watching the movie, I had to drive over to Mickey's Diner in St. Paul and eat a late-night meal in the same booth the characters sat in at the end of the movie.

This was a pretty good watch. It was a solid, heartfelt, sometimes charming movie.
