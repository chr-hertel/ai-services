How is it possible to make such a bad movie from such a good idea? This basic set up could and should work as a comedy, a thriller or even a romantic film. This is just a mess. Do not waste your time or money seeing this film, it has no redeeming features it doesn't even work as "so bad its good". I watched this in a fairly full cinema. Apart from people getting up to leave it was almost silent. I stuck it out, after all as I said its a good basic idea, its got fairly good actors, it had to get better. It didn't. I found yourself siding with the Stepford husbands, but only because if one side could achieve total victory this awful awful film would end and I could go home.

Just to reiterate, this is the worst film I have ever seen.
