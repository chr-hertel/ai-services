If we're being honest Coming Home never really stood up to the excellence of Pilcher's book, so this sequel never really stood much of a chance. 

To be fair though if you can ignore the fact that the script is not good and the acting is infinitely worse then this is passable. The story isn't all that great but shines occasionally. But i think the biggest problem i had with the whole thing was the change of the main focus, i think it would have been better if they had focus on making the story around Judith and Jermemy. 

To sum up it is just about worth watching if you liked the first installment, but personally I prefer the book to them both!
