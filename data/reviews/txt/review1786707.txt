This movie healed me and couldn't have come at a better time. I only just saw this recently and what can I say, if you're 29 years or older and you listened to/participated in Hip Hop growing up then here is your Medicine......B*tches(!)

Dave is 31 at the time of filming(I'm 3 yr younger)and he and the artists who share the stage with him are also in the same age bracket and for Hip Hop, represent the last of the 'Golden Era' children.

I myself grew up near Toronto and started making beats at age 12 in 1988(been listening since 84). I had the fortune of gaining respect and many friends with this music and will always hold it dear to me. Watch this movie and you will feel the same way if not for the love of the music(trust me on this one, this has some Woodstock moments but I won't give it away) then at the very least because of the richness of this movie as a documentary thanks to Michel Gondry and all. Many wonderful people are documented along the way, some famous, some not, and as a decadent contrast we have this surprise concert which is Dave's brainchild and lifelong dream and we get the treat of watching this fateful day in Bed-Stuy in glorious surround sound in the comfort of our own home. Oh and did I mention Dave supplies the comic relief?

CHERISH THIS FOR YEARS TO COME - A HIP HOP ESSENTIAL!!!!! ... ...... ........."Do You Want More?!!!??!"
