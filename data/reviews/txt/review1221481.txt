"S.H. Faces Death" is another splendidly directed adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's immortal writings. Doyle's hero Holmes, for whom even the most complex murder-motives appear to be obvious, this time helps his loyal sidekick Watson when a series of murders terrorizes the convalescent home where he does volunteering work. The culprit clearly selects his victims with specific reasons, as Sherlock's investigation leads toward the family history of the mansion's owners; the Musgraves. Even more compelling than the intelligent script of this film are some ingenious findings that increase the mysteriousness, like the eerie clock that always strikes thirteen times shortly before another murder is committed. Notably also is the terrific old-dark-house setting with its secret corridors, ominous greenhouse and deep dark cellars. Roy William Neill directs his second Sherlock Holmes movie, after the Washington adventure, released earlier that same year. His coordination is surefooted and definitely faithful to Doyle's initial presentation of the gifted detective. Basil Rathbone's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes remains outstanding and he's the only actor (maybe alongside Peter Cushing) who turns the character's typical arrogance into an extra trump. This isn't my favorite Holmes-movie (I'm hopelessly addicted to "The Hound of the Baskervillers") but it sure is a highly recommended mystery/thriller.
