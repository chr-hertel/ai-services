The craft that went into this movie is astounding. After watching all of the special edition material, I really gained a greater appreciation from this movie. The sound effects add such a greater depth to the film, the new cleaned up soundtrack adds such a great dimension that completes the whole world of the movie. The cinematography, atmosphere, added special effects are excellent as well.. and I disagree with the naysayers who don't think the added effects are called for. They just complete the vision of the director. 

I think the reason I like it so much though is because I can very much believe the storyline, I can see our society turning into the world of THX... it's about a quarter of the way there.
