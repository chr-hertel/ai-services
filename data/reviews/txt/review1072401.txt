This is a delightful tale of a divorced woman, her daughter, and the nutty "older" man who invades their lives with his illness and neuroses. This is a class act of a comedy in the hands of two real masters, Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, beautifully supported by Amada Peet, Frances McDormand, and the ever-handsome Keanu Reeves.

Keaton once again proves she is one of our greatest actresses, playing a successful playwright who, somewhere along the line, forgot about love and romance while living in high style in the Hamptons and New York City. Then her beautiful young daughter brings home a 63-year-old commitmentaphobe and the fun begins. And it is fun. Keaton has a glorious crying scene that should have won her an Oscar. Her timing is impeccable.

Frances McDormand is one of my favorite actresses and, though I enjoyed her as Keaton's sister, the role seemed small and inconsequential for a woman of her enormous talents. My only other complaint about the film is that I think 15 minutes could have been easily cut. It went on a little too long.

These are minor complaints. As a baby boomer, I love seeing women over 50 in lead roles and, as an adult, it's great to see a sophisticated, funny story for a change.
