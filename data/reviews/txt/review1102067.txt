The last and most critically acclaimed film of Kiewslowski's trilogy, this entry is however not as technically impressive as the first film, nor as intriguing in terms of plot as the second film, which can only make me wonder why it is considered to be the best by so many. Make no mistake: this is another fine entry in the saga and a good film in itself, but it just does not throw a punch like the first two films. It is very slow moving throughout, which is not necessarily a bad thing, however the purpose of the pace is a bit ambiguous, and in addition the events and characters are not all clearly defined. It still has very interesting individual ideas, some good cinematography and lighting, plus there is a lot of attention paid to sound. There is quite a bit to take out of it, but I personally found more to take out of 'Bleu' and 'Blanc'.
