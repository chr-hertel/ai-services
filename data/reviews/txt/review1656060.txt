actually i wanted to give this movie 9/10 but after seeing how bad it rates i had to give it one more star because it really shouldn't be that much of an underdog. sometimes i don't know why i adore this movie, it's just so much pleasure to watch, great music, great cast cane as governor, connolly as a rebel, both giving brilliant roles, valerie perrine as a rich heir going environmentalist, brenda vaccaro as a hot-blooded guatemalan, what more do you need for a great movie :) it's the essence of life without all the drama, money and rush. so, wear your favorite hawaiian t-shirt, grab the bottle of water and watch this beauty :)
