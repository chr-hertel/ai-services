I'm going to keep this short 'cos I think everything's been said, but I just wanna say that, in my opinion, people are far too harsh on this movie.

I've been a Star Trek fan since the late 80's when I was a kid, and this movie didn't disappoint. People need to lighten up! Also, everyone seems to blame the director, and I admit, I don't agree with the choice of scenes that he cut from the movie - The film would've been better if the scenes had been left alone, but if someone doesn't like the script or story, then shouldn't it be the writers to blame and NOT the director (Stuart Baird)? 

OK, Nemesis failed at the box office, but that doesn't make it a bad film, just nobody wanted to see it. How would they know how good or bad something really is without seeing it for themselves? I think audiences just got tired of Star trek in general, and unfortunately, this meant that Nemesis (and Star Trek: Enterprise)had to suffer. Not to mention that it opened at the same time as some SERIOUS competition at the time. Lord of the rings - Harry Potter.

The only thing that I do agree with is that this wasn't the best film to end 'The Next Gen' series of films. I think they deserved two or at least one more to wrap things up properly. But I guess that'll never happen! On a whole, I loved Nemesis (better than Insurrection, even though I like that too) and would give it 10 out of 10 anytime!
