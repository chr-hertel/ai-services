I've seen the stage version 3 times. Was hoping the movie to be good too, but it doesn't deliver.

One problem is the cast. None of the big names are much above amateur level in singing, unlike the leads in Chicago. It really distracts from the songs. As for the acting, I felt Streep did a bad job with "The Winner takes it all" by resorting to pantomime (pointing to the sky for "the Gods", throwing her hands for "roll a dice", crouching for "staying low" ...) Though her acting in "Slipping through my fingers" was exquisite.

The other problem is the transition from stage to screen. Apart from the fantastic outdoor scenery, there is not much improvement. You can forgive certain things on a stage play, like being dumped into the middle of the story in the first few minutes, or jarring transitions, but on the big screen these problems are magnified. And not only are these issues retained, some of the character interactions are even more truncated than the stage version! Lastly, the final "encore" numbers on stage got the audience on their feet. Here the energy just peters out.

The one clever thing introduced here is having the Greek ladies etc. comment on the action just like a Greek Chorus. As well, the full blown fantasy segment of "Money money money" was great.

I would have given 5 stars if not for the music.
