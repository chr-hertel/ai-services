When I first watched this film I did so on cable and with no real enthusiasm, since I seemed like it was a Spirited Away rip-off. The view of the film is very similar.

However, I fell in love with the story, more so than I did with Spirited Away, it had a more grown-up aspect to it and it was still as magical as Spirited away.

A story about courage, dealing with what you're given and it's so romantic that keeps you touched all the way through and allows you into the fantastic world that is Howl's Moving Castle.

Maybe not as artistic in the making as Spirited away (although it's very artistic on its own), but I find the story just as beautiful or even more so. The movie looks well, it'll keep you entertained and it's not very long either, not slow-paced at all and simply beautiful to watch.
