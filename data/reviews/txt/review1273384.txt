I'm sure someone will find some obscure flaw to this film, but how or where I'm not sure. BOYS OF BARAKA is not just great, it's one of the most important documentaries I've ever seen about American life -- and life in general. Even the comparable HOOP DREAMS seems rather slight compared to this great film. I hope the filmmakers make a follow-up film about 3, 5 or 10 years from now. And I hope some of these kids get to go back to Baraka, either as students, visitors or teachers.

Since I need 10 total lines to make a review, I'll just say:
