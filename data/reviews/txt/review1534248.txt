i wonder how people could laugh on such silly so called jokes of this movie,this movie is for kids,and i don't think they can also laugh on this, i had high expectations of this movie,but this is the worst movie i have ever seen , it sucks. i found no see laughable,its dumb. IMDb ratings are not perfect at all , no wonder movies like this make to 8.4 and many good movies which are not much popular makes in to 3 or 4 points there are so many classic comedy movies of old times which are much below rated here, this movie doesn't really deserve a rating above 4,i am thankfull that i didn't buy a original DVD of this movie,don't waste ur money on this
