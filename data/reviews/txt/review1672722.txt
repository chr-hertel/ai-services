Movie made showing the inhuman conditions of a chain gang. Duke Ellis (Richard Dix) is ready to escape until he sees his younger brother Johnny (Tom Brown) is being sent to the same prison. He decides to stay and protect him...but Johnny has a quick temper...

The acting is just so-so (Dix is the worst offender), the dialogue and violence are pretty tame and this is very dated but it's still a good drama. It deals fairly realistically with the terrible conditions and doesn't hold back. Racism is dealt with and there's even an obviously gay prisoner! There's nothing shocking or new here by today's standards but this must have packed quite a punch back in 1932. The only really bad part is the ridiculously happy ending that was so improbable that I was almost laughing! Still, this is worth catching. A 7.
