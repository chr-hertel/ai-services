This is a very difficult WM to write about, partly because it's in the between an excellent PPV and a crap PPV category. Some matches were ace, some weren't.

Results from Wrestlemania X-8 are as follows: - Rob Van Dam defeated William Regal to win the Intercontinental Championship in a solid opener.


* Diamond Dallas Page defeated Christian in a useless match.



* Spike Dudley defeated Goldust to win the Hardcore title (this match was Maven and Goldust, but Dudley ran down and pinned Goldust) - Edge pinned Booker T in a worthless match.



* 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin pinned Scott hall in a rotten match (this showed when Austin walked out of the Federation for real shortly afterwards) 



* Kurt Angle defeated Kane in a good match.



* The Hurricane defeated Spike Dudley to win the Hardcore title (backstage) 



* The Undertaker pinned Ric Flair in a fair match.



* Mighty Molly pinned The Hurricane to win the Hardcore title (backstage) - The Rock defeated Hollywood Hogan in a very good match. The fans in this match were simply mad! They cheered Hogan instead of The Rock.



* Christian pinned Mighty Molly to win the Hardcore title (backstage when Christian slammed a door in Molly's face) 



* Billy and Chuck defeated The APA, The Hardy Boyz and The Dudley Boyz in a four corners match to retain the WWE tag team belts.



* Maven pinned Christian to win back the Hardcore title (in the car parking lot when Christian was day dreaming, Maven snuck up behind him and pinned him) 



* Jazz defeated Lita and Trish Stratus to retain the WWE Women's Championship.



* The Rock pinned Hulk Hogan. The fans were really into this match. However fans booed Rock and cheered Hogan.



* Triple H defeated Chris Jericho to win the Undisputed Championship. However fans were not that interested in this match and when Tripper won no one cared.
