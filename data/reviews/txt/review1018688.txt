when i watched this movie, i was a little sceptical of the overall impact that it would have after reading the review on this site.

However, I have really enjoyed this movie, a click flick but a really enjoyable one.

If you want a couple of hours to watch a movie that makes you feel good this is it....

Laura Linney is a very entertaining and capable actress and very believable to watch. 

This film is a little slow to start but once it has got you, you will be hooked to see the end.
