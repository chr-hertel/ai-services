I don't think it's exactly fair to bash George Lucas. Sure the Original Trilogies were great and you people only expected better and when Lucas didn't meet your demands you were disappointed. If you guys think about it, the story of this movie had to be focused around love or it wouldn't make sense. Now I know it wasn't a stellar performance by the actors but it isn't all their fault. Sometimes the director needs to help that. I must say though I am glad Hayden has moved on from being the whiny teenager in this movie and to a more mature Anakin Skywalker in ROTS.

Overall, the special effects team did a fantastic job. It was insane on the things they did. I didn't think it looked like a video game. In my opinion it looked very real. It didn't look animated. They did a nice job with the Clone Wars and such. And of course the lightsabre battles were superb. I must say not his greatest but a much improvement.
