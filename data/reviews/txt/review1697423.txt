When I rented this movie two days ago I thought that it was gonna be another clumsy and boring movie about farm animal and a boy, but I said what the heck lets give it a try, and I notice that I was so mistaken. This is such and emotional and touching film, so funny and entertaining, with very good action and adventure. A very nice option to spend a very good time with the family cause it has some messages like you don't have to judge a book by its cover until you discover what's inside, that the home is where the heart is and there's never to old to live your life to the fullest. Its like Tim Burton's Big Fish but more oriented to kids. The story is very interesting and the plot is incredible and convincing. The cast is simply incredible, to watch Michael Caine and Robert Duvall acting together is a real joy, they really deliver us a pair of flawless performances, Haley Joel Osment acting was really good too in a role that fitted him really well, first as a nervous and kind of geek boy that learns how to have a good and fully life with his uncles. Nice CG effects to recreate the Europe of the 30's. Also very good soundtrack, its just like country type music full of rhythm and very cheerful. The landscapes are beautiful, full of color. In conclusion this was a very enjoyable movie for all kind of people.
