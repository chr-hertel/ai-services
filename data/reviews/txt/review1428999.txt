As far as modern dubbed Asian action comedies go this was probably one of the best starting out with an hilarious kung Fu baby beating up some bad guys, what's not to like! (it's been a while since i've seen this movie so i might be thinking of something else)After that however the movie only gets worse and worse as the jokes are recycled over and over again and we can't be bothered even to fake a laugh anymore, not only that but the storyline, which i've forgotten, is so weak that there is nothing to fall back on when the slapstick runs out and we can't be arsed finding anymore problems with the dubbing. Basically the only people that have the energy and short enough memory span to be amused by this all the way to the end are small children and a few mentally severe old people. For the rest of us though the film will be forgotten quickly especially since the most memorable thing in it was the goddamn baby.
