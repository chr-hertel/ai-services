Playmania is the American version of TV quiz shows that are popular in the UK. It's a great show to watch even if you don't enter the games, mostly because of the hosts. Shandi Finnessey, Miss USA 2004, is fun and easy on the eyes. But Mel Peachey (and that is the proper way to spell her last name, with two "e"s) is something else. She was brought over as a veteran of the British quiz programs, and it's a good thing, too! I could watch her read the phone book for two hours. She is easily the best import from the UK since Doctor Who.

Some of the games are better than others but that is to be expected in a format like this. Some of my favorites are Missing Link, AlphaBucks and the Top 5 surveys. I'm not too keen on Crosswords because there is no way to narrow down the possibilities. There could be ten wrong guesses and you are no closer than you were at the start. And whatever happened to Lingo? You'd think GSN would keep it for the cross-promotional opportunity.
