The movie is horrible, the characters are shallow not to mention that the scriptwriters actually rewrote "history" (homer's Iliad). And something else, couldn't they make the war last a bit longer? Homer said it lasted 10 years not a couple of days! Not to mention other major differences from what Homer wrote: 1: Agamemnon is killed! 2. Menelaos is not only killed, but he's killed by Ektor. 3. Ector's family escapes from troy with the help of Achileas(who actually should't be there because he's killed before troy is taken from some kind of backdoor. Well all i have to say is that i should have heard my sister and never watched that movie
