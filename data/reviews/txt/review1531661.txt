i had the pleasure seeing the film at a festival - and i quite liked it. i think it captures very much the mood of capri. a place where everyone and everything seems to be ambiguous all the time. on the surface capri seems to be the best spot on earth but if you stay there for a longer period you feel the ennui creeping up your capri sandals... behind the splendor of all the magnificent holiday homes of the rich and beautiful. it is an untypical "german" comedy because it feels more french than the stuff which normally is successful in Germany e.g. "bullyparade" or "otto und die sieben zwerge". ps: one thing i didn't quite like was the voice of one of the actresses - she sounded like minnie mouse (but maybe the sound system at the cinema was out of the shape).
