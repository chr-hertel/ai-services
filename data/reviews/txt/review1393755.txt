This movie was so stupid with Paul Walker it was fine but it had so much gangster stuff and Tyrese and Luducris and that Asian girl are horrible actors\actresses and Paul Walker wasn't very good. Also might I add that this movie didn't have any action except for the part when they had to find Cole Hauser's cigar and it was boring and stupid and shouldn't get 5 stars just 2 stars is what it should get which is what I gave it. For the Friday The 13th fans out there this is for you Friday The 13th is crappy but it is better then 2F2F also Steven Segal movies are a better choice of movies to watch instead of 2F2F also Pinata: Survival Island is a better movie to watch................ JUST KIDDING!
