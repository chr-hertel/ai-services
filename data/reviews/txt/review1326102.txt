Once u see Stay Alive, u realize something: Hollywood is running out of ideas. The idea of a "kiler game" is really just a rip-off of the "killer-tape" (i.e. Ring). This movie is a prime example of modern horror movie's lack of quality.In fact, this movie has a number of LOL moments, several of which are not even supposed to be funny. However, this movie can be slightly-entertaining, if u get over the horrid plot, the foolish actions, and its other problems. So, if u want to watch a horror movie just to kill some time, or to see something different, u may want to view Stay Alive. However, if u want to see a good horror movie, then DO NOT see this film
